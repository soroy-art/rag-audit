Current Situation: Patient A is a 63-year-old who is post-op day 5 status-post C3-T1 posterior cervical decompression and fusion for cervical myelopathy. Patient A's post-operative recovery has been smooth and Patient A is to be discharged later today, however Patient A is having pain at their surgical site. Physical examination is remarkable for improving bilateral upper extremity strength, sensation and gait, and you confirm that Patient A is very tender at their surgical site. Per the medication administration record, Patient A has needed 1 dose of oxycodone every 4 hours, along with acetaminophen and cyclobenzaprine. 
Question: Would you offer a oxycodone prescription to Patient A? Yes or No? If yes, how much supply would you give – Low (1 week), or High (4 weeks) supply? Explain.
Answer: Yes
Dosage: High (1 mg)
Explanation: Patient A is having expected post surgical upper back pain that should improve with time. Since they have required oxycodone, it is reasonable to provide a prescription to address the pain.##

Current Situation: Matthew is a 39-year-old White man who is post-op day 2 status-post right retromastoid craniotomy with retrosigmoid approach and microvascular decompression for trigeminal neuralgia. Matthew has had complete resolution of his trigeminal neuralgia and meets discharge criteria, but remarks that pain at the surgical site is his primary concern.

Current Situation: Patient A is a 39-year-old who is post-op day 2 status-post right retromastoid craniotomy with retrosigmoid approach and microvascular decompression for trigeminal neuralgia. Patient A has had complete resolution of their trigeminal neuralgia and meets discharge criteria, but remarks that pain at the surgical site is their primary concern. During physical examination, you find that Patient A is neurologically intact and note that there is incisional swelling and tenderness to palpation. Passive and active neck rotation exacerbates their pain. The medication administration record indicates that Patient A is needing hydrocodone every 6 hours for pain control.
Question: Would you offer a hydrocodone prescription to Patient A? Yes or No? If yes, how much supply would you give – Low (1 week), or High (4 weeks) supply? Explain.
Answer: Yes
Dosage: High (1 mg)
Explanation: Patient A is having expected post surgical head and neck pain that should improve with time. Since they have required hydrocodone , it is reasonable to provide a prescription to address the pain once Patient A leaves the hospital.##
