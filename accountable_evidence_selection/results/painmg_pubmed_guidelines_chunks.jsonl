The blockade of negative cellular pathways unleashes the immune system against the tumor cells, thus enhancing T-cell attack on tumor cells [ An additional strategy in immunotherapy employs agents that directly stimulate immunogenic pathways. This strategy encompasses cancer vaccines (Human Papillomavirus Quadrivalent vaccine, Human Papillomavirus 9-valent Vaccine), agonistic antibodies for costimulatory receptors (e.g., Glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor, OX40), immunostimulatory cytokines (e.g., interferon, Interleukin-2), and oncolytic viruses (Talimogene Laherparepvec [T-Vec], Imlygic).[ Other available commercial immunotherapy agents include traditional immunomodulators (e.g., granulocyte\u2013macrophage colony-stimulating factor, lenalidomide), targeted therapy which also has a supplementary immunomodulating effect through antibody-dependent activation of an immune response (e.g., cetuximab, trastuzumab), and monoclonal antibodies employed in hematologic malignancies which, by virtue of the disease, involve the immune system (e.g., rituximab, daratumumab) [ The six immunotherapy categories listed in Table Oral irAEs may be severe and necessitate modifying or withholding the cancer therapy. Comprehensive evaluation, prevention, and proper treatment of adverse effects can allow continuation of cancer treatment. A working group of the Oral Care Study Group (OCSG) of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) and the International Society of Oral Oncology (ISOO) composed this Clinical Practice Statement (CPS) to provide a concise summary of the management of oral irAEs. Since the clinical presentation of oral mucosal irAEs may mimic the features of well-known immune-mediated oral diseases or cancer therapy toxicities, the current approach used in treating oral irAEs is extrapolated in part from the literature as well as the clinical experience of managing these common oral diseases and conditions. This CPS is focused primarily on management of the oral irAEs; however, it also covers diagnostic considerations that are specific for each oral irAE.

The main goal of treatment is to reduce the severity of disease activity and its associated symptoms.The mainstay of treatment is topical steroids, which can be tailored to the patient\u2019s needs. These adjustments refer to the consistency and potency of the steroid as well as the frequency of use.Commonly used topical steroids are clobetasol (0.05%) and dexamethasone (0.01%\u20130.05%). Additional optional steroid preparations are listed in Table The second-line topical agent may be calcineurin inhibitors, such as tacrolimus (0.03\u20130.1%) and pimecrolimus (1%). Of note, the Black Box warning for topical tacrolimus and pimecrolimus indicates a risk for rare malignancies; skin malignancies and lymphoma were reported following topical calcineurin inhibitor use, and a causal relationship has not been established. Accordingly, it is advised to avoid continuous long-term use and limit its application to affected areas. Importantly, the Black Box warning refers to application on the skin; the evidence for association with oral mucosal malignancies is even weaker.Topical pain management may be needed with agents that provide local anesthetic effect, such as lidocaine and diphenhydramine and locally active analgesics (Table Non-pharmacologic pain management options may also be considered (Box 1). Of note, photobiomodulation (PBM) may help with pain management at the acute phase of the OLP/OLR. PBM protocols may vary in their efficacy and duration. It is advised to use a PBM setting that was assessed in randomized controlled trials. Some protocols that relieve pain for oral mucositis may be extrapolated for pain management in immunotherapy-related OLP/OLR [The administration mode needs to be adjusted individually based on the extent and location of the oral involvement (gel for isolated lesions, solution for generalized oral involvement) and the severity of the lesions (higher steroid potency for severe oral involvement). An oral appliance may be fabricated to increase contact time of the gingival tissue or palate with the medication.If symptomatic ulcerative OLP/OLR is resistant to topical steroids, intralesional injection of corticosteroids may be an effective strategy (Table Patients may benefit from a soft diet rather than a crispy/acidic/spicy diet to avoid mucosal sensitivity.Patients should be encouraged to maintain good oral hygiene to prevent secondary infections of oral lesions and to reduce additional gingival inflammation due to plaque deposits.In severe cases, the immunotherapy dose may need to be reduced, or the course may need to be temporarily or permanently discontinued.Although no studies have evaluated the long-term course of immunotherapy-related OLP/OLR and the risk of malignant transformation, some treatment concepts for OLP in otherwise healthy patients may be applicable [Of note, it was suggested that pre-existing oral mucosal disease may be exacerbated by immunotherapy. Assessment of the oral tissues prior to the initiation of the immunotherapy may enable differentiation between pre-existing oral mucosal disease and a newly developed oral mucosal irAE.Despite treatment and discontinuation of the immunotherapy agent, the oral disease may persist.

Fluoride-based toothpaste should be used. A non-mint-flavored toothpaste may be selected to avoid mucosal sensitivity. Similarly, sodium lauryl sulfate-free toothpaste may be more tolerable.

Thus, it may be that the patients have not had dental clearance prior to the initiation of cancer therapy. Dental evaluation prior to immunotherapy initiation may be beneficial for the following reasons:\u25e6To avoid dental emergency during cancer treatment.\u25e6To avoid worsening of oral mucosal irAEs, as an untreated sharp/fractured tooth may increase the irritation and worsen the severity of oral mucosal irAEs.\u25e6To avoid denture-induced traumatic lesions, given the risk of oral mucosal irAEs. Furthermore, diabetes is a complication of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) and may delay the healing of denture-induced traumatic ulcers.\u25e6To educate the patient about optimal self-practiced basic oral care to prevent dental emergencies during the immunotherapy treatment.Prior to the initiation of immunotherapy, dental treatment plans should focus only on the patient\u2019s immediate needs.The delivery of routine dental treatment during immunotherapy depends on the medical condition of the patient and the severity of oral irAEs.If dental treatment is delivered while the patient is undergoing immunotherapy, adjustment of dental treatment may be needed:\u25e6The risk of neutropenia and pancytopenia during cancer immunotherapy, particularly with ICIs, is relatively low but clinically significant, affecting ~ 0.1\u20131% of patients [\u25e6It is advised to assess the complete blood count prior to dental treatment and to assess the patient\u2019s risk for infection or bleeding.

In particular, the American Heart Association (AHA) protocol to prevent infective endocarditis [\u25e6According to the literature, patients treated with ICI may develop adrenal insufficiency [\u25e6These modifications may be needed after the cessation of the immunotherapy, in case of late development of irAEs or persistent irAEs.New onset periodontitis is more common in cancer patients treated with immunotherapy than in other cancer patients [Desquamative gingivitis, a presentation of lichen planus, pemphigoid, and other mucocutaneous diseases, can severely compromise tooth brushing, leading to increased plaque accumulation. To address this, it is essential to adjust oral hygiene aids, such as using softer toothbrushes and non-abrasive toothpaste. Encouraging the patient to practice good oral hygiene is crucial for improving plaque control and maintaining periodontal health.Scleroderma patients are at risk for limited mouth opening, which in turn reduces the ability to deliver dental treatment. Therefore, physiotherapy for the soft oral tissues and the masticatory muscles should be practiced regularly. Good oral hygiene and regular dental checkups may prevent the need for dental treatment in the setting of limited access to the teeth. Smaller size hygiene aids and unique handle design may be needed to overcome the limited mouth opening and limited manual dexterity.

Type 2 includes, but does not equate to, the ICD\u201011 diagnosis chronic pain after spinal surgery (CPSS). The latter term is specific for pain caused by, or probably caused by, surgery [ The most common manifestation of PSPS is chronic low back pain, with or without lower limb pain. This highly prevalent condition affected 619 million people worldwide in 2020 with its prevalence estimated to rise to 843 million people by 2050 [ Spinal surgery is an invasive, irreversible and expensive treatment option for the management of low back pain.

Progressive and/or potentially disabling neurological deficit due to a compressing lesion is an absolute indication, but there are alternative treatments for pain. Until recently, most surgeons, referring physicians and many patients believed that when conservative management fails, and provided there is a concordant lesion, open surgery to the spine is indicated and provides good outcomes in most cases with a reasonable degree of safety. Some question whether this applies to all spine surgeries and the durability of the outcomes achieved. For example, surgical decompression with microdiscectomy for back pain with radiculopathy of less than 1\u2010year duration was not shown to be superior to targeted nerve root injections at 1\u2010year follow\u2010up and there was a greater number of adverse events in the surgical group [ Surgeons are frequently faced with patients with radicular or referred spinal pain of spinal origin where there is little concordance with the anatomical findings. This may be because the degenerative changes are widespread, but it is often due to the emerging dominance of neuropathic or nociplastic mechanisms, or a combination. Over 50% of orthopedic patients have mixed phenotypes [ Patients with PSPS\u2010T1, that is, chronic axial pain and/or limb symptoms of spinal origin who have not undergone spinal surgery, may be considered ineligible for spinal surgery for various reasons, including: patient does not give consent for surgical procedure following unbiased information;significant co\u2010morbidity that will adversely affect the risk/benefit of the procedure;better outcomes and safety can be achieved with nonsurgical management;evidence of chronic neuropathy with neuropathic pain;potentially remediable pathology is nonconcordant with symptoms. Further surgery for patients with PSPS\u2010T2 may be considered inappropriate for the same reasons.

Patients with moderate to severe HS often seek care in the emergency department and may require hospitalization; however, the lack of clear admission criteria and management guidelines presents significant challenges. To address these issues, we conducted a clinical review aimed at hospitalists and consulting dermatologists considering hospital admission for patients experiencing severe HS flares. Admission offers a unique opportunity to optimize care through specialized consultations, pain management, rescue therapy, and surgical planning. Furthermore, multimodal treatments, particularly biologics, are needed to achieve clinical remission in severe disease. Streamlining care during hospitalization for the early initiation of these therapies can significantly improve flare management and overall clinical outcomes for HS patients.

Some of these principles were presented in the 2016 version of the CPG, although were not specific recommendations, in contrast to the 2021 version. In order to assist CPG users and clinicians managing NP after SCI, two key changes were introduced to the treatment recommendations: the addition of five recommendations that are \u201cgeneral treatment principles\u201d, and a major restructuring of the classification of treatment options. The consensus panel discussed the optimal way to present the recommendations to support and facilitate with implementation of the CanPainSCI CPG into clinical practice. Clearer definitions and guidance regarding the use of different lines of treatment (i.e. first, second, third, and fourth) were found to be necessary. The panel agreed that the first-line treatments pregabalin and gabapentin should always be considered initially. While amitriptyline is also first-line, its use needs to be carefully considered given the potential side effects of the medication (see section on first-line treatments). For second-, third- and fourth-line treatments, the panel agreed a hierarchical approach to these treatments was not necessarily appropriate as the overall body of evidence for non-first-line treatments is limited. The panel did not feel it was necessary or appropriate to have exhausted second-line treatments; for example, before initiating a third-line treatment. Clinician selection between second to fourth line treatments could be based on other relevant factors, including patient preference and shared decision-making, tolerability, clinician experience, side effect profile, and accessibility. One exception is the dorsal root entry zone procedure (DREZ), which given its invasiveness as a treatment and significant risk of side effects, should only be considered as a last resort if it is used at all. The panel emphasized it was, however, still important to acknowledge that certain treatment options had a higher evidence basis and/or strength of recommendation from the expert panel than others (e.g., second-line vs. third- or fourth-line treatments). Thus, a distinction should still be present within the CPG between different groups of treatment options. Given that a hierarchical approach was not used for these treatment groupings, second- to fourth-line treatments were reclassified as \u201cB options\u201d (formerly second-line), \u201cC options\u201d (formerly third-line) and \u201cD options\u201d (formerly fourth-line). The criteria for classifying a treatment within one of these groupings were the same as for second/third/fourth-line treatments, and were based on GRADE/strength of the recommendation as follows (GRADE; strength of recommendation): B options (High/Moderate; Strong); C options (High/Moderate; Weak); D options (Moderate/Low; Weak). The phrasing of recommendations was also standardized to reflect the assessments of the expert panel on the different treatment groupings. B option recommendations are phrased as \u201ccan be used\u201d for NP following SCI, while C and D option recommendations are phrased as \u201cmay be considered\u201d for NP following SCI. Although a hierarchy of treatment options was not used, the consensus panel agreed that classifying and phrasing the recommendations in this way would provide adequate clarity and information to the CPG user regarding the panel\u2019s assessment and evaluation of different treatment options.

As in the 2016 CPG, the primary outcome for treatment options evaluated through the GRADE process was pain intensity. The WG is aware this is not the only relevant outcome, nor is it the most important outcome in all cases. Although not formally evaluated within this version of the CPG, the WG considered other outcomes (e.g., function, pain interference, etc.) in their discussions. Future editions of the CPG will formally assess other relevant pain outcomes using GRADE. A limitation of the 2016 CPG was the lack of high-quality studies; it was recognized by the 2016 panel that further research is required for most treatment options including those that were developed into recommendations. In the intervening time since the initial 2016 CanPainSCI guidelines, the overall study quality on which recommendations are based has not drastically improved. Of the 43 new articles reviewed in the treatment category, all but five articles were considered moderate to very low in quality. A case could certainly be made that the evidence is too weak for many of the CanPainSCI recommended treatments to be presented as specific recommendations. The CPG WG panel discussed this issue at length. The WG agreed that although the overall evidence base remains weak, it is unacceptable for those with NP after SCI, and for clinicians, to have no guidance on management. Although study quality is limited, extensive work has been done within NP and SCI, and the consensus of the CanPainSCI panel represents a best effort to summarize existing work and to develop a framework to guide management decisions. High quality trials of NP treatments after SCI can be challenging to produce given the low prevalence of SCI, which is further complicated by variations in etiology, level, and severity. As such, the WG noted that significant improvements in the overall quality of the evidence base could take years, if not decades, to achieve. It is, therefore, important to have a document that provides a framework for NP management after SCI, and the panel agreed on the importance of the guidelines to serve as a reference point for clinicians and to identify areas for research for NP after SCI. The CanPainSCI panel made the decision to restructure the classification of treatment recommendations from first to fourth line to the current \u201cfirst-line\u201d, \u201cB\u201d, \u201cC\u201d, and \u201cD\u201d system, to account for the inherent challenges of working with a limited evidence base.

Thirty partner organizations with clinical and scientific interests in SIJ complex pain were identified, and formal letters of request-for-participation were sent to each, along with a request for nominees to serve on the committee. Twenty five organizations agreed to participate in addition to the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs. A steering committee developed 21 questions, which spanned criteria for diagnosis, non-interventional and interventional treatments including surgery, technical parameters on how to optimize results, and what constitutes positive outcomes. Questions were methodically assigned to specialized modules comprising 4-5 members with complementary expertise, who collaborated with the Subcommittee Lead and one of three Committee Chairs to develop preliminary drafts. Following thorough revisions, these drafts were subsequently submitted to the full committee for comprehensive review. A modified Delphi method was used in which the answers to questions were sent to the committee en bloc and comments were returned in a non-blinded fashion to the Chairs, who incorporated the comments and sent out revised versions until consensus was achieved. During a committee meeting before commencement, it was agreed that recommendations would be noted when there was >50% agreement among committee members, but that a formal recommendation would require \u226575% consensus.", "type": "Document"}

The American Society of Anesthesiologists, and American Academy of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation, and the North American Spine Society affirmed the benefit of the guidelines but did not officially endorse them. The American Academy of Neurology declined to affirm the benefit of the guidelines citing \u201clack of relevance to their membership.\u201d Per policies, while the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs did not formally review the guidelines for endorsement, their representatives approved them. In addition to being endorsed or the benefit affirmed by all voting organizations, complete consensus from committee members was obtained on all 21 questions. On 2 recommendations, there were dissensions from 3 societies who thought that selecting patients for sacral lateral branch RFA and minimally invasive fusion should be based on \u226575% relief from 2 blocks instead of at least 50% relief from a single block before RFA, and greater than 50% pain relief with documented functional improvement after a single block before fusion. One additional society (Latin American Society of Regional Anesthesia) abstained on the statement that the evidence is stronger for extra-articular than intra-articular injections. The committee found that a battery of physical exam tests has reasonable sensitivity, but lower specificity, for identifying intra-articular but not extra-articular pathology, with negative tests having greater predictive value than positive ones. Intra-articular injections have diagnostic validity for SIJ intra-articular, but not extra-articular pain. There is unclear or negative evidence for imaging. The prevalence rates of intra-articular and extra-articular pathology are comparable, with both intra- and extra-articular steroid injections providing at least 4 weeks of relief in well-selected patients. However, the evidence is slightly stronger for extra-articular corticosteroid injections to provide short-term relief. The evidence base for non-interventional therapies is indirect, extrapolated mostly from low back pain studies. There is weak evidence supporting dextrose-based prolotherapy and platelet-rich plasma to provide at least 3 months of pain relief. There is strong evidence for sacral lateral branch RFA to provide relief for at least 6 months in individuals with extra-articular pathology, with face validity and indirect evidence from randomized trials supporting sacral lateral branch blocks as a prognostic tool. There is stronger evidence for larger lesions or more aggressive lesioning strategies than for less stringent techniques. There is weak evidence to support non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to prevent neuritis after RFA, and in most cases anticoagulation does not require cessation in the periprocedural perioid. With an aggressive lesioning strategy, sensory stimulation provides minimal therapeutic benefit, with weak, extrapolated evidence that motor stimulation can provide safety benefit. The cutoff to designate diagnostic or prognostic blocks as positive is most commonly set at 50%, with higher values not shown to improve outcomes for more definitive procedures; for therapeutic treatment outcomes, the evidence supports a lower threshold of \u226530% pain relief or meaningful benefit on non-pain outcomes (eg, opioid cessation) for designation of a positive response. For carefully selected patients with intra-articular SIJ complex pain based on controlled blocks who have failed conservative therapies, there is weak or very weak evidence that minimally invasive SIJ fusion can provide benefit for at least one year.", "type": "Document"}

The SIJ itself is composed of the lateral parts of the sacrum and medial portions of the iliac bones, which form the joint space enclosed by a fibrous capsule and synovial lining. The superior and dorsal portions of the joint itself are amphiarthrodial with the sacral and iliac surfaces separated by fibrocartilage. The small antero-inferior portion of the joint is diarthrodial, more mobile, and contains hyaline cartilage on the bony articular surfaces. The SIJ is supported by an extensive network of posterior and anterior ligaments, which in combination with the joint itself, make up the SIJ complex, all of which contain nociceptors and can serve as pain generators. Data on the prevalence of SIJ complex pain vary widely, as there is no reference standard besides diagnostic injections, which are subject to false-positive and false-negative results. Nearly all diagnostic epidemiological studies evaluated intra-articular (IA) injections, which are associated with inherent diagnostic limitations related to capsular defects, structural communication with the S1 foramen, and anatomical variations presenting procedural challenges for consistent intra-articular access.,, Difficulties in diagnosis and discrepancies in prevalence rates have translated to a lack of standardization among clinical trials evaluating treatment interventions. There are very few placebo-controlled trials evaluating SIJ injections, with only one small trial (n = 10) evaluating IA injections and two small studies with less than 25 people each, by the same group of investigators, evaluating EA injections, with the longest study following blinded patients for two months., The strongest evidence may be for radiofrequency ablation (RFA), which has shown superiority over sham RFA, standard of care, exercise therapy and IA corticosteroids. However, similar to joint injections, the results of these studies vary considerably, and there is no consensus on patient selection, technique and nerves targeted, or outcome measures.,,,,,,,,,, There are discrepancies in the interpretation of the literature as well, with some reviews touting positive evidence for injections and RFA, while others have been more skeptical in their analysis.,", "type": "Document"}

Thirty stakeholder academies and societies, as well as other organizations (eg, U.S. Departments of Defense and Veteran Affairs) with a vested interest in SIJ complex interventions were identified, and formal request-for-participation and member nomination letters were sent to those organizations in August 2023. Twenty-seven organizations agreed to participate, and three invited professional societies declined to participate (Lumbar Spine Research Society, LSRS; American Society for Interventional Pain Physicians, ASIPP; and American Society of Spine Radiologists, ASSR). Organizations were asked to consider a candidate\u2019s expertise, clinical experience, academic interests, and diversity in their nomination process. Each society nominated a single representative member (See The SIJ-WG was charged with preparing guidelines on the use of IA SIJ injections, EA SIJ injections, SLBBs, sacral lateral branch radiofrequency ablation (SLBRFA), cryoablation, SIJ fusion, as well as conservative therapy that spanned the entire spectrum of care to include patient selection, optimizing accuracy, interpreting results, and risk mitigation. Questions and formats were developed by the Working Group Committee Co-Chairs (Z.L.M., R.W.H., and S.P.C.) during iterative meetings. These questions and formats were refined based on feedback by the Executive Committee (D.T., A.C., L.K., and J.V.Z.). Once unanimous consensus was achieved by the Working Group Committee Co-Chairs and Executive Committee, input was gathered from the full Working Group Committee and further refined during the initial video-conference call. The resulting final unanimous consensus version was comprised of 21 distinct questions to be addressed within the guidelines. The Working Group Committee was then divided into subcommittees composed of four to five members responsible for developing the answer(s) to each of the final 21 questions. One or two persons were designated as the \u201cleads\u201d responsible for task delegation. Once a subcommittee came to unanimous consensus on the answer to their assigned question, including the grade of evidence associated with relevant statements and recommendations, the Working Group Co-Chairs assisted with editing and provided feedback regarding content. Through iterative discussion of the supporting evidence, unanimous consensus was achieved amongst the subcommittee members and the Working Group Co-Chairs with regard to the content of the answer and the corresponding statements and recommendations. Next, the subcommittee\u2019s work product was sent to the entire Working Group Committee for open-forum comments and revisions. A modified Delphi method was used to tabulate comments, incorporate changes, and converge the answers toward consensus over rounds of teleconference or electronic correspondence. At the initial conference call, the Working Group Committee decided that >50% panel agreement was sufficient to report a statement or recommendation, but \u226575% agreement was required for consensus, consistent with the Lumbar Facet Intervention and Cervical Facet Intervention Guidelines.,, Search engines used during composition of the various sections included PubMed, Embase, Medline, Google Scholar, SCOPUS, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, in addition to examination of the reference sections of all manuscripts. Additional peer-reviewed articles were identified by searching in topically-related new journals that are not yet indexed by Science Citation Index or found within PubMed. There were no limitations on language or types of articles used to develop the guidelines, such that experimental studies were considered for the sections on physical exam, anatomy and technical parameters, and case reports were considered for sections pertaining to risk mitigation and complications. Keywords used to address guideline topics were tailored to individual questions and included, for example, \u201csacroiliac\u201d, \u201clateral branch\u201d, \u201cradiofrequency\u201d, \u201cpulsed radiofrequency\u201d, \u201cdenervation\u201d, \u201cablation\u201d, and \u201carthritis\u201d for questions pertaining to radiofrequency. Searches were comprehensive but a formal systematic review was outside of the scope of the charter. Literature searches were performed through March 2025 to capture topical studies published following initial searches.

In a 2020 study of individuals with lumbar disc herniations, the prevalence of SIJ dysfunction was estimated to be 33% based on three or more positive provocation tests, suggesting that SIJ pain may be present in one-third of individuals with lumbar radicular pain and MRI findings consistent with disc herniation.", "type": "Document"}

What is the prevalence of sacroiliac joint complex pain in individuals with chronic low back pain? > Dorsal ligament pain\nThe long dorsal sacroiliac ligament is anatomically connected to the erector spinae muscle, thoracolumbar fascia, and sacrotuberous ligament, potentially serving as a source of spinal pain. To date, no published studies provide an accurate estimation of the prevalence of pain exclusively from the dorsal ligament or the coexistence of dorsal ligament and IA SIJ pain, as per the theoretical framework described above. A study conducted by Salman et al. compared the effectiveness of SIJ injection to L4-5 dorsal rami and S1-3 RFA. However, little information regarding prevalence can be extrapolated from this study due to the fact that response to RFA, which is not 100% effective, cannot be used to estimate the prevalence of SIJ dorsal ligament pain, just as the response to an IA steroid injection cannot be used to estimate IA SIJ pain. Moreover, patients in both groups were selected based on response to a high-volume (3 mL) IA SIJ block, which theoretically should not relieve purely IA joint pain. Additionally, data were not presented for patients who transitioned to the RFA group. Cohen et al. performed a randomized study in 125 patients with clinically suspected SIJ complex pain in which patients were allocated to fluoroscopically-guided or landmark-guided injections. Among the 60 patients in whom the 3 mL injection with local anesthetic and corticosteroid was limited to the EA dorsal ligaments, 57% experienced at least 50% pain relief lasting over 3 h vs 62% in those in for whom the injection was IA, and 69% in patients for whom injections were both IA and EA. Flaws in this study include the use of corticosteroids during uncontrolled single injections, and landmark-guided injections targeted to the area of maximal pain and tenderness rather distributed throughout the dorsal ligaments.", "type": "Document"}

What is the prevalence of sacroiliac joint complex pain in individuals with chronic low back pain? > Sacroiliac joint complex pain following lumbar or lumbosacral fusion surgery\nPrior lumbar fusion may increase angular motion and stress across the SIJ complex, and pain may also result from adjacent level disease, increasing the prevalence of SIJ complex pain in individuals who have undergone prior spine surgery., In a computer simulation of a SIJ using a spine-pelvis model, the angular motion of the SIJ was modeled following L4-5, L4-S1, and L5-S1 fusion. The investigators found that motion increased steadily with each additional level fused and were especially substantial after an L5-S1 fusion (52% increased motion with flexion, 40% increase with extension, 28% increase with bending, and 51% increase with rotation). The most substantial increase in motion was observed with L4-S1 spinal fusion, with an estimated 168% increase in motion with flexion, 132% increase with extension, 95% increase with bending, and 69% increase with rotation., Lumbosacral spinal fusion may also result in violation of both the synovial and ligamentous portions of the SIJ. In a CT study performed in 22 patients who underwent posterior iliac crest bone grafting and experienced persistent donor site pain, 16 were found to have violation of the posterior ligamentous structures, and three exhibited disruptions of the SIJ synovium. On imaging performed at least two years post-procedure, 10 of the 16 patients with ligamentous disruption had mild degeneration and six had severe degeneration vs 0 of 5 joints in patients who experienced no ligamentous or synovial violation. In the three patients who experienced synovial membrane breach, all experienced severe SIJ degeneration. Kennedy et al. described several studies evaluating SIJ pathology in individuals who have undergone lumbar/lumbosacral spinal fusion. One retrospective study using a threshold of >75% relief of index pain after a single injection of local anesthetic and corticosteroid under fluoroscopic guidance confirmed by contrast dye reported a positive rate of 59% (20 out of 34 patients) in individuals with a spinal fusion to the sacrum. In a prospective study using local anesthetic IA SIJ injections in individuals with persistent LBP following successful lumbar spinal fusion, 35% of study participants experienced at least 75% relief from a single injection. Summary: The prevalence of SIJ-mediated chronic LBP is estimated to be 15%-30% in patients with axial pain predominantly below L5; Grade B evidence, moderate level of certainty.The prevalence of dorsal ligament-mediated pain is unknown but based on studies comparing IA and EA SIJ injection response, appears to be at least as common as exclusively IA pain; Grade I evidence.The prevalence of SIJ complex pain is suspected to be higher in patients with a prior history of lumbar or lumbosacral spinal fusion with estimated prevalence rates between 33% and 59%; Grade C evidence, low level of certainty.Chronic LBP following lumbar or lumbosacral spinal fusion surgery can be related to adjacent segment stress with increased loading and/or shear forces leading to accelerated degeneration, superimposed or missed SIJ-mediated pain prior to lumbar fusion, and/or violation of ligaments or synovial lining during iliac crest bone grafting; Grade C evidence, low level of certainty. Recommendation: Further studies are needed to assess the prevalence of primarily dorsal ligament-mediated pain based on EA injections and SLBBs.", "type": "Document"}

Can history and physical exam identify a painful sacroiliac joint and can history and physical distinguish articular sacroiliac joint pain from dorsal ligament pain?\nWhen assessing pain originating from the SIJ complex, it is important to distinguish between IA pain and dorsal ligament pain, as the treatments may differ (eg, IA injections and fusion for IA pain, EA injections and RFA for dorsal ligament pain). Some studies have identified historical and physical exam features that may help identify patients who will respond to IA diagnostic or therapeutic injections. However, no study has been designed using methodology that assesses the relative predictive value of elements of history and/or physical exam that help distinguish between IA SIJ vs dorsal ligament sources of SIJ complex pain. Since there are numerous parts of the SIJ complex that can be pain generators (eg, upper, middle, lower, dorsal and ventral ligaments, bony surfaces, synovial lining and fibrous capsule) with differences in referral patterns based on structure, location and stimulus intensity, the presentation of SIJ complex pain tends to be more variable than for individual facet joints, discs or muscles.", "type": "Document"}

Comparing SIJ IA responders vs non-responders, van der Wurff et al. found no major differences except 10% of the responders vs 100% of the non-responders had ischial tuberosity pain., Characteristic painful activities and mechanisms of injury have been suggested as variables that may help distinguish different pain generators within the SIJ complex. In one retrospective cohort study, the authors identified several historical features that correlated with response to a therapeutic IA SIJ injection with local anesthetic and corticosteroid. These features were vehicle accidents, falls onto the buttock(s), postpartum state, American football injuries, and pelvis fracture. Features that are negative predictors for SIJ complex pain have also been described. In one study, only 4.4% of individuals with a positive diagnostic response to SIJ IA indicated that they had pain above L5 on a pain diagram that they completed at the time of baseline evaluation.,, Inflammatory arthritis represents a distinct variant of IA SIJ disease, being especially common in ankylosing spondyloarthropathy and to a lesser degree rheumatoid arthritis.

In a systematic review published in 2000 examining 11 studies that assessed inter- and intra-rater reliability for sacroiliac joint examination findings, van der Wurff et al. demonstrated poor reliability for joint mobility tests and inconsistent results for pain provocation tests, with an inverse relationship observed between study methodological quality and correlation coefficients.

These injections can also predict responses to more definitive interventions, such as surgical joint fusion or SLBRFA. There are no studies evaluating the predictive value of SIJ injections before fusion, but for lumbar fusion, the results are decidedly mixed, with discography rarely used nowadays to select patients., RFA of the nerves supplying the SIJ complex targets the innervation to the posterior sacroiliac ligaments and posterior aspect of the SIJ. Hence, inadvertent EA spread during an intended IA injection that results in analgesic benefit may be more predictive of the analgesic benefit following RFA of the posterior SIJ complex innervation, though it would be impossible to separate the contributions of IA and EA spread.

Defects in the capsule of the SIJ can result in the spread of the injectate to neural and other pain-generating structures through the following pathways: (1) dorsal spread to the first three dorsal sacral foramina, (2) superior spread to the fifth lumbar nerve root, and (3) ventral spread to the lumbosacral plexus. Various patterns of neural spread were observed in over 60% of joints injected with contrast by Fortin et al. It is difficult to interpret these findings because while capsular tears may raise the likelihood of an SIJ being painful, they can also result in false-positive responses to IA diagnostic injections with LA. Presence of sensorimotor neural blockade in the ipsilateral lower limb following IA SIJ injection of LA suggests spread of LA to the lumbosacral plexus through a tear in the ventral capsule of the SIJ. However, absence of this finding cannot rule out spread to neural structures adjacent to the joint. Summary: IA injections into the SIJ should be performed with a maximum of 2.5 mL of total injectate to prevent capsular rupture and to reduce spread to adjacent structures; if an increase in resistance to the injection is perceived at lower volumes (eg, 2.0 mL), the injection may be halted to avoid tears in the capsule of the joint; Grade B recommendation, moderate level of certainty.In patients with suspected IA and EA pain arising from the SIJ itself and the ligaments overlying the posterior aspect of the joint, a total injectate volume higher than 2 mL may be required to block pain generators and treat dysfunction. Up to and sometimes exceeding 3 mL (depending on the extent of pain and pathology) of injectate can be used to achieve this goal; Grade C recommendation, low level of certainty.The response to diagnostic IA SIJ injections can be used to select patients for surgical fusion of the SIJ; Grade B recommendation, moderate level of certainty.The addition of corticosteroids to LA for IA SIJ injections for diagnosing pain arising from the SIJ does not confer any clear diagnostic benefit while potentially increasing the volume of injectate, thereby increasing the chance of extra-articular spread. Corticosteroids should not be routinely added to LA during purely diagnostic IA injections; Grade D recommendation against the intervention; low level of certainty.The volume of LA for SLBBs should range between 0.67 and 1.2 mL per foraminal region to account for variable neuroanatomy and for the possibility of multiple nerves per level, and should be performed at different depths; Grade C recommendation, very low level of certainty.", "type": "Document"}

Summary: For diagnostic SIJ injections and prognostic sacral lateral branch injections, the routine use of sedation is not recommended as it may result in a higher proportion of false-positive diagnostic injections; Grade B recommendation, low-to-moderate level of certainty.For therapeutic SIJ injections, the routine use of sedation is not recommended; occasionally, light or moderate sedation by properly trained personnel, in extenuating circumstances such as with severe needle phobias, other psychiatric indications, a history of severe vasovagal reactions, or movement disorders that preclude a safe and/or accurate injection, may be necessary; Grade C recommendation, low level of certainty.For SLBRFA, the use of light or occasionally moderate sedation with patients remaining responsive may be indicated in certain cases and should depend on patient and provider preferences; Grade C recommendation, low level of certainty.If sedation is used, the lowest dose of short-acting medications should be administered; Grade A recommendation, high level of certainty.", "type": "Document"}

How effective are non-invasive treatments for sacroiliac joint complex pain? > Non-operative (conservative) treatments for sacroiliac joint pain\nNon-operative or conservative management of SIJ complex pain commonly includes a trial of analgesic and anti-inflammatory medications, physical therapy (PT) modalities, bracing, psychological therapies, acupuncture, and various other treatments. Although supported by little evidence, these treatments are frequently recommended before consideration of operative or procedural treatments. Despite the lack of medium or high-quality evidence, conservative treatments are recommended for the treatment of SIJ complex pain by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services,,,,,,de facto use of conservative management of SIJ complex pain is primarily based on the presumption that SIJ complex pain, like many musculoskeletal conditions, will improve on its own with time, and low-risk conservative measures may facilitate this. However, the typical clinical course of SIJ complex pain in the absence of formal treatment has not been reported in the literature. The rationale for a mandatory trial with conservative therapy may be a more reasonable assumption for acute than chronic SIJ complex pain in which symptoms have persisted despite time and self-care, and conservative treatments can pose a financial burden. In an RCT by Cohen et al., It must also be acknowledged that the majority of studies evaluating the effectiveness of various non-invasive treatments for sacroiliac joint complex pain did not use SIJ injections and/or SLBBs to confirm the diagnosis of SIJ complex pain. As such, a proportion of the individuals in these studies likely did not have SIJ pain given the known limitations of history, physical examination, and imaging for identifying a painful SIJ complex.", "type": "Document"}

Whereas corticosteroid injections are an effective treatment for SIJ complex pain, relief may be short-lived for some individuals.,,, Regenerative agents may contain properties that promote repair of dense fibrous tissues such as joint capsules, ligaments, and fascia. These injectates fall into one of two categories: (1) naturally occurring bioactive agents [eg, platelet rich plasma (PRP)] and/or extracellular structural components (eg, hyaluronic acid); and (2) irritating or debriding solutions that initiate endogenous repair mechanisms (eg, prolotherapy, saline).

Summary: \u226550% pain relief should be considered the cutoff for considering a diagnostic or prognostic SIJ injection to be \u201cpositive\u201d with regard to selecting patients for SLBRFA; Grade B recommendation, moderate level of certainty.For EA injections as stand-alone prognostic tools, there is insufficient evidence to designate their use, or a specific cutoff threshold, before RFA given the low-quality studies and invalid RFA techniques; Grade I evidence.Evidence is mixed for using >50% pain relief as the prognostic threshold to select patients for SIJ fusion, with two pragmatic RCTs showing effectiveness but a sham-controlled study failing to distinguish SIJ fusion from sham outcomes. Considering the invasiveness of SIJ fusion surgery, in the context of these data, dual prognostic SIJ injections without corticosteroid and with a high pain relief threshold (with documented functional improvement) are recommended to select patients for SIJ fusion; Grade I recommendation for the number of blocks and designating a specific high cutoff percentage.For prognostic procedures before lateral branch RFA, since SLBBs have greater face validity to predict outcomes than IA (and possibly EA) SIJ injections, we recommend using a 50% cutoff for SLBBs. The rationale for this is that the pain relief from RFA is generally less than from prognostic injections because of the lower specificity of the latter; Grade B recommendation, moderate level of certainty.For designating an outcome as positive when performing a therapeutic SIJ complex procedure, the most recent literature and guidance from the IMMPACT group and the FDA suggest using thresholds of \u22652 points or 30% improvement provided there are other objective measures of benefit (eg, satisfaction, improved quality of life, decreased resource utilization); Grade B evidence, moderate level of certainty.

Because it is elective, aggressive prevention of complications is paramount. Adequate data collection regarding complications and research on preventing complications is critical to establishing and maintaining patient and clinician confidence in the safety of this procedure. Data on complications from SLBRFA are usually collected and reported as part of clinical studies. Although common complications are usually self-limiting, rarer but more serious or even catastrophic complications may need to be garnered from sources such as large databases, quality and safety reports (ie, from the Food and Drug Administration) or even from autopsy reports. In theory (never before reported), and based on proximal anatomy, such complications could include rectal perforation or injury to nerves of the sacral plexus innervating the bladder or bowel. In addition to the theoretical potential for injury to the sacral plexus and rectum, SLBRFA may cause predictable complications such as RFA of other peripheral nerves, skin burns, infection, hematomata, localized neuritis, sensory disturbance at the skin due to denervation of cutaneous nerves branching from sacral lateral branches, and a localized increase in persistent pain following thermal lesioning.

Other selected publications and references were also considered. Medications could be recommended in the consensus statement if their analgesic efficacy was supported by at least one methodologically sound RCT (class I or class II) showing significant benefit relative to placebo or another relevant control group. Trials were excluded if they represented uncontrolled studies, had sample sizes of <10 patients or studied cancer NeP except for well-defined postsurgical pain syndromes (eg, postmastectomy pain syndrome) and chemotherapy-induced NeP. Trials were also excluded if they studied trigeminal or glossopharyngeal neuralgia because these conditions have their own specific medical and surgical treatments ( The current guidelines are based on quality of evidence of anal-gesic efficacy, side-effect profiles and ease of use. Medications were considered to be first line if there was high-quality evidence of efficacy (at least one class I study or two consistent class II studies \u2013 level of recommendation grade B or better) ( Target users for these guidelines are physicians, nurse practitioners and other allied health care individuals involved in the management of NeP.

Spontaneous pain is commonly described as burning or intense tightness with superimposed shooting or lancinating pain. Stimulus-evoked pain includes allodynia, defined as painful sensations in response to a normally nonpainful stimulus, and hyperalgesia, defined as increased pain sensitivity in response to a normally painful stimulus. Superimposed autonomic features, such as alterations in temperature, colour and sweating as well as the development of trophic changes, suggest a diagnosis of reflex sympathetic dystrophy or complex regional pain syndrome ( The differential diagnosis of NeP is extensive and includes central and peripheral causes. Examples of central NeP include poststroke pain (\u2018thalamic pain syndrome\u2019), pain related to multiple sclerosis and pain due to spinal cord injury. Common causes of peripheral NeP include painful diabetic neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia and surgically induced NeP, following thoracotomy, amputation, breast surgery and back surgery sometimes associated with nerve root fibrosis. The diagnosis of NeP is based primarily on the patient\u2019s history and physical examination. Postherpetic neuralgia and painful diabetic neuropathy are typically easy to diagnose when there is a history of shingles and diabetes mellitus, respectively. However, pain radiating into an extremity can be either referred myofascial pain or NeP, and these can be much more challenging to diagnose. Simple questionnaires based on sensory descriptors and sensory examination have been developed to differentiate between somatic pain and NeP. Instruments such as the Douleur Neuropathique 4 and the Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs have been shown to be valid and reliable discriminators of NeP (", "type": "Document"}

It is also important to recognize secondary treatment goals such as improving sleep, ability to function and overall quality of life. However, treatment goals must be realistic. Caregivers should validate the patient\u2019s pain to gain their trust and should set realistic treatment goals. This is typically straightforward from the caregiver\u2019s point of view because most NeP states are based on well-defined injuries to the nervous system. The primary goal in most cases is to make the pain \u2018bearable\u2019 or \u2018tolerable\u2019 \u2013 not to eliminate the pain. Such goal setting can make a considerable difference in patient satisfaction when pharmacological treatments are instituted. Due to the lack of head-to-head trials to guide treatment choices, one approach to estimate the relative efficacy of analgesic agents in RCTs is to use the number needed to treat (NNT) \u2013 the number of patients that need to be treated with a certain drug to provide one additional patient with at least 50% pain relief relative to the comparator group. The NNT is used to estimate treatment efficacy, recognizing that there are limitations to this methodology including variability in RCTs (eg, crossover versus parallel design) and the short-term nature of most RCTs. Another approach to estimate efficacy is to determine the effect size \u2013 defined as the mean difference between active agent and placebo divided by the SD.

TCAs have the advantage of low cost and once-daily dosing, but can produce drowsiness and significant anticholinergic side effects, including dry mouth, constipation and urinary retention, and are, thus, poorly tolerated in the elderly. Secondary amine TCAs (nortriptyline and desipramine) are better tolerated than tertiary amine TCAs (amitriptyline and imipramine) with comparable analgesic efficacy ( Gabapentin and pregabalin appear to be similar in their mechanisms of action and side-effect profiles, and allow for more rapid titration than antidepressant agents. Pregabalin carries the advantage of twice-daily dosing and linear pharmacokinetics relative to gabapentin. Gabapentinoids in general have few drug interactions, but are dependent on renal excretion and, therefore, require dosage reductions in patients with renal insufficiency ( If a TCA fails or is contraindicated, the use of a gabapentinoid or an SNRI, such as duloxetine, should be considered. If one of the latter agents provides only partial pain relief, it is reasonable to add the other agent because there is evidence that combination pharmacotherapy can be helpful ( When first-line medications fail or provide inadequate pain relief, tramadol or a conventional opioid analgesic may be useful as a second-line treatment. It is also reasonable to consider a short-acting opioid, such as codeine or oxycodone (sometimes combined with acetaminophen), for breakthrough pain during titration of a first-line agent if needed for severe pain. Controlled-release opioid analgesics are considered to be second-line agents in the management of NeP because of their extensive side-effect profile and the risk of opioid misuse, abuse and addiction leading to cautionary prescribing and monitoring. A recent meta-analysis of 62 RCTs found that the most common adverse effects associated with opioids were nausea (28%), constipation (25%), drowsiness (24%), dizziness (18%) and vomiting (15%) ( The cannabinoids have now advanced to third-line agents in the management of chronic NeP based on increasing evidence of efficacy in multiple pain models including HIV neuropathy, post-traumatic and postsurgical NeP, painful diabetic neuropathy and spinal cord injury pain ( Fourth-line agents in the management of NeP include methadone, tapentadol and anticonvulsants, with lesser evidence of efficacy such as lacosamide, lamotrigine and topiramate. Topical lidocaine has been relegated to fourth-line status because of conflicting evidence of efficacy except in the management of postherpetic neuralgia, for which it remains a second-line option. It is more challenging to provide a stepwise systematic approach to the management of central NeP because of the relative paucity of high-quality studies and conflicting evidence of efficacy.

It can either occur as a direct or as an indirect consequence of SCI and it often heavily influences the quality of life of affected individuals. In SCI, nociceptive and neuropathic pain can equally emerge at the same time above or below the level of injury. Thus, classification and grading of pain is frequently difficult. Effective treatment of SCI-related pain in general and of neuropathic pain in particular is challenging. Current treatment options are sparse and their evidence is considered to be limited. Considering these aspects, a clinical practice guideline was developed as basis for an optimized, comprehensive and standardized pain management in SCI-related pain.Methods: The German-Speaking Medical Society for Spinal Cord Injury (Deutschsprachige Medizinische Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Paraplegiologie \u2013 DMGP) developed a clinical practice guideline that received consensus from seven further German-speaking medical societies and one patient organization. The evidence base from clinical trials and meta-analyses was summarized and subjected to a structured consensus-process in accordance with the regulations of the Association of Scientific Medical Societies in Germany (AWMF) and the methodological requirements of the \u201cGerman instrument for methodological guideline appraisal\u201d.Results: This consensus-based guideline (S2k classification according to the AWMF guidance manual and rules) resulted in seven on-topic statements and 17 specific recommendations relevant to the classification, assessment and therapy of pain directly or indirectly caused by SCI. Recommended therapeutic approaches comprise pharmacological (e.g. nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or anticonvulsants) and non-pharmacological (e.g. physical activity or psychotherapeutic techniques) strategies for both nociceptive and neuropathic pain.Discussion: Assessment of SCI-related pain is standardized and respective methods in terms of examination, classification and grading of pain are already in use and validated in German language. In contrast, valid, evidence-based and efficient therapeutic options are limited and ask for further clinical studies, ideally randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses.", "type": "Document"}

Neither the severity of SCI, nor the NLI are proven to have influence on the emergence of distinct pain types or the intensity of perceived pain [ Concerning the efficient treatment of SCI-related pain, there are two meta-analyses on pharmacotherapy in general and one on gabapentinoids in particular, one on a surgical intervention (DREZ lesion) and one on physical or behavioral treatment [ All these evident specifics and challenges emphasize the need of a systematic and structured approach for pain management in SCI, such as clinical practice guidelines. Accordingly, the primary goal of this clinical practice guideline is to establish and standardize a broadly approved and recognized concept to address the frequent challenges regarding the management of SCI-related pain syndromes in German-speaking countries. This in turn will likely improve health care in affected SCI individuals and represents a basis to develop more effective therapeutic options in the future. This guideline addresses physicians and therapists of all participating medical societies and specialist disciplines (e.g. neurologists, physiatrists, pain specialists, orthopedists, psychotherapists). It should serve as a source of information for all further professional fields that are involved in the treatment of adult individuals with acute and chronic spinal cord injury in out- and inpatient setting.", "type": "Document"}

Thereafter, the drafts were combined to a first preliminary version of the guideline, which again went through a review process, firstly within the steering committee. Within this process, all committee members were required to screen existing evidence/literature, available international guidelines and relevant recommendations of international societies. In addition, committee members contributed their own reasoned expert opinion. The structured process of consensus building within the whole guideline panel was initiated after the conclusion of the steering committees\u2019 review process. Representatives of each aforementioned society/association and members of the steering committee were asked to comment and edit the guideline as appropriate (1st and 2nd revision within the guideline panel). In each of the two rounds, the steering committee prepared a revised version of the guideline for re-submission to the group. Subsequently, the coordinator of the consensus-building process analyzed the preliminary guideline in terms of core statements and grading of recommendations. The core statements and recommendations were then summarized to be voted upon (3rd and 4th revision within the guideline panel). All members of the guideline panel were required to judge about every single item. In case of dissent, each member had to either justify the decision or to provide alternative suggestions. Whenever possible, a dissent needed to be supported by relevant published evidence. Suggestions were submitted to the guideline panel along with a commented revised draft of the guideline, which was previously prepared by the steering committee. All members were asked to decide about the revised proposals and to comment on the suggestions of the steering committee if necessary. This procedure was iterated until a unanimous consent was achieved. Throughout the process of guideline development, all group members were called upon to check for recently published or by then missed literature and evidence, respectively. Furthermore, throughout the guideline development emerging expert statements in the context of pain treatment could be incorporated if relevant.

Given the frequent recurrence and the chronic disease course as a consequence of SCI, practitioners should take care of a comprehensive and accurate documentation of all emerging pain aspects and causalities (e.g. ICD-10 codes), to guarantee an adequate and sufficient supply of medication, as well as any other means/therapies to treat SCI-related pain (see statement 6.3), and to avoid recourse claims from health insurance funds.

The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the available literature on this topic and develop recommendations for optimal pain management after oncological breast surgery. A systematic review using preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta\u2010analysis guidance with procedure\u2010specific postoperative pain management (PROSPECT) methodology was undertaken. Randomised controlled trials assessing postoperative pain using analgesic, anaesthetic or surgical interventions were identified. Seven hundred and forty\u2010nine studies were found, of which 53 randomised controlled trials and nine meta\u2010analyses met the inclusion criteria and were included in this review. Quantitative analysis suggests that dexamethasone and gabapentin reduced postoperative pain. The use of paravertebral blocks also reduced postoperative pain scores, analgesia consumption and the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting. Intra\u2010operative opioid requirements were documented to be lower when a pectoral nerves block was performed, which also reduced postoperative pain scores and opioid consumption. We recommend basic analgesics (i.e. paracetamol and non\u2010steroidal anti\u2010inflammatory drugs) administered pre\u2010operatively or intra\u2010operatively and continued postoperatively. In addition, pre\u2010operative gabapentin and dexamethasone are also recommended. In major breast surgery, a regional anaesthetic technique such as paravertebral block or pectoral nerves block and/or local anaesthetic wound infiltration may be considered for additional pain relief. Paravertebral block may be continued postoperatively using catheter techniques. Opioids should be reserved as rescue analgesics in the postoperative period. Research is needed to evaluate the role of novel regional analgesic techniques such as erector spinae plane or retrolaminar plane blocks combined with basic analgesics in an enhanced recovery setting.", "type": "Document"}

All but three studies showed statistically significant results for the intervention tested. Based on the PROSPECT approach, basic analgesia including the combination of paracetamol and conventional NSAIDs or COX\u20102\u2010selective inhibitors should be administered pre\u2010operatively or intra\u2010operatively and continued into the postoperative period, unless there are contraindications (Table Pre\u2010operative gabapentin is recommended as it has been shown to reduce postoperative pain scores and opioid consumption. However, a wide range of doses were administered in different clinical trials without any documented dose\u2013response effect. Surprisingly, the well\u2010documented side\u2010effects of gabapentinoids, such as dizziness, blurred vision or sedation, were not reported in the studies dedicated to postoperative analgesia after breast surgery, even in patients receiving high doses. Overall, gabapentin is recommended but with caution, as high doses may induce side\u2010effects that could be especially concerning in ambulatory patients Local anaesthetic wound infiltration should be considered in patients scheduled for minor\u2010to\u2010moderately invasive surgical procedures (e.g. lumpectomy and partial mastectomy), although it provides postoperative analgesia of a limited duration. Postoperative pain after these procedures is typically mild\u2010to\u2010moderate and the intensity decreases over the first couple of postoperative days. Paravertebral blocks should be considered for major breast surgery (e.g. mastectomy with or without axillary node dissection). Studies demonstrated that this intervention was associated with: lower postoperative pain scores; lower systemic analgesia consumption; reduced postoperative nausea and vomiting; and a shorter length of hospital stay than general anaesthesia alone, although the studies did not follow an enhanced recovery programme. A single\u2010injection paravertebral block requires a shorter time to perform and is less labour intensive as compared with the multiple\u2010injection technique or placement of a paravertebral catheter. Some studies report an improvement in functional outcomes and less severe chronic pain after the use of continuous paravertebral block. These findings should be interpreted with caution as these studies did not use \u2018basic\u2019 simple non\u2010opioid analgesics (i.e. paracetamol, NSAIDs or COX\u20102 selective inhibitors) in a fully implemented multimodal analgesia programme. Not surprisingly, a cost effectiveness study reported higher costs of continuous paravertebral block Interfascial plane bocks such as the retrolaminar block or erector spinae plane block have been recently described and could potentially provide an alternative to paravertebral block. However, retrolaminar block has only been studied in one RCT in the context of breast surgery Our search did not find evidence regarding the choice of surgical technique that could prevent or reduce pain after breast surgery. There is a need for further study. The limitations of this review are related to those of the included studies. There was considerable heterogeneity between studies such as: variable dosing regimens; variable methods of administration; a difference in the baseline analgesic management of control groups; and variable time\u2010points of pain measurement. The sample sizes of most studies were small and therefore it is hard to draw firm conclusions regarding the side\u2010effect profile of many proposed interventions. Future adequately powered studies should assess the effects of analgesic interventions not only on pain, opioid consumption, opioid\u2010related adverse events and complications associated with the intervention but also outcome measures such as: time to ambulation; length of hospital stay; occurrence of opioid dependence; and patient\u2010centred outcomes such as patient satisfaction or quality of recovery. In summary, this review has identified analgesic regimens for optimal pain management after breast surgery (Table\n", "type": "Document"}

In December 2017, the preliminary draft document was sent to the American Society of Anesthesiologists' (ASA's) Committees on Pain Medicine, and Standards and Practice Parameters, which approved the document with minor revisions. The Ketamine Guidelines Committee was asked to develop guidelines that could be used by institutions, regulatory bodies and third-party payers, and practitioners to develop protocols, guide decision making, and improve patient outcomes and safety. The committee identified the need for distinct ketamine guidelines for acute and chronic pain in December 2016 during its first conference call. Panel members were selected by the 2 organizations and the chairperson of the Consensus Guidelines Committee on Ketamine for Pain Management (S.P.C.) based on their expertise in the use of ketamine, development of protocols to regulate its use, and ability to critically evaluate the literature. The questions and answers that comprised the guidelines were divided into modules composed of 3 to 5 authors and the committee chair, with 1 panel member designated as lead. The 6 questions were selected by the committee chair, revised by the acute guideline's first author (E.S.S.), and further modified by the committee en bloc. The author modules developed answers to the questions, with the chair and his designee(s) resolving discrepancies. All manuscript sections were then reviewed by the entire committee and revised by consensus. We intended to consider agreement by more than 75% of committee members as a consensus, noting the specific dissensions and reasons why, but were able to reach complete agreement on all questions.

In the case of subanesthetic ketamine in the acute pain setting, patients who benefit most fall into several broad categories. The first group of patients are those undergoing surgery in which the expected postoperative pain will be severe. This includes upper abdominal and thoracic surgery, where the greatest benefit in opioid reduction has been reported, as well as lower abdominal, intra-abdominal, and orthopedic (limb and spine) procedures. Patients undergoing procedures with expected mild levels of pain, such as tonsillectomy and head and neck surgery, have not been shown to benefit from perioperative ketamine. Another group of patients who may be considered for acute ketamine therapy are those who are opioid tolerant or opioid dependent and presenting for surgery or those with an acute exacerbation of a chronic condition. Although ketamine is widely used in this patient population, evidence for opioid-dependent patients specifically is limited to a few randomized controlled trials (RCTs). One RCT by Loftus and colleagues in 102 opioid-dependent patients undergoing major spine surgery showed reduced 48-hour opioid consumption as well as opioid usage at 6 weeks in patients who received intraoperative ketamine only. Other studies in the same patient population have been less impressive or shown no benefit; however, those 3 studies collectively enrolled only slighter more patients (N = 122) than did Loftus et al (N = 102). Another RCT of opioid-dependent patients who were undergoing several types of noncancer surgery, primarily spine surgery, reported lower pain ratings in the ketamine group but no change in opioid consumption. Taken together, the studies suggest at least mild benefit for ketamine in the opioid-tolerant population, and the committee strongly believes this benefit may be moderate. Opioid-dependent nonsurgical patients might benefit from ketamine during acute exacerbations of chronic pain conditions. In patients with sickle cell disease, several case reports suggest that ketamine improves analgesia in adults as well as children. In one of these cases, a patient was taking close to 5000 mg of daily oral morphine equivalents, and after 30 days in the hospital with poorly controlled pain (pain ratings were 7\u201310 out of 10), he was able to have his pain controlled with a 7-day ketamine infusion (discharge pain rating was 6 out of 10 in the hip and 4 out of 10 in all other joints). However, no RCTs have examined ketamine use in this context. Other acute pain conditions outside the perioperative setting in which ketamine has anecdotally been reported to be effective include postendoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography pancreatitis pain, renal colic, and exacerbation of central pain from Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. The last subset of patients for whom ketamine may be beneficial is those who are at increased risk for opioid-related respiratory depression, such as those with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Opioids increase the severity of OSA syndrome after surgery, and agents that can help limit opioid consumption are desirable. Although subanesthetic ketamine has clearly been shown to reduce postoperative opioid consumption, its effect on the incidence of respiratory depression is less clear because most studies have not specifically addressed this. High-level evidence is lacking for ketamine in the sleep apnea population. Overall, we conclude that subanesthetic ketamine infusions should be considered for patients undergoing painful surgery (grade B recommendation, moderate level of certainty). Ketamine may be considered for opioid-dependent or opioid-tolerant patients undergoing surgery (grade B recommendation, low level of certainty). Because evidence is limited to case reports and series as well as the clinical experience of the committee, ketamine may be considered for opioid-dependent or opioid-tolerant patients with acute or chronic sickle cell pain (grade C recommendation, low level of certainty). For patients with sleep apnea, ketamine may be considered as an adjunct to limit opioids (grade C recommendation, low level of certainty).", "type": "Document"}

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) prescribing information lists the anesthetic induction dose as ranging from 1 to 4.5 mg/kg, noting that the average dose is 2 mg/kg. The FDA monograph on ketamine also states that it is indicated as a sole anesthetic agent for surgical procedures that do not require muscle relaxation. Ketamine produces analgesia at plasma concentrations of 100 to 200 ng/mL, which represent a small fraction of plasma concentrations after general anesthesia doses (9000\u201325,000 ng/mL). The common subanesthetic dose of ketamine used in clinical practice is intravenous (IV) 0.3- to 0.5-mg/kg bolus, with or without an infusion (usually started at 0.1\u20130.2 mg/kg per hour) depending on the duration of analgesic response required for a patient. In the placebo-controlled trial by Loftus and colleagues, the authors administered a preincision bolus of 0.5 mg/kg followed by an intraoperative ketamine infusion of 0.6 mg/kg per hour until emergence to 52 opioid-tolerant patients undergoing back surgery. Compared with placebo, they were able to demonstrate an analgesic effect and decrease in opioid consumption for up to 6 weeks postoperatively. Reductions in opioid consumption have been demonstrated in mechanically ventilated, surgical intensive care patients on opioid infusions when ketamine was initiated at a low-dose continuous infusion rate of 0.06 to 0.30 mg/kg per hour. However, in a recent small study of 48 pediatric patients undergoing scoliosis spine surgery, a subanesthetic ketamine dose of 0.5 mg/kg followed by an infusion at 0.12 mg/kg per hour for 72 hours yielded no significant differences in opioid consumption or pain scores compared with placebo. In a longitudinal cohort study performed in 230 children, adolescents, and young adults, patients with acute (78%) and chronic (22%) pain were given different doses of ketamine infusions depending on whether they were opioid tolerant. Opioid-naive patients were administered ketamine infusions of 0.05 to 0.4 mg/kg per hour, opioid-tolerant patients received dosages ranging from 0.05 to 1 mg/kg per hour, and those with documented opioid-induced hyperalgesia underwent infusion rates of 1 mg/kg per hour. A significant reduction in pain scores with minimal adverse events (AEs) was observed starting from the day of infusion up to the day after cessation of treatment. Fifty-two percent of patients were able to reduce their opioid consumption by at least 20%. Factors associated with greater benefit included longer duration of infusion, cancer-related pain, and acute inflammatory conditions (eg, pancreatitis). In a case report and review of the literature by Uprety et al, the authors found that 83.3% of 18 patients with sickle cell crises experienced significant pain improvement and reduction in opioid usage with subanesthetic ketamine. Doses were not provided. Three people were reported to experience adverse effects, with one requiring discontinuation. Finally, in a meta-analysis of 14 randomized trials totaling 649 patients, Pendi et al found that subanesthetic ketamine was associated with lower pain scores and less postoperative morphine consumption for up 24 hours following spine surgery, with no difference in the rate of AEs. Ketamine bolus doses ranged from 0.15 to 10 mg/kg, and infusion rates ranged from 0.06 to 5.0 mg/kg per hour. The analgesic effects induced by subanesthetic ketamine are reflected by objective measures, such as functional imaging. In a study performed in 8 volunteers subjected to noxious thermal stimuli, Rogers et al found that a subanesthetic infusion of ketamine (0.71 mg/kg per hour) significantly reduced pain scores compared with a saline infusion and subanalgesic dosage and was accompanied by a decrease in activity in brain regions that activate in response to noxious stimuli (the insular cortex and thalamus), as shown on functional magnetic resonance imaging. The subanalgesic dose (0.18 mg/kg per hour) resulted in no significant decrease in pain scores compared with placebo and smaller, nonsignificant changes in brain activity. In a similar functional imaging study performed in 12 male volunteers, subanesthetic doses of ketamine (20 mg/70 kg over the first hour followed by 40 mg/70 kg over the next hour) resulted in a 46.9% decrease in pain scores in response to heat stimuli compared with placebo. An increase in connectivity was noted in the cerebellum and visual cortex, whereas decreased connectivity was observed in the auditory network and somatosensory regions responsible for pain perception and the affective processing of pain, including the amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate cortex. In summary, the ketamine anesthetic induction dosage range has wide variability, particularly at the lower end of the spectrum around 1 mg/kg. However, it is clear that dosages below the anesthetic range can render patients at risk of aspiration as well as other adverse sequelae, including cardiovascular and psychomimetic effects. Reducing the infusion rate may decrease the incidence of such adverse effects. Therefore, nil per os and other precautions should be implemented on a case-by-case basis at the provider's discretion. In addition, clinicians who are overseeing the administration of ketamine in acute pain settings should be trained in airway management and Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS). This recommendation mirrors that of the Consensus Guidelines on the Use of Intravenous Ketamine Infusions for Chronic Pain from ASRA, AAPM, and ASA. The dosing range that is considered subanesthetic is not consistently defined in the literature, with one review setting the cutoff at <1.2 mg/kg/h. In addition, few acute pain studies have directly compared different doses. However, the majority of acute pain studies used bolus doses of less than 0.5 mg/kg and infusion rates of less than 0.5 mg/kg per hour (8 \u03bcg/kg per minute). The large majority of the protocols we examined, including those at the authors' institutions, specified that infusion rates are not to exceed 1 mg/kg per hour (16.67 \u03bcg/kg per minute) except in rare circumstances on a case-by-case basis. Therefore, we recommend that ketamine bolus doses do not exceed 0.35 mg/kg, and infusions for acute pain generally do not exceed 1 mg/kg per hour in settings without intensive monitoring, but we also acknowledge that individual pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic differences, as well as other factors (eg, prior ketamine exposure), may warrant dosing outside this range. Ketamine's adverse effects will prevent some patients from tolerating higher doses in acute pain settings, and unlike for chronic pain therapy, lower doses (ie, 0.1\u20130.5 mg/kg per hour) may be needed to achieve an adequate balance of analgesia and adverse effects (grade C recommendation, moderate level of certainty).", "type": "Document"}

However, opioid tolerance, adverse effects, contraindications, or a combination of those factors may prevent or limit the use of 1 or more components of the multimodal regimen. Although ketamine is clearly a potent analgesic, this question deals with how effective it is when added to a multimodal analgesia regimen in the perioperative period. In other words, what benefit does ketamine confer to analgesia when a standard regimen of opioids and other medications is already being used? The effect of administering subanesthetic doses of ketamine (defined in 1 review as a bolus dose of \u22641 mg/kg when administered via an IV route and/or an IV infusion rate of \u22641.2 mg/kg per hour or 20 \u03bcg/kg per minute) was assessed in 4 recent meta-analyses, each with at least 10 RCTs, and one that studied it as an adjunct to patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) with opioids (Table The addition of ketamine was associated with a small but significant reduction in pain scores, a moderate decrease in the requirement of opioids in all 4 meta-analyses, and a lower incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting during the initial postoperative period in 3 of the reviews. None of the 4 meta-analyses reported increased sedation with use of ketamine, and only one found an increase in neuropsychiatric adverse effects of ketamine (eg, hallucinations, nightmares). In an RCT comparing morphine PCA using a 1.5-mg demand dose to a demand dose containing 1 mg of morphine and 5 mg of ketamine in 41 postthoracotomy patients, the group who received subanesthetic ketamine experienced comparable pain control with fewer adverse effects and a 45% reduction in morphine consumption. A retrospective study of ketamine infusions that included 321 surgical and nonsurgical patients reported an incidence of 16.2% for neuropsychiatric AEs, but the study had no control group, and the authors could not be certain that all events were attributable to ketamine rather than other medications. The institutional protocol at this hospital had an upper dosing limit of 1 mg/kg per hour. Convincing evidence is lacking to support a specific subanesthetic IV loading dose or infusion dose range for IV ketamine. Commonly reported dosing regimens during the perioperative period include a bolus of IV ketamine 0.1 to 0.5 mg/kg followed by an infusion of 0.1 to 0.6 mg/kg per hour that is either discontinued at the end of surgery or continued up to the third postoperative day. Although a study that used a ketamine infusion at the lower end of the dose range (bolus of 0.15 mg/kg and infusion at 0.12 mg/kg per hour during and for 24 hours after surgery) reported no analgesic benefit in patients on opioids who had spine surgery, no published RCTs have compared different bolus and infusion doses of ketamine. Overall, we conclude that moderate evidence supports use of subanesthetic IV ketamine bolus doses (up to 0.35 mg/kg) and infusions (up to 1 mg/kg per hour) as adjuncts to opioids for perioperative analgesia (grade B recommendation, moderate level of certainty).", "type": "Document"}

In these contexts, subanesthetic doses are generally used. The major ketamine contraindications are often based on its anesthetic use at high doses and include poorly controlled cardiovascular disease and hepatic dysfunction. The available clinical studies for subanesthetic use unfortunately provide little guidance on contraindications. Most trials have enrolled generally healthy individuals without major risk factors, so the effect of low-dose ketamine in at-risk individuals is largely unknown. In addition, most trials are relatively small and are therefore unlikely to detect uncommon but serious adverse effects. Few studies comment specifically on contraindications using subanesthetic dosages for acute pain and those that do often refer to the traditional contraindications to its use as an anesthetic, such as elevated intraocular and intracranial pressure, both of which are controversial. Several RCTs have been conducted with ketamine in the perioperative setting. One excluded patients with elevated intracranial pressure, intraocular pressure, uncontrolled hypertension, history of psychosis, and pregnancy; a second excluded psychosis, pregnancy, or altered mental status; and another excluded severe cardiopulmonary disease, uncontrolled hypertension, raised intracranial pressure, glaucoma, hepatorenal dysfunction, pregnancy, and psychosis. For acute pain, poorly controlled cardiovascular disease, pregnancy, and hepatic dysfunction seem to be commonly agreed-upon relative contraindications. None of the studies, however, reported any patients who experienced major adverse cardiovascular events or hepatic dysfunction as a result of ketamine, so the clinical significance of these relative contraindications is uncertain. When comparing randomized trials for acute pain to those evaluating its use for chronic pain, similar exclusion criteria are noted. Schwartzman et al studied complex regional pain syndrome patients with ketamine infusions up to 0.35 mg/kg per hour and excluded patients with poorly controlled hypotension and hypertension, cardiac failure, renal failure, hepatic failure, glaucoma, and thyrotoxicosis. In another RCT, Sigtermans et al, who administered between 5 and 30 mg/h of ketamine over several days, excluded patients who were pregnant or had increased intracranial pressure, psychosis, or serious cardiovascular, renal, or liver disease. Of note, the dose ranges in these studies were very similar to those used in several acute pain RCTs. Most studies for acute pain provide some details on AEs. Across the studies, the most commonly reported AEs are nausea, vomiting, vivid dreams or hallucinations, and, rarely, dissociative effects. In most studies, the incidence of AEs is only slightly elevated compared with placebo or no difference. Consideration of AEs must be interpreted with caution because they are often spontaneous patient reports, not graded for severity or interrogated by validated instruments. Clinicians should exclude or limit ketamine use in patients with the commonly considered contraindications. These include severe hepatic dysfunction (eg, cirrhosis), high-risk coronary artery disease, and poorly controlled psychiatric conditions involving psychosis, such as schizophrenia. For liver disease, 1 study on complex regional pain syndrome found that a second moderate-dose ketamine infusion (around 30 mg/h) performed 3 weeks after a 100-hour initial infusion was associated with significant elevation in liver function tests that necessitated terminating the trial, and another study reported elevated liver function tests following anesthetic bolus dosages (3\u20134 mg/kg). A recent consensus statement from the American Psychiatric Association does not explicitly cite psychosis as an absolute contraindication. Although the reasons are not noted, they may include the high coprevalence rate between depression and schizophrenia and other Axis I diagnoses. A related issue is whether a patient with substance use disorder should be exposed to ketamine in an acute pain setting, given its addictive potential. The committee believes there is little to no evidence in the literature at this time that suggests that brief exposure to ketamine while in a hospitalized setting increases the chance of addiction to ketamine, and opioids may not be a viable option in individuals with an acute pain condition who have opioid use disorder and high tolerance. However, the possibility exists, and this should be assessed on a case-by-case basis. The risk assessment may differ from that for patients receiving ketamine for chronic pain, which is typically a less urgent indication. In summary, the literature provides very little guidance for the specific issue of subanesthetic ketamine contraindications in acute pain. Evidence from the large body of literature that studied ketamine as an anesthetic must be evaluated and interpreted in the context of lower doses being used with unclear dose-response relationships. All drugs, including ketamine, should be monitored on a continuous basis for safety and efficacy, weighing the risk-benefit ratio throughout treatment. With careful patient monitoring, ketamine may be used safely for acute pain despite some traditional contraindications. The committee believes that there is no evidence to suggest that the contraindications for acute pain should differ from those for ketamine used to treat chronic conditions, with the exception of the use of ketamine in active substance abusers (Grade C relative contraindication for chronic pain, not a contraindication for acute pain) and poorly controlled cardiovascular disease (Grade B relative contraindication for chronic pain, Grade C for acute pain). These differences were attributed to the more urgent nature of treating acute pain, and for substance abuse, the fact that in most cases the drug of abuse is opioids, which is the primary pharmacological alternative. One important issue not directly addressed in a guideline question relates to the necessary qualifications of the personnel who supervise or direct the administration of subanesthetic ketamine. Although doses used in the acute pain setting may be lower at times than those used in chronic pain settings, the monitoring requirements do not differ. The Consensus Guidelines on the Use of Intravenous Ketamine Infusions for Chronic Pain from ASRA, AAPM, and ASA state that \u201conly those trained in the induction and maintenance of ketamine infusions such as anesthesiologists, critical care\u2013trained physicians, and pain physicians with appropriate credentials to include training in airway management be responsible for decisions regarding administration of this medication in doses that may render a patient unresponsive. Indeed, a study of subanesthetic ketamine required that subjects be nil per os for 6 hours prior to the treatments, suggesting that aspiration precautions were deemed necessary even with subanesthetic concentrations.\u201d An appropriately trained health care provider, who should be a registered nurse with ACLS certification and additional training in the administration of moderate sedation and knowledge of ketamine pharmacology, can monitor the patient receiving ketamine infusions in subanesthetic doses and change the infusion rate based on directions from the responsible physician, who should be an anesthesiologist, intensive care physician, pain physician, or emergency medicine physician. These recommendations apply to ketamine's use in acute pain as well. Finally, treatment of adverse effects of ketamine used in the acute pain setting may be accomplished with benzodiazepines or clonidine, although few data are available to guide such therapy. The committee agrees with the recommendations made in the Consensus Guidelines on the Use of Intravenous Ketamine Infusions for Chronic Pain from ASRA, AAPM, and ASA, which state that there is \u201climited direct evidence supporting the preemptive use of benzodiazepines and alpha-2 agonists\u2026 (grade C recommendation, low level of certainty).\u201d No evidence supports the use of other classes of medications to treat adverse effects of ketamine. Evidence indicates that ketamine should be avoided in individuals with poorly controlled cardiovascular disease (grade C evidence, moderate level of certainty) and pregnancy or active psychosis (grade B evidence, moderate level of certainty). For hepatic dysfunction, evidence supports that ketamine infusions should be avoided in individuals with severe disease (eg, cirrhosis) and used with caution (ie, with monitoring of liver function tests before infusion and during infusions in surveillance of elevations) in individuals with moderate disease (grade C evidence, low level of certainty). Evidence indicates that ketamine should be avoided in individuals with elevated intracranial pressure and elevated intraocular pressure (grade C evidence, low level of certainty).

At present, no FDA-approved nonparenteral formulations exist for oral or intranasal (IN) administration. All published reports on oral or IN ketamine administration have involved off-label use of compounded products, which may carry increased risk of contamination. Several proprietary IN formulations are in development with intended psychiatric indications (primarily depression) as well as some in early development for pain, the details of which are unavailable. Whether the carriers in these as-yet unavailable products affect the delivery characteristics is unclear, so comparisons to compounded products must be viewed with caution. Until commercially approved products are available, IN administration of ketamine requires preparation by compounding pharmacies in compliance with USP-797 to ensure stability, sterility, and correct dosing. Off-label oral ketamine is poorly bioavailable (approximately 20%, although it increases significantly when the contribution of its metabolite norketamine is taken into consideration), and few studies provide guidance on dosing. In a randomized trial that included 42 patients with chronic neuropathic pain randomized to oral ketamine 30 mg 3 times per day, oral methadone 3 mg 3 times per day, or the same doses of both drugs, the ketamine group experienced greater pain relief after 3 months of therapy compared with the other groups. A recent pilot study involving 3 patients who received 0.5 to 1 mg/kg of oral ketamine 3 times per day also suggests effectiveness for acute postoperative amputation pain. Few randomized trials involve IN ketamine for acute postoperative pain. In a placebo-controlled study evaluating different doses of IN ketamine in 40 patients undergoing third molar extraction, meaningful pain relief was achieved over a 3-hour period after a single dose of ketamine 50 mg but not with 10 or 30 mg. Adverse events were generally mild and similar to the placebo group. Most other reports evaluating nonparenteral ketamine are in the emergency medicine literature. A randomized study performed on 90 subjects compared IN ketamine (1 mg/kg) to IV (0.1 mg/kg) or intramuscular (IM) morphine (0.15 mg/kg) for acute traumatic pain. The authors found that IN ketamine (56-mm maximal visual analog scale pain reduction) was associated with similar safety and analgesia to morphine administered via IV (59 mm reduction) and by the IM route (48-mm decrease). For IN ketamine (14.3 minutes) and IV morphine (8.9 minutes), the time to onset was significantly faster than that in the IM treatment group. Another randomized, double-blind trial compared single-dose IN ketamine (1 mg/kg) to IV morphine (0.1 mg/kg) in 53 patients with renal colic. In this visceral pain condition, both treatment groups appeared similar in safety and effectiveness for up to 30 minutes after drug administration. Two other observational studies that enrolled adult and pediatric patients for a variety of acute pain presentations also demonstrated analgesic effectiveness for IN ketamine, with only minor and transient AEs. In the first study, 34 children were given a 0.7-mg/kg bolus followed by an additional 0.3-mg/kg bolus if pain exceeded 50 mm on a 100-mm visual analog scale. Patients were followed up for 60 minutes. In the second study, patients were given a bolus of 0.5 to 0.75 mg/kg and followed up for 60 minutes. Finally, in a systematic review evaluating IN ketamine (dose range, 2\u201310 mg/kg) for procedural sedation and analgesia in children (7 studies, 4 involving dental procedures, enrolling 264 total patients), Poonai et al found IN ketamine to be superior to various comparators (ie, IN sufentanil, midazolam, dexmedetomidine, and placebo) being effective in 85% of cases. It should be emphasized that the doses used in the included studies are larger than what would typically be used in acute pain. In summary, the available evidence for oral ketamine in acute pain management is extremely limited. For IN ketamine, several small, randomized studies have been published demonstrating that IN ketamine is well tolerated and provides comparable or superior pain relief for 30 to 60 minutes to a variety of active comparators. However, these reports contain limited numbers of subjects, and few are blinded. Based on a review of these studies, we conclude that the use of IN ketamine is beneficial for acute pain management, providing not only effective analgesia but also amnesia and procedural sedation. Particular scenarios in which this should be considered include individuals for whom IV access is difficult and children undergoing procedures (grade C recommendation, low-to-moderate level of certainty). For oral ketamine, the evidence is less robust, but small studies and anecdotal reports suggest it may provide short-term benefit in some individuals with acute pain (grade C recommendation, low level of certainty).", "type": "Document"}

Opioid medications are the most common analgesic medication administered using this method, but ketamine has also been used in IV-PCA as the sole analgesic and in combination with opioids to improve pain control and reduce opioid-related adverse effects. Ketamine as a sole IV-PCA analgesic was effective in treating central pain in a single case report (average of 7 mg/h), pediatric neuropathic pain in a case series (median dose of 0.06 mg/kg per hour), and for pain from burn dressing changes in a small, uncontrolled observational study (average dose of 94 mg over 78 minutes). No double-blind RCTs were identified. The effect of ketamine added to an opioid in an IV-PCA on postoperative pain intensity, cumulative opioid consumption, and AEs was examined in 2 recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses. The available RCTs examining this question had heterogeneity in patient population and IV-PCA opioid, dosage, and administration parameters. The majority of trials were performed on adults. Most trials used morphine as the coadministered opioid, but others used fentanyl, hydromorphone, or tramadol. The dosages of ketamine varied from 1 to 5 mg per bolus. A majority of trials used a demand-only IV-PCA with a prescribed lockout period, whereas others used a demand IV-PCA with a continuous background infusion, and still others provided no documented protocol. The variations in practice contribute to the mixed results that were noted. Despite the heterogeneity, statistical modeling based on the available trial data showed a benefit from the addition of ketamine to an opioid IV-PCA in 24-hour pain intensity and immediate postoperative nausea and vomiting, with no increase in the likelihood of hallucinations. Opioid consumption up to 96 hours was reduced, with no change found in the incidence of urinary retention, pruritus, and nausea. Differences based on dosage and respiratory AEs could not be determined with the available data. Overall, we conclude that evidence is limited for the benefit of IV-PCA\u2013delivered ketamine as the sole analgesic for acute or periprocedural pain (grade C recommendation, low level of certainty). We conclude that moderate evidence supports the benefit of the addition of ketamine to an opioid-based IV-PCA for acute and perioperative pain management (grade B recommendation, moderate level of certainty).", "type": "Document"}
{"id": null, "metadata": {"source": "PMC6023582.txt", "chunk_id": 392, "char_count": 5349}, "page_content": "### FUTURE DIRECTIONS AND CONCLUSIONS\nBy current standards, ketamine is an old drug that has been used clinically as an anesthetic agent since the 1970s. The desire for analgesic alternatives to opioids, especially in light of the current public health crisis and evidence that short-term opioid use may lead to chronic opioid therapy in some patients, has led to renewed interest in the use of ketamine as an analgesic in the acute pain setting. However, practitioners have little guidance regarding key questions concerning indications, contraindications, patient selection, dosing, adverse effects, and expected outcomes. These guidelines have attempted to summarize existing literature with a particular focus on crucial issues that directly impact ketamine's use in acute pain, including expert opinion when evidence is lacking. The published evidence demonstrates a clear short-term, opioid-sparing effect when ketamine is used in subanesthetic doses as a perioperative adjunct, regardless of whether it is given as a bolus, infusion, or via PCA. Multiple reviews have covered this topic adequately, making additional review articles unlikely to uncover new evidence or reveal new conclusions in the absence of more data. Additional RCTs that include opioid-tolerant patients with different degrees of tolerance and different pain subtypes, such as acute neuropathic pain, could provide new information that may assist practitioners (Table The primary issue preventing widespread adoption of ketamine infusions outside operative or intensive care unit settings is the potential for adverse psychomimetic and cardiovascular effects. Although the RCTs as well as observational studies have reported varying rates of psychomimetic effects, almost all allowed opioids, benzodiazepines, and other concurrent medications that confounded the results. Studies comparing different dosing ranges are lacking, and blinding can be difficult or impossible. Although a clear, dose-dependent relationship for psychomimetic effects has not yet been established for subanesthetic doses, because nearly all therapeutic and most adverse pharmacologic effects are dose-related, this is another area ripe for investigation. Also needed are additional studies comparing different dose ranges and studies enrolling patients with primary pain or comorbid conditions that have not been well studied, such as sickle cell disease, pancreatitis, and OSA. However, we acknowledge the difficulty of studying such populations, given the lack of industry interest in funding large, multicenter studies and the ethical and practical concerns related to enrolling patients with acute pain conditions in a controlled clinical trial. Trials that enroll patients with cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, hepatic dysfunction, or neurologic disease who receive subanesthetic ketamine are important to perform to delineate the safety profile of ketamine in these populations. Those patients have traditionally been excluded from most studies but are frequently present in acute pain settings in which few other alternatives are available. The use of ketamine to prevent persistent postsurgical pain (PPSP) has been extensively studied, although individual studies tend to be underpowered, considering the relatively low incidence of PPSP, the anticipated small effect size, and the difficulties inherent in limiting cointerventions in the perioperative period, and are therefore subject to the same methodological limitations that apply to those evaluating ketamine for acute and chronic pain management. A recent meta-analysis demonstrated a very small effect size (number-needed-to-treat of 12 at 3 months and 14 at 6 months) for preventive ketamine in a perioperative context, which indicates a need to better identify the patients and surgical procedures most likely to benefit from ketamine and to determine whether the use of ketamine in conjunction with other adjuvants may prove more effective, as well as the dose and treatment duration required for reducing PPSP. Nonparenteral ketamine, especially IN ketamine, is likely to continue to increase in use for acute exacerbations of chronic pain conditions. It has been studied mostly in the emergency medicine setting, where it provides brief but potent analgesia, especially for procedures. Studies focused on long-term use of IN ketamine are important to establish sustained benefit and better characterize the adverse effect profile. The lack of FDA approval of nonparenteral ketamine formulations for any indication will likely make these studies difficult to perform. In conclusion, despite its drawbacks, ketamine remains a powerful and inexpensive tool for practitioners who manage acute pain. We believe its use will continue to expand as more institutions treat increasingly challenging patients in the perioperative period as well as those with painful disease exacerbations while trying to combat the opioid epidemic. More research is needed to refine selection criteria for the treatment of acute pain and possible prevention of chronic pain, to determine the ideal dosing and treatment regimen to include coadministration of ketamine with opioids and adjuvants, and to better understand the long-term risks of ketamine in patients who receive serial treatments for frequent acute pain exacerbations.\n", "type": "Document"}

This guideline seeks to address questions regarding the intraoperative care of patients with OSA, including airway management, anesthetic drug and agent effects, and choice of anesthesia type. Given the paucity of high-quality studies with regard to study design and execution in this perioperative field, recommendations were to a large part developed by subject-matter experts through consensus processes, taking into account the current scientific knowledge base and quality of evidence. This guideline may not be suitable for all clinical settings and patients and is not intended to define standards of care or absolute requirements for patient care; thus, assessment of appropriateness should be made on an individualized basis. Adherence to this guideline cannot guarantee successful outcomes, but recommendations should rather aid health care professionals and institutions to formulate plans and develop protocols for the improvement of the perioperative care of patients with OSA, considering patient-related factors, interventions, and resource availability. Given the groundwork of a comprehensive systematic literature review, these recommendations reflect the current state of knowledge and its interpretation by a group of experts at the time of publication. While periodic reevaluations of literature are needed, novel scientific evidence between updates should be taken into account. Deviations in practice from the guideline may be justifiable and should not be interpreted as a basis for claims of negligence.", "type": "Document"}

Clinical research as it relates to best perioperative practices in OSA is burdened by numerous difficulties. The intraoperative setting involves a multitude of concurrent interventions and use of anesthetic medications, making it difficult to single out specific factors that potentially drive the adverse outcome. Lack of preoperative polysomnography data within publications represents a further challenge, making it difficult to include information of the impact of disease severity. Ethical considerations in study designs regarding the randomization of patients with known OSA were additional obstacles in this context. Furthermore, the task force recognizes that there is a tendency to underreport medical complications, rendering it difficult to establish the true perioperative risk. Presenting the current available evidence and its limitations should raise awareness regarding the need for high-quality studies in the future. Specific aims were to: (1) evaluate considerations of difficult airway management in patients with OSA, (2) assess the impact of individual anesthesia-related drugs and agents in the care of patients with OSA, and (3) evaluate best anesthetic techniques in this patient population. To achieve these aims, a question-driven approach was sought. In areas lacking sufficient published evidence, the task force sought to establish expert consensus while considering related literature. Patients affected by sleep-disordered breathing unrelated to OSA, including hypoventilation syndromes, periodic breathing, and central apnea unrelated to OSA, were not considered in this project. This decision was made a priori to reduce the influence of heterogeneity in our assessment given the lack of evidence on which to base recommendations for these specific populations.", "type": "Document"}

These levels were assigned to the body of evidence of each respective recommendation within their focus area and reflect the confidence in estimates of the true effect. When moving from evidence to recommendations, the GRADE approach focuses on 4 factors: balance between benefit and harm, certainty of evidence, values and preferences, and resource considerations.

Ten studies confirmed OSA by overnight polysomnography or electronic database entries, 3 used the STOP-Bang screening questionnaire, 2 identified patients by clinical diagnosis, and 1 used both polysomnography and the STOP-Bang questionnaire. In total, 266,603 patients were included in 16 studies. Of those patients, 32,052 had OSA (identified by polysomnography, electronic database, chart or clinical diagnoses, and STOP-Bang questionnaires) and 234,551 did not. In summary, 12 studies reported on difficult intubation, 6 on difficult mask ventilation, 2 on both difficult intubation and mask ventilation, and 2 on failed supraglottic airway.

DIFFICULT AIRWAY AND OSA > Prevalence of OSA in Patients With Difficult Intubation\nTwo studies elucidated the association between OSA and difficult intubation in a reverse manner by investigating the rate of OSA among patients with difficult intubation. In a retrospective study, Hiremath et al, using an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) \u226510 as a cutoff, found that 53% of patients with difficult airway had OSA. This finding was confirmed by a prospective controlled study by Chung et al. using an AHI \u22655 as a cutoff for OSA diagnosis. Patients who were determined to have a difficult airway were referred for polysomnography after surgery, and 66% were shown to have OSA. Kim and Lee showed that patients with an AHI \u226540 had a significantly higher prevalence of difficult intubation. For patients with OSA with AHIs \u226440, 40\u201370, and \u226570, the incidence of difficult intubation was 3.3%, 19.3%, and 27.6%, respectively. Anatomical skeletal and soft tissue changes may contribute to a difficult airway in OSA. However, these observations are \u201chypothesis-generating\u201d rather than \u201chypothesis-proving\u201d findings. The shared anatomical abnormalities explain the positive association between difficult airway and OSA. A number of studies evaluated the association of difficult airway management with OSA using the STOP-Bang questionnaire to identify patients at high risk of OSA. The sensitivity and specificity of the STOP-Bang questionnaire can vary according to the prevalence and severity of OSA. This variation can create false-positive and false-negative cases in both OSA and non-OSA groups, leading to potential misclassification bias. One of the contributing factors for adverse respiratory events in patients with OSA is the increased risk of difficult airway management, such as difficult intubation, difficult mask ventilation, or both. In a recent report, there were 7 litigation cases where OSA was associated with either death or anoxic brain injury due to difficult airway management in the form of failure to reintubate in the postoperative period. Knowledge about the association between OSA and difficult airway may improve perioperative airway management and decrease airway-related complications. In view of ethical considerations, it is difficult to perform RCTs in patients with OSA to determine its associations with difficult airway management. As a result, only observational prospective and retrospective studies are available in the literature. The end estimates of these studies indicate that there is an increased risk of difficult airway management in patients with OSA.

INTRAOPERATIVE MEDICATION USE IN PATIENTS WITH OSA > 2.1 Neuromuscular Blocking Agents > Rationale.\nNMBAs are commonly used to optimize intubation conditions and provide surgical relaxation for various procedures. However, residual neuromuscular blockade has been reported to occur in \u226464% of patients in postanesthesia care units. The use of NMBAs and residual neuromuscular blockade has been associated with significant postoperative respiratory complications such as hypoxemia, upper airway obstruction, and pneumonia. High doses of NMBA given during abdominal surgery were associated with an increased risk of 30-day readmission, increased length of hospital stay, and increased hospital cost. A retrospective review of a single-center database showed that patients who required tracheal intubation within the first 3 days after surgery had a significantly higher frequency of NMBA administration and reversal with neostigmine. Residual neuromuscular blockade may persist despite the administration of neostigmine reversal, especially when neuromuscular monitoring is not utilized. It is unclear whether patients with OSA may be at higher risk for postoperative respiratory complications due to the adverse effects of postoperative residual neuromuscular blockade compared to patients without OSA. Moreover, it is uncertain whether the type of reversal agent impacts the risk of postoperative complications in patients with OSA. Patients with suspected or confirmed OSA have been shown to be at increased risk for early postoperative respiratory complications, including emergent intubation, mechanical ventilation, noninvasive ventilation, respiratory failure, desaturation, and pneumonia. The use of NMBA was not described in these studies. Many patients with OSA are obese and have anatomical risk factors that may increase vulnerability to the effects of residual neuromuscular blockade on the upper airway and pharyngeal function. Our literature search yielded 5 studies that were heterogeneous in terms of study design, types of surgery, and types of respiratory complications. Many studies were excluded because OSA diagnosis or use of NMBA was not described. One RCT and 2 observational studies were included to address the question of whether patients with OSA are at a higher risk for postoperative respiratory complications from the use of NMBA compared to patients without OSA. Although the level of evidence was limited (Oxford LOE 2\u20133), the studies suggest that patients with OSA who received NMBA may be at increased risk of effects of residual neuromuscular blockade, postoperative respiratory failure, and hypoxemia. The results of our review are consistent with previous studies showing that patients with OSA are at higher risk of postoperative respiratory failure and hypoxemia than patients without OSA. Even partial residual neuromuscular blockade that does not evoke respiratory symptoms can impair upper airway dilator muscle function. Minimizing the use and dose of NMBA, monitoring the level of neuromuscular blockade, and complete reversal of NMBA before extubation may be particularly important for patients with OSA. While not considering OSA status, reversal of NMBA with sugammadex, a cyclodextrin used to reverse rocuronium, has been shown to decrease the incidence of residual paralysis compared to the anticholinesterase inhibitor, neostigmine. A recent Cochrane review of 41 studies comparing sugammadex with neostigmine concluded that patients receiving sugammadex versus neostigmine had 40% fewer composite adverse events (bradycardia, postoperative nausea and vomiting, and residual neuromuscular blockade). Patients receiving sugammadex had less desaturation and need for transitory oxygen supplementation; however, the OSA status was not reported in these reviews, limiting its value to assess its differential effect in this subpopulation. There are limited studies comparing the impact of different neuromuscular blocking reversal agents on postoperative respiratory complications in patients with OSA. We identified 1 RCT and 1 observational study that compared sugammadex to neostigmine. In the 2 studies, 209 patients with OSA and 185 patients without OSA were included. The RCT (n = 74) found that patients receiving sugammadex versus neostigmine had less postoperative respiratory complications (desaturation, hypoxemia, apnea, airway manipulation, airway usage, reintubation, continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP] therapy, and invasive mechanical ventilation). There was no difference in airway obstruction. The observational study (n = 320) compared sugammadex to a historical cohort of patients who received neostigmine reversal for laparoscopic bariatric surgeries. Patients with OSA who received sugammadex versus neostigmine had less postoperative chest radiographic changes (atelectasis, pleural effusions), 6.9% vs 16.3% (odds ratio [OR], 0.36; 95% CI, 0.18\u20130.8), but there were no differences in postoperative mechanical ventilation or hospital length of stay. Although both studies showed a reduction in some postoperative respiratory complications, the evidence is limited because the number of patients included in the RCT (Oxford LOE: 2) was small, and the observational study (Oxford LOE: 3) reported no difference in clinical outcomes. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of sugammadex over neostigmine to reduce the risk of postoperative respiratory complications in patients with OSA. More trials with larger sample sizes are needed in this patient population.", "type": "Document"}

INTRAOPERATIVE MEDICATION USE IN PATIENTS WITH OSA > 2.2 Opioids > Rationale.\nWhile opioids are highly effective in treating moderate to severe pain, their intrinsic capacity to suppress ventilatory drive demands caution in OSA. Despite consensus among perioperative physicians to restrict or avoid opioids in OSA, the presence of robust, high-quality scientific evidence to demonstrate the merit of heightened concern and guide safe opioid practice in this population is limited. Nevertheless, despite limitations with respect to the quality of evidence suggesting an adverse impact of acute opioid administration in OSA, current literature indicates that a heightened concern regarding opioid use in this population may be justified. A summary of evidence is provided in Supplemental Digital Content, Table A2, http://links.lww.com/AA/C373. Specifically, 17 observational studies exploring the impact of systemic opioid use in OSA were identified. While the majority demonstrated an association between opioid use and adverse perioperative outcomes in OSA, this was not confirmed by all. It should be noted that, particularly among observational analyses, there is notable heterogeneity with regard to the modality of OSA assessment, ranging from the gold standard of polysomnography to identification by screening questionnaires or patient history. Furthermore, potential selection bias should be considered in these studies. In recent publications, a comparison of postoperative complications among patients with and without OSA within the same study cohort revealed that the incidence of postoperative pulmonary (2.49% vs 1.83%), cardiac (2.81% vs 0.23%), gastrointestinal (0.45% vs 0.33%), renal (3.47% vs 1.83%), and thromboembolic (0.41% vs 0.33%) complications was higher in patients with OSA at similar opioid dose levels. Additional analysis of the impact of opioid dose increase within patients with OSA demonstrated an associated increase in the odds for gastrointestinal complications, prolonged length of stay, and increased hospital cost, while no further increase in risk for pulmonary complications was observed, possibly due to increased levels of monitoring afforded to this population. A higher incidence of postoperative complications in OSA versus non-OSA in this context was also found by Blake et al and Esclamado et al, while the latter conducted their study in upper airway surgery, a procedure with a potentially inherent influence on respiratory outcome. Chung et al demonstrated an opioid dose-dependent postoperative worsening of sleep-disordered breathing associated with the severity of OSA (expressed by AHI), although this effect may have been fairly small. Male patients with OSA had a significantly higher central apnea index on postoperative night 1 versus female patients with OSA. In this context, numerous other observational studies took a different approach by investigating the occurrence of critical, life-threatening respiratory events, such as respiratory failure and naloxone requirement and identifying drivers for these complications. Moreover, a recent systematic review reported that the majority of surgical patients with OSA experiencing perioperative death or near-death events received a morphine equivalent dose of <10 mg/d. Subramani et al suggested that a dose-response pattern with increased odds for complications at increasing opioid dose levels (ORs of 1.0, 1.5, and 3.0 at opioid doses of <10, 10\u201325, and >25 mg; P for trend <.005) exists. In contrast, others who restricted their focus to patients with obesity, a population of high OSA prevalence, demonstrated that, although postoperative respiratory complications in the context of opioid analgesia were common, surprisingly, OSA could not be established as an independent risk factor. However, a factor potentially causing an underestimation of a possible deleterious effect of OSA was the postoperative use of positive airway pressure therapy among patients with OSA. Moreover, a proof of concept analysis by Wang et al suggested that the experimental oral administration of 30 mg controlled-release morphine in 10 volunteers outside the surgical setting paradoxically improved oxygenation through modulating chemoreflexes. In summary, evidence from observational analyses suggests that opioid use in the presence of OSA presents a risk factor for postoperative critical respiratory events (Oxford LOE 3\u20134). With regard to evidence from RCTs, 6 such studies were identified (Oxford LOE 2). In a volunteer study, Bernards et al directly demonstrated that opioid administration during sleep increased the number of central apneas, leading to decreased saturation levels in patients with OSA versus those without OSA. Abdelmageed et al demonstrated that opioid dose reduction significantly reduced the incidence of central apneas and respiratory events in patients with OSA. While interesting, it must be noted that opioid reduction may decrease respiratory depression and related complications in the general population as well. Using a nonvalidated OSA prediction instrument, Blake et al showed that central apneas and respiratory events were related to the dose of morphine administered postoperatively. However, differences in the occurrence of respiratory complications between patients with standard morphine patient-controlled analgesia and an opioid-sparing regimen could not be established. Other studies explored the safety of neuraxial opioid administration in patients with OSA. In a systematic review, Orlov et al found that the incidence of major cardiorespiratory complications after neuraxial opioid administrations was 4.1% among patients with OSA. However, the authors also emphasized that significant limitations in the quality of evidence and persistent underreporting of adverse events prevented an accurate and robust assessment of true perioperative risk. A prospective study in patients having a cesarean delivery with intrathecal morphine administration demonstrated that OSA and obesity were associated with approximately a 2-fold increase in risk for desaturation. However, another observational analysis of 990 patients undergoing orthopedic surgery with intrathecal morphine could not find an association between OSA and adverse pulmonary events. In summary, limited literature suggests that patients with OSA may be at increased risk for opioid-related respiratory adverse events. However, high-quality evidence to support and prove this notion is largely lacking (Oxford LOE 2\u20134).", "type": "Document"}

INTRAOPERATIVE MEDICATION USE IN PATIENTS WITH OSA > 2.2 Opioids > Pain and Opioid Analgesia in OSA.\nA systematic evaluation of opioid-related respiratory effects in OSA requires focused attention on closely related issues such as pain perception and pharmacology of opioid analgesia. A summary of evidence is provided in Supplemental Digital Content, Table A3, http://links.lww.com/AA/C373 (Oxford LOE 3). Characterizing these relationships is important because the dose of opioids that is required to treat pain, as well as the sensitivity to these medications, directly influence the likelihood of opioid-induced respiratory depression. Disturbed sleep continuity and intermittent hypoxia are 2 important features of OSA. Studies in humans have repeatedly demonstrated that fragmented or chronically curtailed sleep and insomnia, a condition highly comorbid with OSA, are associated with heightened sensitivity to pain. Among 3 identified studies examining the response to experimental pain in subjects suffering from OSA, 1 study found that patients with OSA and comorbid temporomandibular joint disorder experienced hypoalgesia to pressure-related pain, while another reported a significant increase in pain threshold after restoring sleep continuity with the application of CPAP therapy. In contrast, the third investigation found no association between wake-after-sleep-onset or nocturnal nadir blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) polysomnographic parameters and threshold/tolerance to thermal pain. In the context of chronic pain, a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from the Cleveland Family Study showed that chronic intermittent hypoxia was associated with more frequent chronic pain complaints, even after adjusting for the potentially hyperalgesic effect of sleep fragmentation and systemic inflammation. Despite the primary goal to focus on the adult patient population in this guideline, a significant amount of evidence originates from the pediatric population and deserves mention here particularly because they show contradictory findings to those found among adults. In children undergoing adenotonsillectomy for treatment of OSA, 2 case\u2013control studies, 1 retrospective and 1 prospective, showed that patients with a preoperative nocturnal nadir SpO2 <85% required half the dose of morphine to treat postoperative pain, versus those with a nadir SpO2 \u226585%. Two prospective case\u2013control studies in the same population did not confirm these findings. In the first study, African American children versus Caucasian children with OSA presented with more pain requiring a higher dose of morphine for postoperative analgesia. The second study showed that children with OSA (respiratory disturbance index >5) required more morphine for postoperative analgesia, but they also demonstrated a higher incidence of opioid-related respiratory complications. In adults, 1 retrospective analysis found that bariatric patients with nocturnal hypoxemia (expressed as percentage of total sleep time spent at oxygen saturation [SaO2] <90%) required less opioids for postoperative analgesia, whereas another prospective study did not detect any association between preoperative nocturnal hypoxemia and postoperative opioid use in general surgical patients with OSA. A more detailed and comprehensive summary of evidence on the potential impact of acute opioid analgesia in OSA is provided in a separate systematic review by the SASM opioids focus group (members listed in the acknowledgments).", "type": "Document"}

The use of propofol to induce general anesthesia purposefully suppresses respiratory activity and was thus deferred in this section. Propofol is the most commonly used agent for DISE. A summary of findings from 5 studies is shown in Supplemental Digital Content, Table A4, http://links.lww.com/AA/C373 (Oxford LOE: 2\u20134). Both body mass index (BMI) and severity of OSA correlated with a greater likelihood of a patient having multiple sites of airway collapse and a higher possibility of circumferential and total airway obstruction during DISE. The goal of propofol administration for DISE is to produce a sleep-like loss of consciousness and muscle relaxation to precipitate pharyngeal narrowing and collapse in vulnerable individuals. To avoid the problem of profound relaxation or central apnea, it has been suggested that initial dosing for DISE be judiciously titrated. Attempts have been made to formulate a mathematical equation to model the pharmacokinetics for propofol in patients with obesity (Supplemental Digital Content, Table A5, http://links.lww.com/AA/C373). Uncertainty regarding dosing scalar adjustments that may be required in patients with obesity, as well as the concomitant use of depressant drugs with synergistic effects (midazolam, ketamine, dexmedetomidine, opioids), further add to the need for heightened vigilance when using propofol for patients with OSA. Propofol has a relatively steep dose-response curve compared to other sedatives/hypnotics, thus underscoring the importance of careful titration. Adverse effects are not uncommon in patients with OSA undergoing procedures with propofol sedation. A summary of findings from 5 studies is shown in Supplemental Digital Content, Table A6, http://links.lww.com/AA/C373. OSA, increased BMI, male gender, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status \u2265III, initial dose of propofol, and increased age were found to be independent risk factors for hypoxemic incidents. Airway interventions were common in patients receiving propofol, although indications for airway intervention were left to the discretion of the anesthesia provider. Whether precautionary or subsequent to an obstructed airway, apneic, or desaturation episode, such airway interventions were undoubtedly done to prevent or mitigate a sedation-related adverse event. The use of capnography was associated with a decreased incidence of hypoxic events compared to standard monitoring alone during sedation with propofol in patients with OSA.", "type": "Document"}

INTRAOPERATIVE MEDICATION USE IN PATIENTS WITH OSA > 2.4 Inhalational Agents > Rationale.\nThere is a lack of scientific literature to guide best intraoperative practices in OSA regarding the preferred technique among various inhalational agents and intravenous propofol for the maintenance of anesthesia. Nevertheless, a significant amount of evidence has been published on the general population and patients with obesity. Evidence from the population with obesity may merit consideration in this context, given the close association to OSA, reflected in the substantial OSA prevalence of \u226490% in male bariatric patients. Notably, there is significant overlap between obesity and OSA with regard to challenges in general anesthesia because of altered cardiorespiratory physiology, including decreased functional residual capacity, upper airway obstruction, and the propensity to hypoxemia in perioperative settings. This renders the period of emergence and recovery from anesthesia of high concern regarding the risk for detrimental outcomes. In this context, 25 studies were identified that compared the efficacy and recovery profile among the most common inhalational agents and intravenous propofol. A summary of evidence is provided in Supplemental Digital Content, Tables A7 and A8, http://links.lww.com/AA/C373. Comparing propofol and isoflurane, propofol was suggested to be associated with a faster recovery from anesthesia and improved postoperative respiratory control in 2 RCTs. However, sevoflurane was found to be superior to propofol in 2 RCTs due to faster anesthesia recovery and improved hemodynamic stability. In addition, recently Fassbender et al reported no difference with regard to postoperative obstructive and hypoxemic events between the 2 anesthetic agents when combined with remifentanil. Furthermore, comparing propofol and desflurane, 1 study demonstrated that the use of propofol impaired pulmonary function and SpO2 to a greater degree than desflurane, while another could not confirm these differences. Thus, current evidence indicates that sevoflurane and desflurane might be superior to intravenous propofol in terms of anesthesia recovery in patients with obesity (Oxford LOE: 2). Similarly, 4 RCTs conducted in the population with obesity supported the notion that sevoflurane was associated with favorable features compared to isoflurane. In particular, Sudr\u00e9 et al demonstrated that sevoflurane embedded in a short-acting anesthetic regimen comprised of remifentanil, rocuronium, and ropivacaine improved emergence from anesthesia and reduced respiratory complications, postoperative anesthesia care unit stay, and hospital length of stay when compared to isoflurane within a long-acting regimen. This analysis emphasized the plausible benefit of generally utilizing short-acting medications with regard to all anesthetic drug classes, including opioids and NMBA, among patients at higher perioperative risk. The majority of studies, however, focused on the comparative effectiveness between sevoflurane and desflurane, demonstrating improved anesthesia recovery with desflurane (Oxford LOE: 2). Notably, limitations inherent to the nature of these comparisons can prevent the detection of differences. For instance, Eger and Shafer showed that differences in postoperative wake-up times among anesthetics were minimal at lower anesthetic concentrations, while the duration of anesthesia and BMI present important covariates. Summarizing the evidence, a well-designed systematic review by Liu et al provided a comprehensive comparison with quantitative analysis of immediate postoperative recovery after desflurane, isoflurane, sevoflurane, and intravenous propofol anesthesia in patients with obesity. In addition, a rather small clinical trial by Juvin et al also compared desflurane, isoflurane, and propofol together in 1 analysis. Both Liu et al and Juvin et al established desflurane as the most favorable anesthetic agent because of its superior postoperative recovery profile. Specifically, it was observed that patients who received desflurane anesthesia required less time to respond to commands, eye opening, hand squeezing, tracheal extubation, and name stating. Moreover, desflurane reduced sedation levels and conferred higher postoperative SpO2. It appears, therefore, that postoperative recovery might occur faster and with improved hemodynamic stability after anesthesia with desflurane followed by sevoflurane (Supplemental Digital Content, Table A7, http://links.lww.com/AA/C373), and these findings have also been observed in the general population. Consistently, desflurane and sevoflurane feature low blood-gas partition coefficients, conferring greater intraoperative control of anesthesia depth, as well as rapid and consistent postoperative emergence and recovery. These properties, in turn, imply earlier achievement of baseline respiratory function with potentially better protection against aspiration and improved oxygenation. This has also been supported by the observation of decreases in hypoxemia in clinical trials. Both obesity and OSA predispose patients to higher risk of postoperative upper airway obstruction and serious hypoxemia, thus suggesting a benefit associated with early and rapid recovery of active airway control and alertness. Another intervention, possibly promoting increased safety in OSA, is the intraoperative monitoring of anesthesia depth. This has been suggested by Ibraheim et al and Freo et al, who demonstrated that monitoring for titration of levels of inhalational agents reduced the required anesthetic dosage and improved the postanesthetic recovery in patients with obesity. Furthermore, Katznelson et al suggested that recovery time after general anesthesia in patients with and without obesity can be accelerated using either isocapnic or hypercapnic hyperpnea. In summary, the available evidence supports the use of desflurane and sevoflurane in patients with obesity (Oxford LOE: 2). Given the strong association between obesity and OSA, and the benefits of accelerating and improving postoperative anesthesia recovery, these outcomes are desirable and may apply to patients with OSA as well. However, except for 2 RCTs, no studies specifically in OSA are available, and thus no specific recommendations can be made.", "type": "Document"}

Ketamine has mostly been studied with respect to its potent analgesic effects as a sedative and hypnotic and, more recently, to reduce opioid use. There are only a few studies involving ketamine use in patients with OSA, but data are insufficient to draw any firm conclusions. Adverse effects of ketamine, such as neuropsychiatric effects, signs of increased sympathetic system activation (hypertension and tachycardia), and hypersalivation, are well documented in patients without OSA. Although patients with OSA are not specifically studied, these adverse events most likely translate to increased risk in this patient population as well. Adverse events are mostly seen in patients who received high doses, meaning >0.5 mg/kg boluses and 100 \u00b5g/kg/h infusions. Ketamine has been shown to have some beneficial effects. Studies demonstrated that ketamine, when combined with other sedative medications, mostly propofol, may decrease respiratory-related adverse effects. One such prospective observational study looking at sedation-related risk factors (airway obstruction, hypoventilation, and desaturation) for procedural sedation found ketamine to be a protective factor. De Oliveira et al reported that ketamine decreased duration and severity of hypercapnia in patients undergoing breast surgery under deep sedation. Furthermore, Drummond studied the effect of ketamine versus midazolam on upper airway function. Interestingly, they found decreased upper airway muscle activity in the midazolam group, which resulted in airway obstruction, whereas no change in muscle activity was observed in the ketamine group. In another study, genioglossus muscle activity, tidal volume, and respiratory rate have been shown to be increased after administration of high and low doses of ketamine in rats. Upper airway dilator muscle activity plays an important role in patients who are at risk of upper airway obstruction. Despite the lack of data on ketamine in the patient population with OSA, available information suggests that these patients could benefit from potentially favorable respiratory effects over other sedatives. Firm conclusions, however, cannot be drawn at this time.", "type": "Document"}

INTRAOPERATIVE MEDICATION USE IN PATIENTS WITH OSA > 2.6 Benzodiazepines > Rationale.\nAlthough the literature is immature on the topic of differential effects of intravenous benzodiazepine sedation in patients with OSA compared to those without OSA, studies suggest that the use of intravenous benzodiazepines is associated with airway compromise in patients with OSA. Intravenous benzodiazepine sedation is routinely used to induce airway collapse for diagnostic purposes in OSA. Much of the literature revolves around the use of intravenous benzodiazepines for DISE in a diagnostic context to examine locations and patterns of obstruction in patients with OSA. Midazolam is the most commonly used intravenous benzodiazepine for DISE. In 7 studies, the majority of patients had multilevel obstruction, especially those with higher AHI. Two studies evaluated sleep staging during midazolam-induced sleep. The first showed that patients spent the most time in nonrapid eye movement sleep stage N1 and N2 but not in stage N3 and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. The second reported that patients reached N2 sleep without further deepening of sleep stage. Because most obstructive events occur in N1 and N2 sleep, DISE with intravenous midazolam is considered a good option to study obstructive events in patients with OSA. Interestingly, Sadaoka et al found that patients with OSA had oxygen desaturation and apneas during DISE with intravenous diazepam more frequently than simple snorers. Another category of studies described the use of intravenous benzodiazepines for sleep imaging. Thus, a retrospective analysis by Lee et al compared 53 patients with OSA to 10 simple snorers. All patients with OSA had desaturation events after 2 mg of midazolam, but none in the simple snorers group had such events. We identified 5 studies evaluating intravenous benzodiazepines in the context of other endoscopic or surgical procedures. Midazolam was used either alone or in combination with fentanyl. One study did not specify which benzodiazepines were used. Three studies compared outcomes between patients with and without OSA. In a retrospective cohort study by Adler et al, 215 patients undergoing routine endoscopy were randomized to 4 groups: patients with OSA undergoing endoscopy with propofol or midazolam + fentanyl and patients without OSA undergoing endoscopy with propofol or midazolam + fentanyl. A comparison of patients with and without OSA receiving midazolam and fentanyl showed that desaturation events and other complications were not significantly different. Notably, doses of midazolam and fentanyl needed for colonoscopy were slightly lower in patients with OSA, although the procedure time was moderately longer. Cha et al published a prospective study that compared cardiopulmonary complications during routine esophagogastroduodenoscopy under sedation with midazolam between 31 patients with OSA and 65 healthy controls. Patients with OSA received a higher dose of midazolam than patients without OSA, but cardiopulmonary complications were not increased in patients with OSA. Mador et al conducted a prospective study in 904 patients undergoing endoscopy to investigate whether OSA, assessed by the Berlin questionnaire, increases the risk of complications during sedation with midazolam and fentanyl. Major complications were observed in 3.25% of patients with low risk for OSA and in 1.9% of patients with high risk for OSA (OR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.26\u20131.46; P = .21). Minor complications were observed in 10.56% of patients with low OSA risk and 10.63% of patients with high OSA risk (OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.65\u20131.56; P = 1.0), suggesting that OSA was not associated with increased risk for cardiopulmonary complications during endoscopy under sedation with midazolam and fentanyl in this analysis. In conclusion, 5 studies directly compared outcomes between patients with and without OSA after intravenous benzodiazepine sedation in the context of anesthesia. However, only 2 studies were able to establish a higher risk for respiratory complications in patients with OSA (Oxford LOE: 3).

INTRAOPERATIVE MEDICATION USE IN PATIENTS WITH OSA > 2.7 \u03b1-2 Agonists > Rationale.\nDexmedetomidine and clonidine are centrally acting \u03b1-2 agonists with sedative, analgesic, and sympatholytic properties. Dexmedetomidine, in particular, has been suggested to cause minimal respiratory depression. Because OSA is associated with an increased risk of adverse postoperative pulmonary events, the potentially favorable respiratory profile and analgesic-sparing effects theoretically make \u03b1-2 agonists appealing for this population. When assessing the risk of adverse events with the use of \u03b1-2 agonists, no eligible studies compared patients with OSA to patients without OSA. The majority of studies focused on OSA or bariatric populations, comparing the use of \u03b1-2 agonists to either placebo or other medications. The body of literature is limited by a small total number of subjects, inconsistent results, lack of uniformity in outcomes, and low adverse event rates. Although many studies demonstrate statistical differences in hemodynamic parameters with \u03b1-2 agonists, the translation into clinically meaningful outcome differences is not supported at this time. Four studies compared the use of dexmedetomidine to propofol in DISE as summarized in Supplemental Digital Content, Table A10, http://links.lww.com/AA/C373 (propofol in DISE has also been discussed in Section 2.3). In a series by Capasso et al, patients receiving propofol had a significantly increased likelihood of complete tongue base obstruction versus partial or no obstruction compared to those receiving dexmedetomidine. The 2 other studies that examined aspects of airway obstruction did not demonstrate significant differences between the dexmedetomidine and comparison groups. Three DISE studies measured intraprocedural respiratory and hemodynamic parameters. Two studies demonstrated a decrease in respiratory rate and lower SpO2 with propofol compared to dexmedetomidine. In the study by Cho et al, mean SpO2 of the dexmedetomidine-remifentanil and propofol groups did not differ; however, it was significantly lower in the propofol-remifentanil group. This study showed no hemodynamic differences, a finding shared by Kuyrukluyildiz et al. Conversely, Yoon et al observed similar mean arterial pressure (MAP) but lower mean heart rate (HR) with dexmedetomidine and no episodes of clinically significant bradycardia. Kuyrukluyildiz et al measured postprocedure outcomes, finding significantly lower MAP and HR with dexmedetomidine. Mean SpO2 and respiratory rate were higher with dexmedetomidine, although only 1 patient receiving propofol required additional oxygen supplementation. These 4 studies were examined in a systematic review, which concluded that dexmedetomidine appeared to yield a more stable cardiopulmonary profile, while propofol offered a faster onset, a shorter half-life, and potentially a greater degree of airway obstruction. The authors emphasized that neither propofol nor dexmedetomidine has been validated in replicating the obstruction that occurs during sleep. The obstructive patterns could be due to drug effect rather than reflective of the natural sleep state. Consequently, additional investigation is necessary to ascertain the optimal sedative in DISE.", "type": "Document"}

INTRAOPERATIVE MEDICATION USE IN PATIENTS WITH OSA > 2.7 \u03b1-2 Agonists > Other Procedures.\nFor studies involving procedures other than DISE, adverse events were characterized according to respiratory effects, hemodynamic effects, and recovery profile (Supplemental Digital Content, Table A11, http://links.lww.com/AA/C373). Two studies reported respiratory outcomes during sedation procedures. In a descriptive series of 20 patients at high risk of OSA, 13 required interventions for airway obstruction and 2 for desaturation during endoscopy with combined dexmedetomidine\u2013propofol sedation. An RCT in upper respiratory procedures demonstrated that, compared to propofol target-controlled infusion, dexmedetomidine use resulted in lower desaturation incidence, higher SpO2 at most time points, and lower rates of airway obstruction. Data are limited regarding respiratory effects of dexmedetomidine in the postoperative recovery period. A descriptive series of bariatric patients reported adequate saturations with supplemental oxygen without the need for CPAP. Studies with quantitative data suggest that intraoperative use of dexmedetomidine may not affect the respiratory rate in bariatric patients and when compared to placebo may have a better recovery profile in individuals undergoing uvuloplasty. In another group of patients receiving postoperative sedation after uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, the dexmedetomidine group experienced less severe and less frequent cough during extubation and less respiratory depression compared to the propofol group. Finally, in a retrospective review comparing patients undergoing airway reconstruction surgery who received dexmedetomidine versus those who did not, neither group required interventions for airway compromise. Two studies examined the effect of clonidine on respiratory parameters and sleep in patients with OSA. In an RCT of 8 patients, clonidine compared to placebo suppressed the amount of time in REM sleep and decreased apnea duration during REM while not affecting overall AHI. Minimum SpO2 levels were higher in the clonidine group (86% \u00b1 1.5% vs 84% \u00b1 1.0%), reaching statistical but arguably not clinical significance. Pawlik et al performed an RCT in patients with OSA undergoing ear, nose, and throat surgery, with patients receiving either oral clonidine or placebo the night before and 2 hours before surgery. AHI in the night of surgery did not differ from baseline or between the 2 treatment groups. In both groups, the desaturation index decreased on the preoperative night, the day of the operation, and the postoperative night compared to their respective baseline measurements but did not differ between groups. The hemodynamic effects of \u03b1-2 agonists were assessed according to varied outcome measures, including vital sign measurements, categorical descriptors, and need for rescue medications. Intraoperatively, 3 studies demonstrated significantly lower MAPs with \u03b1-2 agonists, while 1 study showed no difference. Heart rate was significantly lower with dexmedetomidine in 3 studies, while no difference to controls was observed in 2 other studies. Chawla et al reported transient loading dose hypertension followed by \u201ctitratable, controlled hypotension, and bradycardia.\u201d Three studies demonstrated less frequent use of rescue antihypertensives or \u03b2 blockers among \u03b1-2 agonist groups intraoperatively; 1 study showed this postoperatively. Furthermore, 1 study demonstrated a greater incidence of need for phenylephrine support in patients receiving dexmedetomidine. In studies reporting the need for atropine and/or ephedrine, the overall incidence was low, and no differences were reported between treatment groups. Among studies that measured postoperative hemodynamics, there was inconsistency as to whether MAP was decreased with \u03b1-2 agonists or similar to that of the control patients. Xu et al also characterized outcomes according to categorical variables and found a decreased incidence of hypertension and tachycardia, as well as an increased incidence of bradycardia in the dexmedetomidine-treated group; the frequency of hypotension did not differ. The potential role of \u03b1-2 agonists in modulating the sympathetic response is of clinical interest. Four studies examined the effects of \u03b1-2 agonists on hemodynamics at points of stimulation, such as intubation, incision, and extubation. Only 1 study compared the measurements of each group to their respective baseline values, while all compared the measurements between treatment groups. Blood pressure and HR in the \u03b1-2 agonist groups were either lower than or similar to their control groups. Another group observed less frequent spikes in MAP and HR in clonidine-treated patients, but this was not statistically significant. The effects of \u03b1-2 agonists on recovery profile varied. Three studies demonstrated shorter time to extubation with \u03b1-2 agonists, 1 showed no difference compared to control patients, and another showed increased time to extubation. One series described prolonged drowsiness with dexmedetomidine, while another study showed no difference in sedation score compared to control patients. End points related to postoperative nausea/vomiting were examined in 1 observational study and 3 RCTs. In summary, the literature on the differential effect of \u03b1-2-agonists in patients with and without OSA is limited and results are nonuniform (Oxford LOE: 2\u20134). While a trend in statistical outcomes for some cardiorespiratory parameters may be observed, the clinical impact of these findings remains unknown.", "type": "Document"}

ANESTHESIA TECHNIQUE > Rationale > Anesthesia Technique as a Modifier of Postoperative Outcome.\nWith regard to comparative effectiveness between general and regional anesthesia specifically in patients with OSA, 6 observational studies were identified. A summary of evidence is provided in Supplemental Digital Content, Table A12, http://links.lww.com/AA/C373. Overall, studies indicated that the utilization of regional as opposed to general anesthesia would improve postoperative outcome. The largest population-based analysis included >30,000 patients with OSA from >400 US hospitals undergoing joint arthroplasty procedures. Adjusted risk of numerous major complications was significantly lower in patients with OSA who received neuraxial anesthesia versus general anesthesia. Furthermore, the addition of neuraxial to general anesthesia versus the use of general anesthesia alone was associated with improved outcome profiles. Additionally, the utilization of peripheral nerve blocks was associated with decreased odds for mechanical ventilation, critical care admissions, and prolonged hospital length of stay. Subsequent studies confirmed the previous findings, while 1 suggested benefits with regard to mortality. Notably, in a prospective analysis investigating drivers of postoperative worsening of sleep-disordered breathing, Chung et al demonstrated that the utilization of general anesthesia was associated with an increased central apnea index postoperatively, while 72-hour total opioid dose was a driver of increased AHI. This finding suggests that the residual effects of general anesthesia may affect postoperative sleep architecture and sleep-disordered breathing in OSA. Given the necessity of airway manipulation under general anesthesia, other challenges inherent to OSA should be considered as well. The higher risk for a difficult airway in OSA has been discussed in Section 1. However, challenges with regard to airway complications in patients with OSA appear to also extend to the time for emergence from anesthesia and the immediate postoperative period, potentially leading to the requirement of emergent airway interventions. Thus, consistent with the underlying pathogenesis of OSA, perioperative complications in these patients may be driven by upper airway obstruction. Recently, Ramachandran et al showed that OSA was an independent predictor of respiratory complications and unplanned intubation after general anesthesia. Another potential hazard associated with the use of general anesthesia is the frequent need for neuromuscular blockade. As described in Section 2.1, studies suggest that patients with OSA who received NMDA may be at increased risk for effects of residual neuromuscular blockade and respiratory failure compared to the general population. Therefore, the use of regional anesthesia may offer advantages by virtue of avoiding upper airway effects, although the potential for the need to convert to general anesthesia should always be considered. Neural stimulation appears to be essential in initiating the surgical catabolic stress response, and regional anesthesia utilizing local anesthetics seems to reliably block this effect. Given the evidence suggesting potential OSA-related alterations in pain perception and opioid potency due to intermittent hypoxia and sleep fragmentation, as discussed in Section 2.2, regional anesthesia confers benefits by providing effective pain relief while reducing opioid requirement, a key factor to consider in patients with OSA. In summary, despite the lack of high-quality RCTs, some evidence suggests a higher risk of complications with general compared to regional anesthesia in patients with OSA (Oxford LOE 2\u20134). Thus, regional anesthesia should be considered by anesthesiologists whenever feasible.", "type": "Document"}

This particularly applies to difficult intubation, difficult mask ventilation, or both. Data on the placement of supraglottic airway devices are scarce, but available evidence does not suggest a difference between patients with and without OSA. Adequate difficult airway management precautions should be taken in patients with OSA.Anesthetic and analgesic drugs can interact with or impact consciousness, sleep, upper airway anatomy and physiology, arousal responses, muscle activation, and ventilatory drive, potentially increasing perioperative risk in patients with OSA.In patients with OSA, the utilization of NMBA may confer an increased risk for the effects of residual neuromuscular blockade, postoperative respiratory failure, or hypoxemia. Residual neuromuscular blockade could be a driver of the higher incidence of respiratory complications in OSA. While neuromuscular blocking reversal agents can decrease postoperative residual paralysis and respiratory complications, current evidence does not favor any specific neuromuscular reversal agent with regard to outcome.Given the respiratory depressant effects of opioids, patients with OSA may be at increased risk for respiratory complications from the use of these analgesic drugs. Furthermore, chronic intermittent hypoxia and habitual sleep fragmentation may increase pain perception and augment opioid potency in OSA. These factors should be considered when administering opioids to patients with OSA.Patients with OSA receiving propofol for procedural sedation may be at increased risk for respiratory compromise and hypoxemic events. In the absence of certainty regarding dosing and scalar adjustments to concomitant use of other drugs and potential concurrent obesity, the utilization of propofol sedation in OSA requires a heightened level of vigilance as well as careful monitoring and titration to achieve desired effects.There is a lack of evidence on residual effects and anesthesia recovery profiles of inhalational agents and intravenous propofol specifically for the population with OSA. However, evidence in patients with obesity, a population with a high prevalence of OSA, indicates a potential superiority of sevoflurane and desflurane compared to intravenous propofol with regard to emergence and recovery from anesthesia. Comparing sevoflurane and desflurane, the latter has been associated with improved anesthesia recovery in patients with obesity.Evidence on the impact of ketamine specifically in OSA is largely lacking; however, adverse events such as psychiatric effects, sympathetic system activation, and hypersalivation, as usually observed in the general population during utilization of high doses, likely translate to OSA as well. Notably, however, emerging evidence indicates a potentially favorable impact of ketamine over other sedatives with regard to preservation of upper airway and ventilatory function.Despite the scarcity of data on the comparative effectiveness of intravenous benzodiazepine sedation among patients with and without OSA, intravenous benzodiazepines are known to and are purposefully utilized to induce upper airway collapse for diagnostic purposes of OSA. Thus, the procedure of intravenous benzodiazepine sedation may be associated with airway compromise in OSA.The potentially favorable respiratory profile and analgesic-sparing effects of \u03b1-2 agonists may render these drugs beneficial to the population with OSA. However, current literature on the effect of \u03b1-2 agonists in patients with OSA is limited and provides heterogeneous results. Thus, despite the detection of trends in statistical outcomes for some cardiorespiratory parameters, the clinical relevance of these findings remains unclear.Evidence on the comparative effectiveness of general versus regional anesthesia in the context of OSA is sparse. Nevertheless, the limited evidence in patients with OSA indicates a higher risk of complications with general compared to regional anesthesia. When feasible, regional anesthesia may confer advantages such as avoidance of upper airway effects and neuromuscular blockade, effective pain management, reduced opioid consumption, and efficient suppression of the systemic stress response. These features may be of benefit to patients with OSA. Given these findings and in the absence of evidence suggesting a disadvantage of regional anesthesia, the utilization of these techniques should be considered preferable over general anesthesia whenever feasible.

This brings an anticipated increase in the prevalence of chronic pain and with this comes the challenge of assessment of pain in many varied settings. Our first iteration of this document was published in 2007. But there has been a proliferation of literature and research since then, so we have developed a new set of guidelines.Different patterns and sites of pain were seen in men and women.Age differences suggest that pain prevalence increased with age up to 85 years and then decreased.The available studies on barriers and attitudes to pain management point towards an adherence to bio-medically orientated beliefs about pain, concern amongst clinicians in relation to activity recommendations, and a negative orientation in general towards patients with chronic painful conditions.A multidisciplinary approach to the assessment and treatment of pain is essential, but the assessment is a complex process which is hampered by many communication issues, including cognitive ability and socio-cultural factors. Such issues are part of the UK ageing population.Structured pain education should be implemented that provides all health professionals (whether professionally or non-professionally trained) with standardised education and training in the assessment and management of pain according to level of experience.Although subjective, patient self-report is the most valid and reliable indicator of pain and it may be necessary to ask questions about pain in different ways in order to elicit a response.A number of valid and reliable self-report measures are available and can be used even when moderate dementia exists. The Numerical Rating Scale or verbal descriptors can be used with people who have mild to moderate cognitive impairment. For people with severe cognitive impairment Pain in Advanced Dementia (PAINAD) and Doloplus-2 are recommended.PAINAD and Doloplus-2 scales continue to show positive results in terms of reliability and validity. There has been no recent evaluation of the Abbey pain scale although it is widely used throughout the UK.There is a need for more research into pain assessment using the collaborative role of the multidisciplinary team in all care settings.Self-report questionnaires of function are limited in their ability to capture the fluctuations in capacity and ability. The concentration on items of relevance to the population of interest means that issues of personal relevance can be obscured.Strong associations were seen between pain and depressed mood with each being a risk factor for the other. Additionally, loneliness and social isolation were associated with an increased risk of pain.Clinicians should be cognisant that social isolation and or depressive signs and symptoms may be indicators of pre-existing pain or a predictor of future pain onset.There are a number of evidence based guidelines on pain assessment in older people with or without cognitive impairment from around the world, including Australia and Europe.", "type": "Document"}

The prevalence of pain has been established to be in the order of one in four of the adult population, with between 25\u201330% having pain that leads to other co-morbidities, resulting in a very poor quality of life. These problems become more frequent with advancing years, and are often associated with difficulty in conveying the intensity and quality of the pain, as well as the impact that it has on the patient\u2019s life. As we describe pain as the \u2018fifth vital sign\u2019 a fundamental principal underpinning this is that we should measure the pain alongside routine observations. Just because someone does not have the ability to tell us that they have pain in a language that we can understand, does not mean that we should not measure it, as we would with any other adult or patient in our care. These guidelines provide a range of tools which demonstrate good validity and reliability for clinical practice in assessing pain in older people. There is permission to use them and so they should be implemented from this formal documentation by all healthcare providers in every care setting across the UK.", "type": "Document"}

Pain is frequently an especially important issue for very frail older people, including those living in care homes, and people living with dementia frequently experience pain which they find difficult to express. Hence pain and its management is a hugely important issue for older people. In 2007 we published the first national pain assessment guidelines which was a collaboration between the British Pain Society and the British Geriatrics Society. This document is a new version of the guidance and has taken a thorough and systematic approach to reviewing the literature which has been read and graded by a group of experts representing both societies; clinical practice and academia have been combined thereby ensuring a high quality and up-to-date best evidence document which can be used to guide practice and future research. This is a timely document and the guidance therein will be welcomed by practitioners around the UK.", "type": "Document"}

Pain is described as an \u2018unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage or described in terms of such damage\u2019 [ Millions of people who live in the United Kingdom experience chronic pain and as we go into older age, it is suggested that up to 93% of people have pain which is often \u2018expected to be part of ageing\u2019 or something that they have to \u2018learn to live with\u2019. One of the fundamental issues regarding pain management in any age group is assessment of pain. This can be particularly challenging in older adults due to the age related changes in vision, hearing and cognition. Literature has suggested in the past that we have around 50% of the older population who live in the community experiencing uncontrolled chronic pain. However, what is more worrying is the fact that this number increases significantly to 80% when we look at care home populations. This is really worrying considering that our oldest, often most frail, members of society often live in care homes and yet it appears that they are experiencing more moderate to severe uncontrolled pain. Furthermore, it seems accepted that this population are often cared for by the least experienced and non-professionally qualified members of staff. Recent systematic reviews of epidemiological studies suggest that the estimates of prevalence of chronic pain in the older population are not in fact accurate, and range from between 0 and 93% [ If we focus specifically on those who are unable to articulate their pain, thus adults with dementia or other cognitive impairments, we estimate that we have over 700,000 people in the UK with dementias and this is expected to rise significantly. Over the next few years we expect there to be 44 million people worldwide with dementia. As far back as September 1990 [th vital sign.

Derek Jones Research into beliefs which are of an ontological nature is limited. Investigation into \u2018just world\u2019 beliefs indicated that older participants had stronger beliefs in a personal and general just world and experienced less pain, disability and psychological distress. The influence of spiritual/religious beliefs (and coping) has been the subject of more investigation but with mixed findings regarding positive outcomes for different elements of the pain experience; cultural differences need particular consideration. Stoicism has been implicated in the underreporting of pain in older people, although pain related stoicism has been subjected to limited empirical investigation. There is some evidence from qualitative and quantitative research to support the existence of age related differences in attitudes of stoicism in the face of pain, its role in influencing pain reporting, and in mediating the chronic pain experience in general. A bio psychosocial model of pain and a cognitive behavioural approach to its management highlight, in particular, the potentially important roles of the attitudes and beliefs of informal caregivers and professionals in mediating the pain experience. There has been little research conducted into the attitudes and beliefs of these groups; the evidence that does exist suggests that reduced function and increased psychological distress are related to maladaptive spousal beliefs about pain. Whilst investigation of health and social care professionals\u2019 attitudes has been more extensive, it has focused on attitudes and beliefs in relation to working age populations and low back pain. It has also suffered from a lack of conceptual clarity, has not differentiated between cancer and non-cancer pain, and is limited by the absence of well-established robust measures. The available studies point towards an adherence to bio medically orientated beliefs about pain, a degree of fear-avoidance amongst clinicians in relation to activity recommendations, and a negative orientation to chronic pain patients in general.

Carlos Moreno-Leguizamon and Pat Schofield The literature on pain in older people acknowledges the fact that the process of communication between those in pain and their care givers, either professionals or family, is a complex and difficult process to be grasped. In this context the strong tendency in the literature is to generate tools, mainly scales, which would contribute to an effective diagnosis, expression, assessment and management of chronic pain. Some studies have focused on legitimising the validity and reliability of those scales [ A second emerging trend in the literature reviewed is to recommend the inclusion of a more comprehensive concept of communication, which includes important and complementary components such as nonverbal communication (facial expressions), kinesics (body movement), and proxemics (use of space) [ In the particular case of those with pain in advanced age, with cognitive impairments or from different cultural backgrounds, the process of communication by caregivers becomes even more complex and uncertain. This is because caregivers face more challenges in grasping the process of communication, the consequence of which is that the probability for those in pain to be undertreated or underdiagnosed becomes higher. Jorge and McDonald [ The issue we face in the United Kingdom, given the limitation of time for consultation, is that it is difficult for health care professionals to spend time on discussion or consultation. We need not only to understand how the communication process works between vulnerable groups and their caregivers (professional or family), but also to realise that pain is more than mere biology; it is also a bio-psychological (subjective) and social force [ Finally, while discussing the issue of a multidisciplinary team, Boorsma et al.

Jonathon Davies and Sonia Cottom Assessing pain in older adults is complex ([Level III-2) and in many cases, a lack of caregiver ([Level III-2; van Herk et al. [Level III-2) and family knowledge ([Level III-1) results in half of those living in pain continuing to do so ([Level III-2) for longer than necessary, due to a lack of early detection ([Level III-1). This failure effectively to identify and manage pain results in a reduced quality of life ([Level III-2) and impacts negatively on interpersonal relationships between the older person and the caregiver due to the association between pain and increased aggression ([Level IV; Bradford et al. [Level III-2). For specific groups, such as communicative or non-communicative nursing home residents, pain is often not detected ([Level III-1) and older people with cognitive impairment have reported more intense pain than their cognitively intact counterparts ([Level II). Also, due to the difficulties dementia patients have in communicating their pain, they are at far more risk of being untreated with pharmacological treatments than those without dementia ([Level III-2). It has been suggested that approaches to measuring pain should be multi-dimensional ([Level III-2) including attempts of self-reported pain for seniors with mild to moderate dementia ([Level III-2). Structured pain education should become a standard training ([Level II), including for nursing assistants ([Level III-2), to support caregivers in correctly assessing chronic pain in older people and learning how to alleviate it through pharmacological ([Level III-2) and non-pharmacological interventions ([Level IV). Pain assessment tools should be congruent with the educational levels of those being asked to complete them ([Level IV) and further training to understand verbal and non-verbal communication ([Level III-1) particularly when working with patients with dementia ([Level III-2) should be provided.

Felicia Cox and Karin Cannons The literature search was limited to English language papers only. Key search terms included: guidelines, pain assessment, older people, self-report. In addition, citations and references in selected journal articles were screened to supplement the search strategy.86 papers were identified73 once duplicates were removed47 papers were considered relevant to the aim of the review. These were read to identify studies and review publications that described pain assessment that employs patient self-report in older people. The majority of papers were from the US (n = 22) with 15 from Europe, four from Australia, three from the UK, two from Canada and one from Brazil. Over 30 different pain assessment tools were described in the included literature. A range of settings were explored including palliative care/inpatient hospice, acute post-operative ward, and long-term nursing home. Most studies explored the accuracy and clinical utility of self-report measures in older patients with and without cognitive impairment. The most accurate and reliable evidence of the existence of pain and its intensity is the patient\u2019s self-report ([Level III-2, Phillips [Level II, Leong et al. [Level IV). That the patient self-report is the most reliable and accurate is true even for patients with impaired cognition [ Identifying appropriate words that elicit meaningful responses and consistently using this language supported by communication tools is an important part of the comprehensive assessment of a patient\u2019s pain. Older people often deny pain, but may respond positively when asked using related terms, such as soreness, aching or discomfort. Re-wording your question to elicit the presence of pain such as \u2018Do you hurt anywhere?\u2019 or \u2018What is stopping you from doing what you want to do?\u2019 can substantiate the presence or absence of pain. The strategies employed to identify the presence or absence of pain that have been successful for this individual patient should be clearly recorded in the patient\u2019s care record and Hospital Passport. Behaviours that might indicate unrelieved pain such as vocalising, postures and gestures are also important ([Level IV) and should be included. This information must be communicated to the care team. Using a self-report pain measurement tool for a patient with known cognitive, sensory, or motor deficits can be useful. There are a number of validated and reliable tools and the choice of tool should be based on the patient\u2019s ability to use the tool. Many patients with moderate to severe cognitive impairment are able to report pain reliably when prompted [Level II). By employing the same tool at each pain assessment or using standardised wording during a pain discussion the clinician/carer can elicit a more reliable measure of the effectiveness of any pain interventions. Training and education in the selection of appropriate tools and their use in pain assessment is required ([Level III, McAuliffe et al. [ One of the key features of facilitating an effective pain assessment or conversation is to ensure that sufficient time is allowed for the older adult to process the question and to formulate a response. Instructing the patient with cognitive impairment on the use of the pain assessment tool each time it is administered can be helpful. Patients that have sensory deficits may require adjustments such as the tool provided in a more accessible format e.g. enlarged font or enhanced lighting.", "type": "Document"}

Nurses\u2019 pain assessment skills can also be a potential problem as registered nurses\u2019 assessment of pain is seemingly more reliable than that of nursing assistants ([Level I, Yi-Heng et al.

The lack of a comprehensive standardized care pathway compromises the appropriate management of FBSS patients, which is associated with a heavy financial burden. An international panel of spine surgeons, neurosurgeons, and pain specialists with a particular interest in FBSS established the chronic back and leg pain (CBLP) network with the aim of addressing the challenges and barriers in the clinical management of FBSS patients by building a common transdisciplinary vision. Based on literature reviews, additional input from clinical expertise of multiple professional disciplines, and consensus among its members, the network attempted to provide recommendations on the management of patients with FBSS utilizing a multidisciplinary team (MDT) approach. The presentation of this work has been divided in two separate parts to enhance its clarity. This first paper, in favour of selecting appropriate validated tools to improve the FBSS patient assessment, focuses on FBSS taxonomy and its clinical implications for evaluation. Concise recommendations for assessment, treatment, and outcome evaluation using a MDT approach would be an important resource for specialists and nonspecialist clinicians who manage patients with FBSS, to improve decision-making, reduce variation in practice, and optimize treatment outcomes in this difficult-to-treat population.", "type": "Document"}

Invitations were sent to potential participants and accepted prior to formal engagement. Formal face-to-face meetings were held annually between 2012 and 2016 with subsequent teleconferences for an additional feedback prior to drafting the manuscript. The meetings were chaired by a trained facilitator to help the consensus process.Literature searches in PubMed, MEDLINE, LILACS, Embase, and the National Guideline Clearing House were conducted by two separate reviewers: one independent reviewer (GB) and one reviewer on the behalf of the clinical group (NN), on a regular basis up to September 2018, without any restrictions regarding language or year of publication. The search strategy was developed in order to maximise sensitivity of article identification, using controlled vocabulary and title/abstract words combining variations of \u201cFailed back surgery syndrome,\u201d \u201cBack pain,\u201d \u201cChronic leg pain\u201d with \u201cMultidisciplinary\u201d OR \u201cTeam,\u201d \u201cClinical pathway\u201d OR \u201cPractice guideline\u201d OR \u201cAlgorithm\u201d OR \u201cGuideline\u201d OR \u201cProtocol,\u201d detailed here after.

Key words and terms pertaining to the condition (i.e., \u201cfailed back surgery syndrome,\u201d \u201clow back pain,\u201d and \u201cleg pain\u201d) were cross referenced with terms pertaining to reports presenting recommendations for MDT involvement in management (i.e., \u201cinterdisciplinary communication,\u201d \u201cmultidisciplinary\u201d OR \u201cmultidisciplinary team\u201d OR \u201cmultidisciplinary care\u201d OR \u201cpatient referral\u201d) in relevant combinations. Handsearching of reference lists of identified reports and relevant review articles were also carried out.

Discussion\nUse of the term FBSS has provoked decades of controversy because of a lack of consensus of a definition and the inherently restrictive and confusing meaning of this acronym. The term hides the challenges associated with selecting appropriate treatment for this patient population due to insufficient identification of the underlying mechanism of pain [ In response to the limitations of current practice in managing FBSS patients, an international panel of spine surgeons, neurosurgeons, and pain specialists with a special interest in FBSS established the CBLP network. Based on the broad personal experience of each member of the panel, through literature reviews, additional input from clinical expertise of multiple professional disciplines and consensus among its members, the CBLP network's primary intention is to provide recommendations on how to optimize the management and outcomes of FBSS. In this paper, we focus on the key elements for defining FBSS and outline how to clinically confirm this diagnosis. The CBLP network's definition of FBSS is found on the prediction that no further spine surgery is indicated after adequate somatic, psychosocial, and radiological assessment have been executed. Management begins with a systematic evaluation of common FBSS aetiologies. Appropriate understanding and identification of the abnormalities most commonly associated with FBSS after a meticulous clinical evaluation is required for adequate caretaking of this often hard-to-treat condition [ For many aspects of medical practice, there is a lack of high-quality evidence and a plethora of contradictory information which makes decision-making difficult when trying to optimize treatment outcomes and provide concise recommendations for assessment, treatment, and outcome evaluation.

We did not expect that for the large field of OA only a few European guidelines existed. The extent of the available documents also differed largely. In 1966, Donabedian proposed that healthcare quality could be measured by considering the structure, the process and the outcomes of care. In addition to pharmacological treatment, non-pharmacological methods delivered by health professionals such as physiotherapists, occupational therapists and specialists for physical medicine and rehabilitation are necessary. However, while the importance given to non-pharmacological treatment is reflected in the guidelines, high-quality evidence, except for knee OA, is scarce. This could be a result of the difficulty of conducting and funding high-quality randomised controlled trials for non-pharmacological treatments and because OA might not be seen as a high priority in funding institutions. Thus, further research in this area is urgently required to assess the evidence for these interventions. The focus of the eumusc.net project was to investigate the musculoskeletal health status in Europe (in work-package 4), to develop SOC (in work-package 5), Quality Indicators (in work-package 6) The SOC for OA have been developed according to the process that was used for the development of the SOC for rheumatoid arthritis. The aim of this initiative was to provide a set of questions that patients could use in the consultation of health professionals to facilitate the discussion of the treatment. While a strength of our study is the provision of consensus based information concerning OA worded in a way that can be easily understood by lay persons including patients, our study also has several limitations: we restricted the included guidelines to those available in English and German language only, we did not conduct an empirical testing and we did not re-evaluate the evidence base of the guidelines. Even if the interventions were retrieved from the guidelines, the wording of the SOC was a consensus within the expert group including the expertise of the patient partners. Also, we did not address OA of the spine, as back pain is different from peripheral joint OA and has a different diagnosis and therapy. It was not the scope of the project to examine the economical feasibility and the validity of the SOC. Further research is suggested to explore these areas. Finally, implementation could not yet be assessed so far. To evaluate this implementation, in another work package, Health Care Quality Indicators have been developed. The SOC should be a minimum standard for all European countries and, ideally, ought to be implemented as soon as possible, but not later than by the year 2020 according to the aims of this European Union project. Furthermore, they are meant to be a resource for interested persons. The checklist presented should give persons without a professional background the ability to clarify what appropriate care is and to facilitate the discussion of the treatment options with their health professionals. With this work, we hope to promote more unification of the treatment of OA throughout Europe. In summary, in order to improve quality of care in patients with OA, service providers, support groups, policy-makers, patients and health professionals themselves should work together to develop a framework for managing OA. This framework should take account of the chronicity of this disorder and the current changing environment for the delivery of healthcare. This set of SOC will help achieve this goal.\n", "type": "Document"}

Most have failed to sufficiently examine and objectively establish OSA as a perioperative risk factor. Moreover, few have focused on an objective assessment of how to identify patients with OSA. An example is provided by the ASA Practice Guideline for the Perioperative Management of Patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea, which was published in 2014, updating their 2006 guideline. It recommends preoperative screening to identify undiagnosed OSA, preoperative initiation of CPAP therapy for OSA where possible, and postoperative monitoring of OSA patients. However, despite best intentions, a significant dilemma occurs because these broadly based recommendations are factored on limited evidence, and the cost of implementation is high. Given this problem, a more focused and practical approach is needed to balance the desire to reduce postoperative adverse events and improve long-term health benefits with appropriate allocation of health care resources.", "type": "Document"}

In doing so, it carefully examines the existing evidence-base for preoperative screening and preparation of patients with OSA, as well as the perioperative use of CPAP in patients with diagnosed or undiagnosed OSA. The Task Force recognizes the difficulties posed by late recognition of OSA during preoperative workup, and thus, the recommendations provide a practical balance between the desire to minimize postoperative complications and the requirement for efficient use of health care resources. To enhance the value of these guidelines for treating physicians, we have categorized patients into 3 clinically relevant groups: diagnosed OSA, treated; diagnosed OSA, partially treated/untreated; and suspected OSA. The ASA 2014 guideline does not make these distinctions, thus limiting its utility in the clinical setting.

The recommendation strength was classified as either \u201cstrong\u201d or \u201cweak.\u201d Recommendations were made to administer or not administer an intervention based on trade-offs between benefits on the one hand and downsides (harms, burden, and cost) on the other. A strong recommendation was given to administer an intervention or offer a treatment if the desirable effects of an outcome or an intervention clearly outweigh the undesirable effects. Conversely, if downsides outweigh benefits, the guideline will recommend against the implementation of such a treatment. If the overall effects were uncertain, a weak recommendation, also known as conditional, discretionary or qualified recommendation was given. Essentially, a weak recommendation indicates that the desirable effects of adherence probably outweigh the undesirable effects. In addition, the weak assessment rating was assigned if evidence was of low quality or evidence indicated that both desirable and undesirable effects were evenly present. Both strong and weak recommendations have a direction: either for or against. In some instances, while the level of evidence was low due to the absence of published literature, there was strong support for the statement by consensus of experts.

Question: Does a Diagnosis of OSA Change Postoperative Outcomes? > Recommendation 1.1.1: Patients With a Diagnosis of OSA Should Be Considered to Be at Increased Risk for Perioperative Complications (Level of Evidence: Moderate. Grade of Recommendation: Strong for)\nThe notion that OSA negatively affects postoperative outcomes is held widely among perioperative physicians; however, prospective, controlled studies with sufficient power to support this assumption are rare, and randomization may not be feasible. In recent years, 2 independent meta-analyses have evaluated studies comparing outcomes in patients with and without a diagnosis of OSA and concluded that such a diagnosis is associated with increased risk for postoperative complications. Cardiopulmonary adverse events were increased by 2- to 3-fold. Nevertheless, these analyses used fairly strict inclusion criteria, resulting in the inclusion of 13 and 17 studies only, respectively. Additional literature available on the topic was not considered in these meta-analyses, including recent analyses generated from data collected in large national databases on millions of patients. Although the accuracy of studies that use International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) coding to identify patients with OSA in Canada has been recently criticized, the point of the critique might not be applicable to other databases, and separate validation would be necessary to verify sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, potential deficiencies of coding systems in OSA identification would label a mixture of OSA and non-OSA patients with the diagnosis of OSA, and potential misclassification would bias results to the null. Considering the fact that patients with an ICD-9 code of OSA are likely to have the disease, and many who remain undiagnosed are included in the control group as is likely the case in database studies, the associations found in these analyses could actually underestimate the true effects. The SASM Task Force on preoperative screening and assessment of patients with OSA sought to perform a comprehensive evaluation of the available information to formulate an opinion on the question: \u201cDoes the diagnosis of OSA change postoperative outcomes?\u201d This is of utmost importance because it forms the basis for clinical decision making regarding OSA in the perioperative setting and allows for the allocation of appropriate resources toward the prevention of adverse outcomes. Studies were reviewed irrespective of OSA definition and included those basing identification using ICD-9 coding, polysomnography, chart diagnosis and sleep questionnaires. Analyses that used data from population-based administrative databases were also included because these reported on large numbers of patients and are powered to investigate rare outcomes. No meta-analysis was performed, however, as the pooling of data from database studies has the possibility of case-overlap with other such investigations. The systematic review on the impact of OSA on postoperative outcomes was published by the group separately. It should be mentioned that additional studies have been published on the topic after the literature search was performed, further supporting the concept of OSA as a perioperative risk factor for complications. The literature on postoperative complications consists primarily of observational studies, and the majority of publications support the notion that the presence of OSA negatively influences perioperative outcomes. OSA may negatively affect respiratory outcomes and may be linked to postoperative cardiovascular events, such as the development of atrial fibrillation. Although speculative, commonly found comorbid conditions such as pulmonary hypertension and heart disease may contribute to these findings, suggesting that cardiac in addition to respiratory monitoring for selected patients with OSA may be considered. The literature on the association between OSA and perioperative mortality is less clear. Current data suggest an association between OSA and lower 30-day mortality. The studies reporting a reduced association of the perioperative mortality with OSA are based on population-based database analyses with residual confounding, dependence on ICD-9 diagnosis of OSA, and an inability to determine causality. It is therefore plausible that increased vigilance afforded to patients with OSA by care providers may reduce fatal outcomes as a result of complications, without influencing the latter per se. In view of ethical considerations, it is now difficult to perform randomized controlled trials in patients with OSA to determine its associations with postoperative complications, particularly in patients with severe OSA. Because of the large number of patients and the large number of trials, the overall quality of the body of evidence was considered to be moderate using the GRADE approach.", "type": "Document"}

Eleven studies based the diagnosis of OSA on ICD-9 coding, 18 used polysomnography, 6 used chart diagnoses, 16 used screening questionnaires, and 1 study referred to \u201cclinical diagnosis.\u201d In total, the included studies reported on 413 576 OSA patients (diagnosed by ICD-9 coding, polysomnography, chart or clinical diagnoses, and screening questionnaires) and 8 557 044 control (non-OSA) patients. In summary, 17 studies reported on pulmonary complications, 14 on oxygen desaturation events, 6 on difficult intubation, 11 on cardiac complications, 6 on atrial fibrillation, 11 on varying composite outcomes of minor/major complications, 19 on the utilization of resources, 4 on various other outcomes, and 13 on the outcome of mortality. In only 7 studies was OSA associated with a beneficial effect for one of the outcomes studied. The level of evidence to judge the impact of OSA on various outcomes ranged from very low to moderate.

Regarding mortality, 9 of 13 studies reported no association, 3 reported lower mortality in the OSA group, and 1 study reported an increase in mortality among OSA patients. The only study reporting increased mortality was a population-based database study, which found an association between diagnosis of OSA by ICD-9 code and increased mortality in patients undergoing revision knee or hip arthroplasties.

Question: Should Adult Patients at Risk for OSA Be Identified Before Surgery? > Recommendation 2.1.1: Adult Patients at Risk for OSA Should Be Identified Before Surgery (Level of Evidence: Low, Grade of Recommendation: Weak for)\nRoutine preoperative screening for OSA in patients presenting for surgery may identify the majority of the patients with OSA and may provide opportunities for heightened awareness and potential risk reduction by implementing appropriate preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative interventions. The prevalence of patients at risk of OSA (STOP-Bang \u22653) in the surgical population is high. When compared with patients with STOP-Bang scores of 0 to 2 (low-risk OSA), surgical patients with STOP-Bang scores of \u22653 had an increased rate of perioperative complications. This may justify the use of a screening tool to risk stratify high-risk OSA patients. A screening tool may help the perioperative team to establish a strategy to reduce the risk of perioperative complications. Practice groups should consider making OSA screening part of standard preanesthetic evaluation. Although patients identified to be at high risk for OSA have been shown to have increased perioperative complications, only a small proportion of them will be affected, because the modest specificity of current screening tools means that many patients identified as \u201cat risk\u201d for OSA may not have the disease. Second, not all that do will be at increased risk beyond emergence from anesthesia because of the low-risk nature of their procedure. Third, the OSA phenotype and the severity of OSA may play an additional role. Although the ultimate goal is to minimize risk of postoperative complication as much as feasible by ensuring that every patient with suspected OSA is identified, it is clear that such an approach will result in a challenging logistical, economic, and clinical burden for healthcare providers. Hence, a balance has to be struck between the desire to minimize postoperative complications and the responsible use of resources. The realistic goal is to risk stratify those at particular risk and suggest methods to prevent or treat problems without creating undue economic burden on the health care system. There is some supporting evidence to suggest that identifying OSA in certain patient populations, such as morbidly obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery or obstetric patients with high-risk pregnancies, may be useful. Given the adverse maternal, fetal, and perioperative complications associated with OSA, prompt diagnosis and treatment of OSA is critical in the obstetric population. Although not all obstetric patients are at high risk for OSA, several prospective studies suggest that pregnant women with preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes, asthma, body mass index (BMI) \u226535 kg/m2, greater prepregnancy BMI, and excessive weight gain during pregnancy place obstetric patients at high-risk for OSA. Unfortunately, screening tools appear less accurate and have not been validated in the obstetric population, and currently, there are no pregnancy-specific guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of OSA. With the lack of evidence, the best option is to extrapolate the perioperative evaluation and management approach recommended for other patients with diagnosed or suspected OSA to the obstetric population. Fifty percent of the patients with severe obesity (BMI \u226540 kg/m2) have been found to have OSA, and 10% to 20% of these have obesity hypoventilation syndrome. Patients with a BMI \u226540 kg/m2 have increased postoperative mortality and morbidity, especially from thromboembolic, infectious, and surgical complications. The risk further increases with the presence of OSA. Those at such substantial risk may be first identified by preoperative screening, using a questionnaire such as STOP-Bang. The STOP-Bang score has been validated in both obese and morbidly obese surgical patients. A STOP-Bang score of 4 has a high sensitivity of 88% for identifying patients with severe OSA, whereas increasing the cutoff threshold score to 6 increases the specificity for severe OSA (however at a lower sensitivity). Steps to identify those likely to have OSA among morbidly obese patients are becoming accepted practice before bariatric surgery. It is important to note that, at present, there is limited evidence supporting the use of preoperative screening tools for OSA as a practice to reduce patient complications. However, the expert recommendation for preoperative screening reflects a growing consensus that identifying patients at high risk for OSA before surgery for targeted perioperative precautions and interventions may help to reduce patient complications. For example, there is evidence supporting the avoidance of general anesthesia in patients with OSA who are undergoing specific procedures such as joint arthroplasty. An important public health implication of a preoperative OSA screening program is that it could improve the long-term health of patients through better OSA treatment and a reduction of the associated consequences. It is plausible that preoperative diagnosis and optimization of patients with OSA may lead to similar benefits as those achieved by perioperative diagnosis and treatment of other chronic diseases such as coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes. Undoubtedly, further research in this area is needed, including the development of equally sensitive but more specific screening tools than those that currently exist.", "type": "Document"}

Question: Which Tools Can Be Used to Identify Surgical Patients With Suspected OSA in the Preoperative Period? > Recommendation 2.2.1: Screening Tools Such As STOP-Bang,116 P-SAP,142 Berlin,62 and ASA Check List62 Can Be Used as Preoperative Screening Tools to Identify Patients With Suspected OSA (Level of Evidence: Moderate. Grade of Recommendation: Strong for)\nThe majority of OSA patients presenting for surgery are undiagnosed and lack sufficient time before surgery to undergo formal diagnostic preoperative polysomnography testing, making screening relevant to perioperative clinical care. Previous systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and guidelines have recommended preoperative OSA screening. However, with exception of the Society for Ambulatory Anesthesia guideline, they do not provide recommendations for specific screening tests based on diagnostic accuracy. The choice of screening test is further complicated by the fact that there are many different screening approaches including questionnaires and clinical models with additional screening techniques such as upper airway imaging and overnight oximetry. Furthermore, the majority of studies investigating screening for OSA are designed around higher risk populations (eg, sleep clinic populations), and many are not validated in surgical populations. The comparative accuracy of different clinical tests for OSA has been reviewed extensively. Specific screening tools are associated with significantly greater accuracy than others, but there is a large heterogeneity within each individual screening test. This means that any given screening tool will have varying accuracy across different populations and may not have the same accuracy when implemented in clinical practice. The 2 major considerations for choosing screening tests for OSA are feasibility and reliability. Because many patients presenting for surgery may be screened on the day of or within 1 to 2 days of surgery, and some within a few weeks before surgery, the most feasible tests are questionnaires or simple clinical models. Questionnaires are the most commonly used method and have modest accuracy, whereas clinical models that incorporate symptom review with simple clinical measurements are superior to questionnaires. Implementing the search strategy on screening, the initial electronic search yielded 9565 references (S3). After screening of titles, abstracts, and manuscripts, 9562 articles were excluded. Three pertinent publications addressing the issue of screening of surgical patients for OSA with validation by laboratory polysomnography were identified. The STOP-Bang tool, P-SAP score, Berlin questionnaire, and ASA checklist are screening tests that were evaluated in the surgical population and found to have comparable accuracy (Table The STOP-Bang tool is the most validated screening tool in surgical patients and also has been validated in sleep clinic patients and the general population to detect patients at high risk of OSA. In surgical patients, a greater STOP-Bang score is associated with a greater probability of moderate-to-severe OSA. A combination of a STOP score \u2265 2 + BMI > 35 kg/m2 or male sex is associated with a greater risk of OSA. The inverse relationship between sensitivity and specificity at increasing STOP-Bang diagnostic thresholds influences the relative rates of missed diagnoses and wasted resource utilization in diagnosing OSA. It is also important to recognize that the predictive values of the tool will be lower in many preoperative settings that have lower prevalence of OSA. Despite these limitations, the updated STOP-Bang tool adds clinical value to the preoperative assessment as it provides a relatively easy method of dichotomous risk stratification of high or low risk of OSA. Other screening tools such as the P-SAP score also perform like the STOP-Bang tool when increasing the test threshold, with similar implications for missed diagnoses and resource utilization. Local practices should decide about the threshold of screening tests, after considering the implications for missed diagnoses and cost of care. The trade-off between sensitivity and specificity means that at lower thresholds, groups should expect improved sensitivity with potentially increased resource utilization, whereas increasing the threshold will result in loss of sensitivity and increased false-negative rates but improved resource utilization. A higher threshold should be adopted in the population with a lower prevalence of OSA. Because no single test has perfect sensitivity and specificity, there will be varying proportions of false positives and false negatives with any screening program. It is perhaps relevant to consider that a preoperative 12-lead electrocardiogram has <50% sensitivity for the detection of left ventricular hypertrophy and acute myocardial infarction. More advanced screening tests for OSA with greater prediction accuracy have been validated in the literature, but their complexity and applicability in the surgical population are yet to be evaluated. Currently, there is inadequate evidence in the literature to recommend the use of sleep testing such as polysomnography in the preoperative period. A future area in need of clarification regarding preoperative screening for OSA is its timing in context of the surgical date. Although experts acknowledged the challenges involved, there was agreement that the greatest opportunity for preoperative diagnosis and treatment would come only with a more deliberate push toward earlier screening. Primary care providers and surgeons should share responsibility for early identification of OSA in patients who are scheduled for surgery as this would allow more time to optimize preoperative preparation. This could involve clinic-based screening at the initial surgical visit.", "type": "Document"}

BEST PREOPERATIVE PRACTICES IN PATIENTS WHO ARE DIAGNOSED WITH OSA, NONADHERENT WITH PRESCRIBED THERAPY, OR HAVE A HIGH PRETEST PROBABILITY FOR OSA\nBecause OSA remains undiagnosed in the majority of surgical patients, many patients will be identified as having a high probability for OSA for the first time during the preoperative screening process. In addition, many patients with an established diagnosis of OSA either refuse to use or are poorly adherent with the prescribed therapy. As discussed herein, there are limited data to suggest that preoperative positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy, in the form of CPAP, autotitrated positive airway pressure (APAP), or bilevel positive airway pressure may improve perioperative outcomes. Alternative therapies used to treat OSA, such as surgery, oral appliances, negative pressure devices, hypoglossal nerve stimulation, positional therapies, nasal resistive valves, and other treatments have not been studied systematically in the perioperative setting, although some patients may be using these as primary therapy for their OSA. Ideally, identification of patients with OSA, whether adherent or nonadherent to therapy, and those with suspected OSA should take place well in advance of elective surgery to allow time for potential evaluation and management of OSA preoperatively. In clinical practice, many patients, however, are identified close to the operative time, often just days before or even immediately before surgery. Because of a lack of evidence to guide clinical decision making, considerable uncertainty exists regarding the need for further preoperative interventions. The objective in this section is to provide recommendations for the optimal preoperative practices for the care of diagnosed or suspected OSA patients to reduce perioperative complications. We first examined the evidence of the efficacy of CPAP for surgical patients in the perioperative period. The recommendations are divided into 3 parts: (i) surgical patients with diagnosed OSA who are adherent to PAP therapy; (ii) surgical patients with diagnosed OSA who are nonadherent to PAP therapy; and (iii) surgical patients with a high probability for having OSA. It should be noted that because there is limited literature on the best preoperative practices in patients with diagnosed or suspected OSA, some of the recommendations are based on data or evidence that is extrapolated from a nonsurgical setting.", "type": "Document"}

BEST PREOPERATIVE PRACTICES IN PATIENTS WHO ARE DIAGNOSED WITH OSA, NONADHERENT WITH PRESCRIBED THERAPY, OR HAVE A HIGH PRETEST PROBABILITY FOR OSA > 3.0 Evidence of the Efficacy of CPAP for Surgical Patients in the Perioperative Period\nPrevious guidelines have suggested that CPAP therapy should be considered preoperatively when OSA is severe; intraoperatively in patients under sedation if they have used CPAP previously; and postoperatively, when feasible, particularly if frequent or severe airway obstruction is evident during postoperative monitoring. A trade-off occurs when one considers the balance between potentially improved adverse events versus the increased utilization of health care resources resulting from additional interventions and monitoring. At present, <20% of patients with a diagnosis of OSA receive CPAP therapy, are observed in advanced care settings, or both in actual clinical practice. Implementing our search strategy on the use of perioperative CPAP, the initial electronic search identified 1970 articles (S4-7). After screening of the titles, abstracts, and manuscripts, 1964 articles were excluded. Six pertinent studies addressing the issue of surgical patients with OSA with or without CPAP were identified. Further citation search yielded 3 more relevant articles. The types of studies and the level of evidence are shown in Table In the 9 studies analyzed, the total number of OSA patients with either preoperative/postoperative CPAP therapy was 4380, and the total number of diagnosed or suspected OSA patients without preoperative/postoperative CPAP therapy was 3649. In patients with OSA, 9 studies demonstrated that CPAP applied preoperatively and/or postoperatively may have some beneficial effect on postoperative complications. These studies are mainly of low to moderate quality with 2 RCTs, 2 prospective cohorts, 4 retrospective matched cohorts, and 1 case series (Table In 2 studies, CPAP significantly reduced the postoperative AHI compared with the preoperative baseline (preoperative AHI versus postoperative AHI: 37 \u00b1 19 vs 12 \u00b1 16 events/h). A recent meta-analysis showed a trend toward significance for reduction in the length of hospital stay of 0.4 days favoring the CPAP group (CPAP versus no CPAP: 4.0 \u00b1 4 vs 4.4 \u00b1 8 days, P = .05). In addition to the studies noted previously, 2 recent large retrospective studies suggest potential efficacy of CPAP in patients with diagnosed OSA. In the first study, those patients diagnosed with OSA and provided with a prescription for CPAP therapy before their surgery had a significantly reduced risk for cardiovascular adverse events compared to patients with undiagnosed OSA (odds ratio [OR], 0.34; 95% confidence interval, 0.15\u20130.77; P = .009). Patients with severe OSA or undiagnosed OSA were found to have a significantly increased risk for cardiorespiratory complications. The second study found that untreated OSA patients had significantly greater cardiopulmonary complication rates compared to those with prescribed PAP therapy (risk-adjusted rates 6.7% vs 4%; adjusted OR = 1.8, P = .001). Both myocardial infarction (adjusted OR = 2.6, P = .031) and unplanned reintubations (adjusted OR = 2.5, P = .003) were significantly greater in untreated OSA patients. These 2 large database studies provide preliminary evidence supporting preoperative diagnosis of OSA and treatment with CPAP therapy. There are 3 studies, 2 prospective and 1 retrospective, on empiric APAP therapy in the perioperative care of patients with newly diagnosed untreated OSA. Each study reported a different primary outcome: perioperative AHI versus length of stay versus APAP adherence. None of the studies was sufficiently powered to address the impact of APAP on postoperative complications; and in one study, patients with suspected OSA who were at >10% risk for postoperative cardiac complications as estimated by American College of Physicians criteria were excluded if they had an abnormal overnight oximetry study. The adherence to APAP therapy in these studies was uniformly low. Approximately 45% of patients with newly diagnosed OSA were adherent to APAP therapy in the perioperative period.", "type": "Document"}

Evaluation and management of OSA by a practitioner with expertise in sleep medicine has been shown to reduce discontinuation of PAP therapy and improve PAP adherence. Sleep medicine specialists can investigate reasons for refusal of therapy or poor adherence to therapy in patients diagnosed with OSA and implement strategies to improve acceptance and/or adherence to PAP therapy.

Grade of Recommendation: Weak for)\nAs OSA is associated with numerous poor health outcomes including risk of death, cardiovascular events, and average number of days hospitalized, and treatment of OSA appears to improve these outcomes, it is clinically important to diagnose OSA in those patients screened at high risk, and for these patients to have ongoing, long-term management. Relevant to identifying patients in preoperative screening, a recent 2-year follow-up survey study found that patients diagnosed with OSA in the preoperative setting who were adherent to CPAP therapy experienced long-term health benefits and a reduction in medication usage. It should be recognized that questionnaires or other screening processes are imperfect diagnostic tools with low to moderate specificity. As such they tend to overdiagnose, with a significant proportion of patients labeled as at risk of OSA when they may not have the condition. It is important to differentiate between patients identified as at increased risk of having OSA and those who have been accurately diagnosed with OSA. If a patient is overdiagnosed or misdiagnosed as having OSA, this could have negative consequences in terms of any future surgical procedure, health insurance costs, and the ability to continue to drive. Accurate diagnosis is a necessary precursor to appropriate treatment. Conversely, ruling out OSA in patients who screened as at risk for OSA eliminates many of the negative consequences from overdiagnosis.

In view of the increased risk of perioperative complications associated with OSA, surgical safety for patients with OSA is a substantial concern on a global level. As of July 2015, the Joint Commission, Division of Health Care Improvement, had received 61 sentinel perioperative event reports in which a patient was diagnosed with or suspected of having OSA. The Joint Commission cited the following concerns regarding the perioperative care of patients in the setting of OSA: (1) lack of training for health care professionals to screen for and recognize OSA; (2) failure to assess patients for OSA; (3) lack of guidelines for the care and treatment of individuals at risk for and those diagnosed with OSA; (4) failure to implement appropriate monitoring of patients with risk factors associated with OSA; (5) lack of communication among health care providers regarding patients with OSA or potential risk factors associated with OSA; and (6) lack of postoperative evaluation and treatment for OSA. These are all areas waiting for further improvement. The primary goal of this SASM guideline is to ensure optimal preoperative evaluation of patients with diagnosed or suspected OSA to improve patient safety. There is now firm evidence that these patients are at increased risk of postoperative complications. Preoperative evaluation, best done in an anesthesia preoperative clinic, enhances anesthetic management of chronic medical conditions such as OSA through documentation of health status and, where appropriate, initiation of investigations to pursue diagnostic possibilities raised in the screening process including referral to appropriate subspecialists. Primary care providers and surgeons require education regarding the increased risk of postoperative complications present in diagnosed or undiagnosed OSA patients. They should be alert to the possibility of OSA in their patients and attempt to identify it early in the surgical planning process to allow optimal preoperative preparation and risk stratification. OSA is a heterogeneous disorder with multiple causes and different phenotypes. The clinical practice of sleep medicine is changing rapidly with wider availability of simple home-based diagnostics and more readily acceptable treatments. There is some evidence supporting the desirability of preoperative diagnosis of OSA and treatment with CPAP therapy. The time between the decision to perform surgery and the date of the surgery should allow for optimization of patient health, including identification and management of OSA where it exists. With proper training in sleep medicine, anesthesiologists may be able to diagnose and treat OSA in the perioperative setting. The overall costs of health care could be reduced by treating sleep apnea as the number of hospital admissions and their costs have been shown to be lower in OSA patients on CPAP versus no therapy. At present, we believe that there is insufficient evidence to support canceling or delaying surgery to perform sleep studies and to initiate PAP therapy in those patients identified as being at high risk of OSA preoperatively, unless there is evidence of significant or uncontrolled systemic disease. Additional subspecialty evaluation for preoperative cardiopulmonary optimization should be considered in patients who have a known diagnosis of OSA, are nonadherent to PAP therapy, and have uncontrolled systemic conditions such as hypoventilation, severe pulmonary hypertension, or resting hypoxemia in the absence of other known cardiopulmonary disease. These concerns may also apply to patients with suspected OSA who have these problems. These considerations make a case for fast track consultation and PAP therapy services, facilitating access to diagnosis and treatment for such patients. Regardless of whether the diagnosis of OSA was established before surgery or not, anesthesiologists, surgeons, and institutions should develop an institutional protocol for patients with known or suspected OSA, including type of anesthesia, choice of medications, postoperative analgesic regimens, monitoring, and appropriate preoperative/postoperative referral to reduce complications and to ensure the best possible patient outcome.", "type": "Document"}

The KSUR guideline development subcommittee constructed questionnaires assessing prebiopsy anticoagulation, the cleansing enema, antimicrobial prophylaxis, local anesthesia methods such as periprostatic neurovascular bundle block (PNB) or intrarectal lidocaine gel application (IRLA), opioid usage, and the number of biopsy cores and length and diameter of the biopsy needle. The survey was conducted using an Internet-based platform, and responses were solicited from the 90 members registered on the KSUR mailing list as of 2018. A comprehensive search of relevant literature from Medline database was conducted. The strength of each recommendation was graded on the basis of the level of evidence. Among the 90 registered members, 29 doctors (32.2%) responded to this online survey. Most KSUR members stopped anticoagulants (100%) and antiplatelets (76%) one week before the procedure. All respondents performed a cleansing enema before TRUS-Bx. Approximately 86% of respondents administered prophylactic antibiotics before TRUS-Bx. The most frequently used antibiotics were third-generation cephalosporins. PNB was the most widely used pain control method, followed by a combination of PNB plus IRLA. Opioids were rarely used (6.8%), and they were used only as an adjunctive pain management approach during TRUS-Bx. The KSUR members mainly chose the 12-core biopsy method (89.7%) and 18G 16-mm or 22-mm (96.5%) needles. The KSUR recommends the 12-core biopsy scheme with PNB with or without IRLA as the standard protocol for TRUS-Bx. Anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents should be discontinued at least 5 days prior to the procedure, and antibiotic prophylaxis is highly recommended to prevent infectious complications. Glycerin cleansing enemas and administration of opioid analogues before the procedure could be helpful in some situations.

Due to increasing clinical and scientific relevance, the guideline was expanded to include the topic area \u2018early mobilisation\u2019. \u2018Guidelines are systematically developed presentations and recommendations with the purpose of assisting physicians and patients in deciding on appropriate measures for medical care (prevention, diagnostics, therapy and after care) under specific medical conditions.\u2019 (Association of Scientific Medical Societies, AWMF). The guideline is based on the following fundamental assumptions:Guidelines for use in positioning therapy and early mobilisation in prophylaxis or therapy of pulmonary disorders aid in decision-making in specific situations. They are based on the current state of scientific knowledge and on procedures proven in practice.Positioning and early mobilisation are supporting concepts in the treatment and prophylaxis of pulmonary disorders, wherein they are intended to supplement basic medical measures (e.g. mechanical ventilation, fluid management, pharmacotherapy), but not to replace them.There is no single \u2018ideal\u2019 position for all pulmonary disorders; rather the positioning plan must be customised individually to the circumstances surrounding a patient and condition.A sharp distinction of the indication \u2018prophylaxis\u2019 versus \u2018therapy\u2019 is not possible for all eligible pulmonary disorders. As in other therapeutic fields, there is frequently a smooth transition between \u2018prophylaxis\u2019, \u2018early treatment\u2019 and \u2018therapy\u2019.On the basis of the present guideline, the majority of patients with pulmonary disorders should respond well to therapy in conjunction with a whole therapeutic plan.Effective teamwork, the introduction of practical algorithms and proper management of emergency situations are the requirement for the safe implementation of positioning methods and, in particular, for early mobilisation. In doing so, the integration of these concepts into everyday work procedures will lead to a routine course of action and increased experience.The use of positioning and early mobilisation throughout the duration of therapy requires the continual critical review of the indication and customisation to the individual progression of the disease.Objectives and methods of the treatment plan must be presented in a transparent manner for all involved (physicians, caregivers, physical therapists, relatives and, to the extent possible, the patient).", "type": "Document"}

The methodical approach of the guideline development process corresponds to the requirements for evidence-based medicine as they were defined by the AWMF as a standard. With respect to positioning, recently published papers were studied starting in 2005; the newly incorporated aspect of early mobilisation comprises all previously published literature up to and including 06/2014. The guideline was prepared in the following steps: Definition of the search terms for all topics of focus and determination of the relevant databases:Pulmonary disorders: (adult; acute) respiratory distress syndrome/ARDS, acute lung injury, severe lung injury, atelectasis, shock lung, acute respiratory failure, postoperative respiratory failure, lung failure, lung insufficiency, respiratory failure, respiratory insufficiency, ventilator-associated/induced lung injury, ventilator-associated/induced pneumonia, prevention/prophylaxis pneumonia.Hospital infections: cross infection, nosocomial infection, hospital infection.Ventilated patients, intensive care patients: critically ill, critical illness, catastrophic illness, critical care, intensive care, intensive care unit (ICU), respiratory care units, artificial respiration, mechanical ventilation.Positioning: prone position, supine position, lateral position, sitting/semi-seated position, horizontal position, semi-recumbent position, positioning, rotation, body position, patient positioning, positioning therapy, kinetic therapy, continuous lateral rotation, backrest elevation, axial/body position change, facedown position, side position, posture.Early mobilisation: early ambulation, accelerated ambulation, occupational therapy, physical therapy, mobility therapy, exercise therapy, early mobilisation, early exercise, early activity, physical therapy modalities.Systematic research of scientific literature (University Library Regensburg), but also previously available guidelines, recommendations and expert opinions.The evaluation of these publications according to the evidence criteria of the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine (levels of evidence, www.cebm.net, as of 2001). Due to the fact that the guideline is a revision and not a new development, this schema was also applied.Consensus process The first author of the guideline was employed as a speaker and commissioned by the DGAI committee to designate additional participants of the guideline group. In two consensus conferences as well as during two telephone conferences, the core statements and recommendations were coordinated with the entire guideline group under the direction of a moderator from AWMF by means of a nominal group process. The individual steps were recorded in entirety and editorially prepared by the speaker of the guideline group together with Dr. M. Bischoff and Ms. K. Gebhardt.

All papers published in the databases as of 17 May 2005 (final date of last research) were inspected. Only German or English-language publications were taken into account. The literary search primarily related to controlled studies, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, case series, case reports and comments/editorials. The focus was on publications involving adult patients. Articles from the paediatric field were only included if statements were recognised that enabled principle and age-independent statements. Only studies conducted on humans were included. Papers relating to animal experimentation were only evaluated if significant pathophysiological conclusions could be made regarding the functional principle of positioning therapy. Articles from textbooks were not used. Informational material from the medical device industry was only used for technical questions. Initially, the literature of the already existing guideline was revised. Of the 287 publications included in the analysis at the time, only 170 articles were taken into consideration. A total of 117 articles (editorials, case reports and smaller studies) were precluded after updating the data if newer articles regarding the same subject matter had been published. Within the scope of research (May 2005\u2013May 2014), 7051 publications were initially identified based on the search terms. After viewing the abstracts, excluding duplicates and reviewing relevance, 952 publications were analysed at first. After reading the full texts, an additional 653 studies were precluded due to lacking relevance or inadequate study design (e.g. limited case numbers, probability for \u2018bias\u2019 statistical deficiencies) or lack of reference (experimental animal studies, paediatric patients). In the analysis, 299 studies were ultimately included and evaluated based on the aforementioned evidence schema. In the course of subsequently designating 29 relevant publications as well as a guideline (editorial deadline: 31 December 2014), ultimately 329 publications were analysed.

For example, a simple free-text search of PubMed by the first author on March 16, 2024, using the search query anesthesia OR analgesia OR \u201cpain medicine\u201d and covering the complete years of 1963\u20132023 yielded a total of 1570 citations in 1963 versus 26 073 in 2023. For the busy clinical practitioner and/or clinical researcher, sifting through every piece of research on a topic they are looking for an answer to is no longer realistic. Therefore, clinicians today rely on not only guidelines articles from national organizations to help steer clinical practice and research, but also reviews of the literature. While many different types of reviews, as well as subcategories of review types, currently exist, one may broadly partition these into three categories: (1) systematic reviews, (2) scoping reviews, and (3) narrative reviews. Other less common review types such as rapid reviews, umbrella reviews, that is, review of reviews, as well as realist reviews and integrative reviews, also exist.on exemplars in the field of anesthesia and pain medicine. Consistent with the narrative review approach, the recommended guidelines that follow are intended to provide some degree of flexibility when reporting, conducting, and evaluating narrative reviews.

As an example specific to pain medicine and which adhered to the PRISMA reporting guidelines, a systematic review with meta-analysis executed an a priori registered protocol to investigate whether patients with chronic pain disorders treated with spinal cord stimulation led to improvements in physical function from baseline compared with 12-month follow-up. Similarly, a systematic review without meta-analysis should adhere to PRISMA guidelines, as highlighted in a systematic review that assessed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic versus historical controls predating the pandemic on opioid-related outcomes in participants with or at risk of opioid use, misuse, or opioid use disorder. In addition to the resources available for the aforementioned reviews, instruments such as A MeaSurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR-2) are available for evaluating the quality of systematic reviews, with or without meta-analysis.

They are summarized in Table These standards can be considered best practice in CRPS as supported by expert and patient agreement. We followed a method that focused on evidence review but which prioritized the production of a series of mandatory statements of optimal clinical practice that could be followed in the majority of the 37 countries who are members of the European Pain Federation. We deliberately avoided statements of optional, desirable or aspirational practice, focusing on what was considered achievable by most. There are a number of limitations to our approach that should be taken into account. First, we did not canvas all clinicians working in this field across all of the 37 countries, or managers, politicians or other non\u2010healthcare stakeholders. We focused instead on an expert group supported by a patient representative. It is possible that different experts would have produced different standards. This was a deliberate decision on our behalf as we needed to set a first list of expert\u2010driven standards from which to build. Second, we did not produce a series of evidence syntheses (e.g., meta\u2010analytic review of efficacy or review of assessment tools). We judged that such an effort would be resource\u2010heavy and unlikely to yield any clarity due to the well\u2010documented absence of primary research into this orphan disease. Instead, we relied on the extant literature which is well known to the group. Third, our decision to craft standards as mandatory meant that the heterogeneity of different views and nuanced opinions was not reported. Presented only is the result. The standards and their production have clinical, research and policy implications. Clinical implications: the next step is to share the standards with Federation members, which has a number of challenges. First, language translation of the standards is necessary. Second, we need to survey clinicians for current practice as it relates to the standards to establish a baseline of common clinical practice.Research implications: there is no standard that could not benefit from further study. And there are two areas where we were unable to set standards of care. The group considered that a priority for research was to better understand the heterogeneity of presentation within the current broad category of CRPS. For example, there is a need to differentiate between an early and late presentation. There is a need to look at sex and age differences. And, there is a need to look at CRPS in the context of comorbidities. There are also challenges to the Budapest criteria which, summarized in Table Policy implications: these standards are the first step in a process. Standards are essentially a tool to improve practice, but practice only improves if they are used. We next need to understand the barriers to their implementation, whether they are resource, educational, legislative or organizational. We propose that a CRPS pain champion be appointed by each of the 37 national pain chapters, who can guide development and be a point of contact for this work. Finally, we recognize that these standards are open to change and should be reviewed regularly. In particular, we need to take account of national standards, practice reviews, guidance and guidelines, either from individual pain societies or those in rehabilitation, neurology or other therapy areas. We need also to be mindful of non\u2010European work that could influence these standards, including any new and emerging evidence. We have therefore agreed with the European Pain Federation to review these standards five years from their date of publication.", "type": "Document"}

This guideline provides evidence\u2010based recommendations for nonpharmacological treatments, developed by a multidisciplinary expert group, including specialists in rheumatology, rehabilitation, pain management, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), and evidence\u2010based medicine. The guideline follows the RIGHT checklist and is registered with the International Practice Guideline Registry Platform. The literature review incorporates systematic reviews, meta\u2010analyses, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) up to March 2023, focusing on the effects of nonpharmacological interventions on pain intensity, fatigue, sleep quality, mood, and quality of life. A total of 57 studies were included, with findings supporting acupuncture and health education as core therapies. These interventions significantly reduce pain, alleviate fatigue, and improve sleep quality, and are strongly recommended based on moderate\u2010quality evidence. Additionally, aerobic exercise and resistance training are recommended for their proven effectiveness in reducing pain, enhancing physical function, and providing long\u2010term benefits. Emerging therapies, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and nutritional supplements, show promise but require further research due to low\u2010certainty evidence.", "type": "Document"}

The recommendations are relevant, clinically significant, and aligned with patient needs. A review of 19 randomized trials, five systematic reviews, and 33 meta\u2010analyses made different recommendations for various nonpharmacological therapies. Among traditional therapies, acupuncture is effective in relieving pain, sleep disturbances, and fatigue. Tai chi helps improve function and reduce depression. Aerobic exercise and resistance training are strongly recommended for pain reduction, functional improvement, and long\u2010term benefits. CBT and mindfulness\u2010based therapies can help with pain, emotions, and sleep issues, although their effects vary. Emerging therapies like TMS, VRBT, and nutritional supplements show promise but need further validation. Massage, once recommended cautiously due to limited evidence and cultural differences, has been upgraded in the 2023 Chinese guideline to a \u201cstrongly recommended core therapy,\u201d supported by localized research. However, our study found limited evidence, so it is recommended conditionally. Acupuncture is strongly recommended due to its ease of use, despite moderate evidence. TMS is conditionally recommended due to its high cost and complexity. Although the evidence for aerobic exercise and resistance training is not strong, exercise therapy has achieved consensus in chronic disease management and shows a good risk\u2013benefit ratio in practice [", "type": "Document"}

At the same time, attention should be paid to personalized treatment for fibromyalgia, combining biomarkers, genetic factors, and psychosocial influences to develop precise medical strategies that improve treatment outcomes and quality of life. Given the broad impact of this disease on patients, multidisciplinary collaboration is crucial. Future guidelines should encourage cooperation among experts from various fields to create a comprehensive treatment framework. Psychosocial interventions combined with physical therapy have shown potential in alleviating symptoms and improving quality of life. Innovative therapies such as mindfulness meditation, emotional regulation training, and neurofeedback may improve mental health, reduce pain, and enhance coping abilities. Lifestyle interventions, such as nutrition, sleep, and stress management, should also be an important part of nonpharmacological treatment. Future research should evaluate the impact of specific diets on fibromyalgia and comprehensively assess the long\u2010term effects of interventions. Although some nonpharmacological therapies show potential, they have not yet been recommended due to insufficient or low\u2010quality evidence. Studies indicate that multidisciplinary treatments, including occupational therapy, may help alleviate depression and anxiety in fibromyalgia patients, but their direct effect on pain remains limited, and the evidence is inconsistent. Vibration therapy shows some potential, but small sample sizes and inadequate control designs make it difficult to determine its long\u2010term efficacy. Research on traditional therapies, such as gua sha and Ba Duan Jin, is limited by challenges related to international recognition, quantification of efficacy, and scientific validation, with insufficient clinical data hindering their widespread use. Future high\u2010quality research is needed to assess the effectiveness of these therapies and provide feasible recommendations.", "type": "Document"}

Children experience pain in a similar way to adults. pain intensity in children depends on the surgical procedure itself but also on numerous other factors such as age, emotional state or the level of anxiety associated with the hospital stay. previous pain experiences or chronic diseases that required many medical procedures may significantly change the pain threshold in paediatric patients. Moreover, genetic predispositions and environmental effects are significant [ In neonates, infants and young children, pain assessment is difficult because of the lack of verbal communication with them. Commonly recognized pain signs, such as motor agitation, uninterrupted screaming, distressed facial expressions, tachycardia or increased arterial blood pressure, may not be present or may be limited due to the patient\u2019s general condition. Some of the above symptoms may be expressions of anxiety caused by factors other than pain, e.g. discomfort, feeling cold or hungry. Unfortunately, there are still no universal tools for pain assessment that could be used in all children; therefore, the available tools should be adjusted to individual age groups. the scales most commonly used in young children rely on pain assessment conducted by the medical personnel and mainly involve the assessment of their behaviour, e.g. FlACC (Face, legs, Activity, Cry and Consolability) and/or physiological parameters, e.g. CRieS (Crying, Requirement for O2, increased heart rate, expression, Sleeplessness). in older children, it is possible to use self-report scales, e.g. the VAS (Visual Analogue Scale), the NRS (Numeric Rating Scale), or the FACeS pain Rating Scale ( Provision of adequate analgesia in children is consistent with the protocols for comprehensive perioperative care to improve treatment outcomes \u2013 enhanced Recovery After Surgery (eRAS) in paediatrics [ It includes an obligation to assess pain intensity on a regular basis, i.e. at least 3 times a day, and to keep records of assessments (similarly to other vital signs). Recently developed devices for pain monitoring and measurement give hope that pain assessment will be optimized, especially in the youngest children and those hospitalized in iCUs. Some of the devices rely on the analysis of heart rate variability, while others rely on changes in the state of parasym-pathetic system by measuring the changes in skin transduction [recommendation II C). Other methods of objective pain measurement based on determinations of plasma concentrations of such nociceptive markers as cortisol, catechola-mines, growth hormone, etc., are not applicable in children due to their invasiveness.", "type": "Document"}

Opioids are analgesics commonly used in children, mainly for relieving moderate to severe pain. Mu opioid receptor (\u03bc-receptor) agonists are most frequently used in the treatment of acute pain in children. they exert an analgesic effect and affect mood, behaviour, respiratory, cardiovascular, and digestive functions as well as functioning of the neuroendocrine and immune systems. the most common opioid-induced side effects include nausea, vomiting, excessive sedation, constipation, urine retention, itching and respiratory depression. Bearing in mind the risk of potential side effects, a possible combination of opioids with other anal-gesics for pain management in children is noteworthy. their synergistic or additive effects may reduce the total postoperative opioid dose, thus reducing the probability of side effects. An increasing number of reports point to adverse aspects of opioid effects: an immunosuppressive effect, possible opioid- induced hyperalgesia or increased tolerance to opioids. Such an \u2018opioid paradox\u2019 may occur in the case of ultra-short-acting opioids. this effect is manifested by increasing pain intensity despite opioid dose escalation. In the perioperative period, the intravenous route of opioid administration is most common. However, other routes of administration are also possible, e.g. subcutaneous, oral or transdermal, which allows unconventional therapy to be planned. When opioids are administered in a continuous infusion, strict and continuous monitoring of the patient\u2019s vital signs is necessary due to the risk of respiratory depression. Morphine is a \u03bc-receptor agonist considered the gold standard against which the effects of all other opioids are compared. its pharmacokinetics in children is similar to that in adults, except for premature babies and neonates, in whom morphine doses should be reduced due to their immature livers and kidneys [ For acute pain relief in children, morphine may be used outside the piCUs, provided that extreme caution and diligence are exercised and the patient\u2019s vital signs are continuously monitored. Sufentanil is an opioid which is 1,000 times more potent than morphine and 10 times more potent than fentanyl. its safe use should be confined to the piCU setting. it is preferably administered in a continuous infusion, although single doses may be administered as required (pro re nata \u2013 PRN). Oxycodone is an agonist of \u00b5, \u03ba, and \u03b4 receptors with strong analgesic effects. the asset of this drug is its availability in intravenous and oral forms. in poland, oxycodone has been approved for children over 12 years of age. Sequential therapy involves replacing the parenteral form of a drug with its oral form once its effective dose has been determined and the patient\u2019s clinical condition has improved. in sequential therapy, drugs well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and characterized by high bioavailability are in use. Both morphine and oxycodone may be applied in sequential therapy in children. the ratio used to convert a morphine parenteral dose into an oral dose is 1 : 3; for oxycodone this ratio is 1 : 2. In recent years, agonist/antagonist drugs have found a special place in paediatric analgesia. their characteristic feature is the \u201cceiling effect\u201d, which means that dose escalation does not increase the risk of respiratory failure. Unfortunately, increasingly high doses do not increase the effectiveness of pain treatment. Due to the \u201cceiling effect\u201d, agonist/antagonist drugs are used for managing mild to moderate postoperative pain. Nalbuphine, one of the drugs from this group used most frequently, is an agonist of the \u03ba receptor and an antagonist of the \u03bc receptor [\u20131 every 3\u20136 hours, or in an infusion at 0.05\u20130.1 mg kg\u20131 h\u20131 [ The theoretical limitation of this group of drugs is their antagonistic effect on the \u03bc receptor, which lowers the effectiveness of analgesia performed with rescue doses of full agonists and makes titration of the effective dose necessary. However, it is worth noting that reports published recently have documented the additive effect of combining morphine with nalbuphine in managing postoperative pain [ Tramadol is another weak opioid. it is an agonist of the \u03bc, \u03b4 and \u03ba receptors showing a specific affinity for the \u03bc receptor. Moreover, its analgesic effect results from nor-adrenaline reuptake inhibition and increased serotonin release. Considering the increased risk associated with the use of tramadol in the population of paediatric patients, in 2018, the United States Food and Drug Agency (FDA) forbade its use in children due to an insufficient number of scientific studies confirming its safety in paediatric patients. The ESPA (european Society for paediatric Anaesthesiologists) stated, in reference to the above decision of the FDA, that tramadol may be used in children in european countries but only in hospital settings. tramadol also induces adverse drug interactions. in the case of postoperative nausea and/or vomiting, the use of ondansetron should be avoided. Moreover, metoclopramide should not be used as an antiemetic during treatment with tramadol because of the risk of seizures. the most common dosages of opioids used in children are presented in It should be remembered that the majority of opioids induce immunosuppression, which may result in an increased risk of postoperative infection. Another significant phenomenon that may occur during the use of ultra-short-action opioids (e.g. remifentanil) is the risk of opioid-induced hyperalgesia (opioid paradox), which manifests in increasing pain intensity despite opioid dose escalation [", "type": "Document"}

A panel of expert neonatologists used systematic review, data synthesis and open discussion to reach a consensus on the level of evidence supported by the literature or customs in clinical practice and to describe a global analgesic management, considering pharmacological, non-pharmacological, behavioural and environmental measures for each invasive procedure. There is strong evidence to support some analgesic measures, e.g. sucrose or breast milk for minor invasive procedures, and combinations of drugs for tracheal intubation. Many other pain control measures used during chest tube placement and removal, screening and treatment for ROP, or for postoperative pain, are still based not on evidence, but on good practice or expert opinions.Conclusion: These guidelines should help improving the health care professional's awareness of the need to adequately manage procedural pain in neonates, based on the strongest evidence currently available.", "type": "Document"}

The role of breastfeeding or breast milk for pain control has also been documented in the last few years. NNS and sensorial saturation are other recommended techniques. In the case of tracheal intubation, several studies have demonstrated the efficacy of various drug combinations comprising an analgesic (usually an opiate) and a muscle relaxant in reducing pain and facilitating the procedure, though the superiority of any given combination remains to be established. Many other analgesics are commonly used in practice, e.g. for chest tube placement and removal, lumbar puncture, screening for ROP and laser therapy, but their usage is not evidence based.\n", "type": "Document"}

In line with other standards development groups, a panel of international experts was instituted, chaired by EE and MB. Experts from European countries were invited by email to participate, explaining the rationale for the process, and aiming for broad geographical representation within Europe. EFIC recognizes that improving the experience of patients with cancer\u2010related pain requires actions that focus on patients, clinicians and healthcare providers or systems. The EFIC Task Force on cancer\u2010related pain reviewed existing evidence\u2010based guidelines and reached a consensus on the standards for the management of cancer\u2010related pain across all 37 European countries that are members of the European Pain Federation (EFIC). This paper describes 10 standards that EFIC member countries should institute or be working towards. The standards do not specify which healthcare professional(s) should conduct assessments, agree management plans, provide tailored treatment and support, or refer for more specialized advice and treatment. The Task Force considered that all services involved in the care of patients with cancer should consider how best to meet these standards considering local expertise and resources. These standards may also prompt greater collaboration between clinicians in pain medicine, palliative care and oncology to meet the needs of patients with cancer\u2010related pain.

The aim of this systematic review was to update the available literature and develop recommendations for optimal pain management after elective caesarean section under neuraxial anaesthesia. A systematic review utilising procedure\u2010specific postoperative pain management (PROSPECT) methodology was undertaken. Randomised controlled trials published in the English language between 1 May 2014 and 22 October 2020 evaluating the effects of analgesic, anaesthetic and surgical interventions were retrieved from MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane databases. Studies evaluating pain management for emergency or unplanned operative deliveries or caesarean section performed under general anaesthesia were excluded. A total of 145 studies met the inclusion criteria. For patients undergoing elective caesarean section performed under neuraxial anaesthesia, recommendations include intrathecal morphine 50\u2013100 \u00b5g or diamorphine 300 \u00b5g administered pre\u2010operatively; paracetamol; non\u2010steroidal anti\u2010inflammatory drugs; and intravenous dexamethasone administered after delivery. If intrathecal opioid was not administered, single\u2010injection local anaesthetic wound infiltration; continuous wound local anaesthetic infusion; and/or fascial plane blocks such as transversus abdominis plane or quadratus lumborum blocks are recommended. The postoperative regimen should include regular paracetamol and non\u2010steroidal anti\u2010inflammatory drugs with opioids used for rescue. The surgical technique should include a Joel\u2010Cohen incision; non\u2010closure of the peritoneum; and abdominal binders. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation could be used as analgesic adjunct. Some of the interventions, although effective, carry risks, and consequentially were omitted from the recommendations.

The updated literature strengthens the previous PROSPECT recommendations for pain management in patients undergoing elective caesarean section and modifies it in certain aspects. The updated PROSPECT methodology further strengthens the recommendations, because it goes beyond assessment of the available evidence based solely on statistical analysis [ Of note, it is essential to highlight that this guideline focuses on elective caesarean section under neuraxial anaesthesia. Importantly, these recommendations should not be applied to other patient populations such as emergency or unplanned caesarean section or surgery performed under general anaesthesia. The recommended strategies have sufficient procedure\u2010specific evidence and have a positive balance of clinical benefits and risk of side\u2010effects (Table Intrathecal morphine at doses of 100 \u00b5g or lower is recommended. Doses lower than 100 \u00b5g result in adequate analgesia with a reduced incidence of side\u2010effects. Recently, Sharawi et al. confirmed the safety of intrathecal morphine when used in patients undergoing caesarean section [ Various local anaesthetic techniques such as TAP blocks, quadratus lumborum blocks and local anaesthetic wound infiltration are effective in reducing pain scores and opioid requirements. Given that the potential side\u2010effects of these regional analgesic techniques are limited, they are recommended. However, the additional value of any of these techniques when combined with intrathecal morphine appears to be minimal. Therefore, these blocks may be administered if intrathecal morphine is not used. Surgical techniques that have been shown to be beneficial and are therefore recommended include Joel\u2010Cohen incision and avoidance of peritoneum closure. Using abdominal binders postoperatively is recommended with sufficient procedure\u2010specific evidence being identified. Analgesic adjuncts such as listening to music via headphones and use of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation may be associated with improved pain relief and are recommended when available. Although pre\u2010operative gabapentinoids were recommended previously, they are no longer recommended despite positive studies of their benefits due to concerns about side\u2010effects such as sedation and respiratory depression [ Several intra\u2010operative interventions are not recommended due to inconsistent or limited or lack of procedure\u2010specific evidence and/or concerns of side\u2010effects (Table Intrathecal or epidural administration of buprenorphine, hydromorphone, midazolam, \u02512\u2010adrenergic agonists, neostigmine and ketamine has been reported to prolong the analgesic duration of morphine. However, they cannot be recommended due to inconsistent procedure\u2010specific evidence and due to the potential side\u2010effects such as hypotension or sedation. Additionally, in most studies, hypotension occurs as frequently as sedation. Peritoneal instillation of local anaesthetics cannot be recommended due to a lack of procedure\u2010specific evidence. Similarly, topical local anaesthetic cream application is not recommended due to a lack of procedure\u2010specific evidence. The limitations of this review are related to those of the included studies. There was considerable heterogeneity between studies with regard to dosing regimens and route of administration as well as the timing of pain assessments. The small size of most studies makes it impossible to draw conclusions about the safety profile of an individual intervention. In the majority of included studies, the analgesic intervention was not evaluated against an optimised multimodal analgesic regimen. Moreover, measuring just pain scores and/or opioid consumption is not sufficient and more comprehensive, patient\u2010centred tools to assess pain relief and functionality would better reflect day\u2010to\u2010day clinical practice but are unfortunately poorly reported in the literature. Also, because most studies include healthy, full\u2010term parturients, our recommendations may not be applicable to parturients with co\u2010existing medical conditions such as morbid obesity, chronic pain as well as preterm delivery. Furthermore, the PROSPECT methodology uses a minimal clinically important difference in pain scores of 1/10. However, this difference has never been validated in obstetric patients. Future adequately powered studies should assess the effects of analgesic interventions not only on pain, opioid consumption, opioid\u2010related adverse events and complications associated with the intervention, but also outcome measures such as time to ambulation, hospital stay and the occurrence of chronic pain or chronic opioid consumption. Furthermore, it is necessary to examine the influence of analgesic interventions on patient\u2010reported outcomes such as mother\u2010child bonding, breast feeding ability, time to ambulation and return to activities of daily living. Validated scoring tools such as the quality of recovery\u201011 are useful metrics that should be considered. In summary, this review has identified an analgesic regimen that can be used for optimal pain management after elective caesarean section performed under neuraxial anaesthesia. A combination of basic analgesics such as paracetamol; NSAIDs or cyclo\u2010oxygenase\u20102\u2013selective inhibitors; and i.v. dexamethasone, along with a local/regional analgesic techniques (e.g. intrathecal morphine 50\u2013100 \u00b5g or diamorphine 300 \u00b5g); local anaesthetic infiltration with or without a field blocks such as ilio\u2010inguinal and iliohypogastric nerves blocks or fascial plane blocks (e.g. TAP, quadratus lumborum or ESP blocks) are recommended. However, the benefits of local and regional analgesic techniques are not apparent with the use of intrathecal morphine or diamorphine. Analgesic adjuncts such as listening to music via headphones and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation may be used when available. Several aspects of the surgical technique clearly yield positive analgesic effects after caesarean section including the Joel\u2010Cohen incision, non\u2010closure of the peritoneum and the use of abdominal binders. The PROSPECT recommendation for postoperative analgesia after caesarean section has established a multimodal pre\u2010, intra\u2010 and postoperative analgesic strategy which combined with certain surgical approaches and adjuvant techniques may provide excellent analgesia.\n", "type": "Document"}

The importance of maintaining quality of life (QOL) and activities of daily living (ADLs) is being emphasized. Pain not only significantly impairs patients' QOL and ADLs, but can also lead to social problems such as loss of productivity and increased medical costs. The Japan Society of Pain Clinicians has developed various guidelines to appropriately respond to pain. One example of such guidelines is the Guidelines for Prescribing Opioid Analgesics for Chronic Non-Cancer Pain. Opioid analgesics are powerful pain relievers, but inappropriate use can cause a variety of problems. Especially, in chronic non-cancer pain, inappropriate use of opioid analgesics might fail to improve or even worsen the QOL and ADLs of patients with pain. In Japan, chronic non-cancer pain was added as an indication for some opioid analgesics in 2011. Opioid analgesic prescriptions for chronic non-cancer pain had officially begun, and they are becoming more widespread in pain medicine. Opioid analgesics are expected to continue as an option for improving the QOL and ADLs of patients with chronic non-cancer pain. With these considerations in mind, the first edition of these guidelines was developed and published in 2012. The situation has changed over the years since 2012, when the First Edition was prepared, to 2017, when the revised Second Edition was prepared, and to the present. The following points were considered by the working group when they began working on the revision of these guidelines.In Europe and the United States, where prescribing opioid analgesics for chronic non-cancer pain was the norm, it has become clear that long-term or high-dose prescribing is associated with a lack of evidence regarding efficacy. In fact, it poses various problems and guidelines have been revised in other countries.Inappropriate use of opioid analgesics in Japan has become a problem, especially among cancer survivors who have relatively easy access to opioid analgesics.With the increase in the number of opioid analgesics and related drugs available in Japan and the launch of generic versions of some opioid analgesics, the indications and instructions about dosage and administration in package inserts must be more closely followed.In some countries, the social flooding of opioid analgesics due to easily accessible prescriptions has led to serious social problems, known as the opioid crisis. For this reason, it is necessary to continue to regulate and control opioid analgesics in Japan. In light of the current situation in Japan, the Japan Society of Pain Clinicians has determined an urgent need to revise the guidelines. It has appointed new committee members to form the Working Group (WG) for Guidelines for Prescribing Opioid Analgesics for Chronic non-cancer Pain, which has begun work on the revised Third Edition. As with the revised Second Edition, the most important messages of the First Edition is maintained: \u201cProtect the social order with respect to opioid analgesics,\u201d \u201cProtect patients from inappropriate use of opioid analgesics,\u201d and \u201cImprove patients' quality of life with opioid analgesics.\u201d These three basic principles that were the most important in the first edition (Fig. In revising these guidelines, we have tried to ensure consistency with other treatment guidelines and statements produced by the society. To make these guidelines more publicly accessible, we have created them in the form of clinical questions (CQs) in accordance with the basic policy of evidence-based medicine (EBM) and the Guidelines Promotion Project (Minds) by the Japan Council for Quality Health Care.", "type": "Document"}

Opioid analgesics: specifics (Table 2) > Clinical question 2-6: What kind of opioid analgesic is oxycodone hydrochloride [13, 76\u201387]? > Summary statement\nOxycodone is a strong opioid analgesic that is water-soluble. Its analgesic effect is the same as that of morphine, but because its bioavailability is high, it is possible to obtain the same analgesic effect with two-thirds of the dose when administered orally. The main metabolic enzymes are CYP3A4/5 and CYP2D6. Active metabolites such as noroxymorphone have a long duration of action. The unchanged drug is also excreted in the urine in relatively large amounts. Caution, albeit less than for morphine, is required when using it in patients with impaired renal function. Oxycodone extended-release formulation (anti-tampering agent) is covered by insurance for chronic non-cancer pain.

Next, the \u03bc-opioid receptor antagonist naloxone hydrochloride should be administered. The typical intravenous dose is 0.2 mg. If the effect is insufficient, additional 0.2 mg should be administered every few minutes. In case of a serious condition, advanced cardiac life support should be given first.", "type": "Document"}

These guidelines are intended to promote the understanding and dissemination of appropriate treatment methods involving opioid analgesics for chronic non-cancer pain, including in cancer survivors. 2. The aim of treatment with opioid analgesics in chronic non-cancer pain is to alleviate the patient's pain and improve their QOL that has been reduced due to pain without worsening their QOL due to adverse events. 3. The treatment of chronic non-cancer pain with opioid analgesics in Japan is based on a completely different philosophy than the philosophy for treating direct cancer pain. 4. Adhere to the \u201cIndications\u201d and \u201cDosage and Administration\u201d of each opioid analgesic and its generic equivalents approved in Japan. 5. Comply with the contents of the package inserts for opioid analgesics. 6. Treatment with opioid analgesics for chronic non-cancer pain is not indicated for all patients; it should be limited to situations that meet the following criteria. (1) Clear organic cause of persistent pain. (2) No effective pain relief measures other than treatment with opioid analgesics (3) Understanding of the purpose of treatment with opioid analgesics. (4) Good adherence to medication (able to comply with medication instructions). (5) No history of substance or alcohol dependence. (6) The organic factors of pain outweigh the psychosocial factors. (7) Obtain informed consent after full explanation of the purpose of treatment, efficacy, and problems of treatment, and treatment duration with a view to reducing the dose or stopping the drug to the patient and family members prior to starting treatment with opioid analgesics for chronic non-cancer pain, with confirmation and consent forms necessary for prescribing medical narcotics. 7. When prescribing opioid analgesics, consider taking some kind of action against side effects. 8. It is recommended that the dose be \u2264 60 morphine milligram equivalents/day. It is strongly recommended that the upper limit be 90 morphine milligram equivalents/day (Refer to Table 9. The standard duration of treatment is considered to be 3 months. The dosage should be reduced with consideration of discontinuation after a maximum of 6 months. This does not apply to tramadol, but always consider its necessity and avoid unnecessary long-term continuation. 10. For pain in cancer survivors that is not directly caused by cancer, such as pain after treatment or pain associated with complications or pre-existing conditions, these guidelines should be followed.\n", "type": "Document"}

If an epidural hematoma or abscess is ruled out, but medullary ischemia is suspected/confirmed, there are arguments for maintaining the blood pressure at high\u2010normal, maintaining normoglycemia, and considering drainage of CSF.

However, EB has multi-system effects and patients present with a number of both acute and chronic pain care needs [ The present guidelines on pain care for patients with EB are based on a review and synthesis of the available literature, guided by expert consensus and thoughtful application of theory. The guidelines are divided into four topics: psychological treatment of pain and pruritus, acute pain, chronic and recurrent pain, and special topics. The Psychological and Integrative Treatments section leads off because the information it contains applies to all the topics that follow. The Acute Pain section focuses on postoperative pain. The Chronic and Recurrent Pain section includes dressing changes, baths, skin pain and joint and other body pains. The Special Topics section includes pain care in infants with EB and pain care at the end of life. While not pain per se, itching is a major source of discomfort [ The aim of the guidelines is to provide the user with information on pain care for children and adults with EB. These guidelines can be applied to all patients diagnosed with hereditary forms of EB. Patients with acquired forms are not included in the guidelines. The guidelines contain two types of guidance. Recommendations are graded and highlighted in text boxes at the end of the manuscript. Good Practice Points are located at the end of each topical section and summarize concepts and best practices, based on the clinical experience of the guidelines development group. The daily routine of many patients with severe forms of EB will have a number of painful events, each of which may suggest the need for intervention. However, addressing each one pharmacologically may lead to a level of sedation that prevents a meaningful level of productivity. It is important to discuss the needs of the patient and the options for caring for those needs with the patient and family. Together, the patient, family and practitioner can transform the guidelines into an individualized care plan. It is to be expected that each patient\u2019s needs will be dynamic; periodic review of the needs and goals will optimize care at each step of the patient's life. Of note, the term `EB\u2019 will be used throughout the text. However, four major types of EB are known and are categorized as Simplex (EBS), Junctional (JEB), dystrophic types (DEB) and Kindler Syndrome. A recent consensus statement was released that reclassified the subtypes further based on anatomic location within the skin and pattern of involvement, and discouraged the use of eponyms (with the exception of Kindler Syndrome). EBS is sub-typed as EBS suprabasal and EBS basal, JEB as JEB generalized and JEB localized, DEB as Recessive DEB and Dominant DEB (RDEB and DDEB, respectively) [", "type": "Document"}

The group comprised representatives from nursing, medicine and psychology who were expert in the clinical care of patients with EB. Guidelines topics and subtopics were chosen by the multidisciplinary group with input from outside clinicians, based on issues presented in the literature, seen clinically and raised for discussion at DEBRA International Congress meetings. Individuals or small groups were assigned to the various subtopics. After relevant literature was reviewed, preliminary recommendations for each subsection were made. Recommendations were circulated by email among the entire panel of experts for review and input/feedback was incorporated. Initial citations were added or removed as required for accuracy and appropriateness, and criticism made of areas of weakness. Thus, the group formed the first iteration of expert consensus. The revised recommendations were recirculated to the group for review, to establish consensus more firmly. A panel of outside reviewers, comprising both clinicians and patients/families, then reviewed the document for comprehensibility, omissions and applicability. Following external review (see Acknowledgements for reviewers), funding became available and a subsequent systematic evidence review was conducted by a trained methodologist (author DSL). Clinical questions and the systematic search strategy were developed, based on the guideline topics and subtopics from the working group. The population of interest comprises patients with pain who have any variant of EB. The interventions included, but were not limited to, pharmacological, holistic, psychological, psychical therapy and/or environmental interventions. Outcomes of interest were improvement in symptom control (for example, pain, itch) and level of function. Systematic literature searches were conducted using MedLine, CINAHL, PsycInfo and The Cochrane Library. Search terms for `epidermolysis bullosa\u2019 and `pain\u2019, `regional anesthesia\u2019, or `nerve block\u2019 were used as medical subject headings and/or keywords in all databases. The search was only limited to articles published in English. No other restrictions, limits or filters were used. Publication dates were not restricted for any topic or subtopic, as the diagnosis is rare and there were few studies of higher level, directly-related evidence (that is, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials). Reference lists were searched to identify studies. Studies submitted by the working group and used in the initial consensus processes were also reviewed. The most recent systematic search for pediatric acute, chronic, or recurrent pain management in EB patients was conducted in December 2011. Citations from the evidence searches were reviewed by title and abstract for potential inclusion, regardless of study design (n = 1,061). Evidence related to the clinical questions from systematic reviews, meta-analyses and RCTs as well as observational studies, case reports and expert opinion articles were reviewed (see Figure All included articles were critically appraised using evidence appraisal forms from the LEGEND (Let Evidence Guide Every New Decision) evidence evaluation system [ Given the paucity of data for statistical analysis, it was deemed appropriate to conduct a face-to-face consensus meeting on 4, 5 May 2012 in Cincinnati, OH.

The Japanese Society of Pain Clinicians (JSPC) has developed clinical guidelines of pharmacotherapy for neuropathic pain. These guidelines offer clarity on recommendations based on both the most recent scientific evidence and expert opinions. Understanding the concept, disease entity, and burden of neuropathic pain, as well as its screening and diagnosis are important steps before starting pharmacotherapy. As well as other guidelines, the guidelines propose several lines of pharmacotherapies in a step-wise manner. To name a few different points, our guidelines propose an extract from inflamed cutaneous tissue of rabbits inoculated with vaccinia virus, which has been found to be effective for post-herpetic neuralgia in Japan, as one of the second-line drugs. When prescribing opioid analgesics, proposed as the third-line drugs, for neuropathic pain, the guidelines recommend physicians continue evaluations on either abuse or addiction. The guidelines do not recommend concomitant use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and acetaminophen because of lack of clinical evidence of their efficacy. If patients do not respond well to pharmacotherapy, which is prescribed in a step-wise manner, other treatment strategies should be considered to improve patients\u2019 activities of daily living and QOL.", "type": "Document"}

It arises from a heterogeneous group disorders that affect the peripheral and central somatosensory nervous systems. It is now regarded as a distinct clinical entity despite a large variety of causes. People with neuropathic pain may experience altered pain sensation, areas of numbness or burning, and continuous or intermittent evoked or spontaneous pain. Thus, neuropathic pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience. Professional organizations, including the Japanese Society of Pain Clinicians (JSPC), and nations have developed guidelines of pharmacotherapy for neuropathic pain. Existing guidelines share some common elements, including dosing thresholds, necessity of titration, and risk mitigation strategies. However, there is considerable variability in the specific recommendations (e.g., range of dosing thresholds), audience (e.g., primary care clinicians versus specialists), use of evidence (e.g., systematic review, grading of evidence and recommendations, and role of expert opinion) and rigor of methods for addressing conflicts of interest. Most guidelines do not reflect the insurance system and approved medications in respective countries. In 2011, the JSPC published the Clinical Guidelines of Pharmacotherapy for Neuropathic Pain, first edition [ The guidelines are structured by three large categories (i.e., overview of neuropathic pain; diagnosis and treatment of neuropathic pain; and disease with present neuropathic pain) and 37 sub-entries.

This can be achieved by the prevention and relief of suffering, ensuring comfort and dignity, by means of early identification, assessment and management of pain and other, physical, psychosocial and spiritual issues. Patients with head and neck cancer are a group in whom both specialist palliative and supportive care is especially appropriate whether the treatment intent is curative or not, since the disease and its treatments result in a huge burden of morbidity: short and long term \u2013 even lifelong for survivors. In addition to the physical symptoms, these patients often have very significant comorbidities, including tobacco and alcohol dependence, and complex psychosocial issues. All professionals caring for head and neck cancer patients should assess palliative and supportive care needs in initial treatment planning, and throughout the illness, and be aware when specialist palliative care expertise is needed. This may involve core multidisciplinary team (MDT) members, social workers, psychologists etc. Levels of intervention may involve in-patient, out-patient, day care, home care and telephone advice, from a single, arm's length intervention to a taking over of care. Support provided will need to accommodate any communication impediment. In turn, specialist palliative care practitioners need to be aware of when and how to use palliative interventions such as surgery, radiotherapy (RT) and chemotherapy. All this is best achieved by a high level of integration of services \u2013 team working, including the primary care team \u2013 and excellent communication, with the \u2018key worker\u2019 (usually a specialist nurse) at the centre.

Drugs, anticancer treatments such as RT, surgery and procedures will dominate in the first category, whilst counselling, honest communication, support groups and complementary therapies will be preferred in the second. This distinction is not clear-cut, however; counselling and honest communication are important parts of pain relief, whilst drugs have a role in the management of symptoms such as anxiety and depression. A well-developed multidisciplinary approach, coupled with an open-minded approach to intervention, is therefore essential. It is the role of the MDT team to discuss treatment options in all patients. This includes decisions on who should be treated and what is untreatable disease. This is a complex issue and although broad guidelines can be applied each case should be assessed individually. Radical treatment in advanced or recurrent head and neck cancer may be futile and result in poorer QoL, therefore important decisions need to be made at presentation about which treatment pathway to take. The alternative where there is a low chance of cure is a palliative pathway. Palliative treatments include surgical and non-surgical interventions with the intention of slowing disease growth and symptom control, and extending life with focus purely on symptom control. Effective decision making in the palliative setting is important. The patient and family should adequately understand the diagnosis and prognosis, especially if the trajectory changes due to intervention or disease progression. It should be made clear that symptoms will be identified and treated and patients should be asked if there are any new goals for their treatment since cure is not possible. In other words, the team should not convey a sense of hopelessness simply because the goal is not indefinite survival. Hope can be maintained within the context of the patient's own goals whether they are: \u2022physical \u2013 relief of symptoms\u2022psychological \u2013 fear of distress, suffocation, bleeding or uncontrollable pain at the end of life\u2022Social \u2013 desire to witness a family event, celebrate a birthday or make a trip. Symptoms should be actively sought and treated in a proactive manner, and it should not be assumed or conveyed that any new symptom is as uncontrollable as the tumour itself. Treatment options should be discussed for the new symptom including those that may not extend life. Although patient choice is central to the treatment options taken, the treating clinician should make recommendations to guide treatment and share the burden of difficult decisions.

Patients may remain active and self-caring while trying to cope with problems of pain, swallowing, breathing and bleeding. Palliative surgery may be indicated in such cases. Little high-level evidence is available to confirm the surgical benefit; however, descriptive studies support its use in selected cases. Surgery can reduce primary tumour bulk, reduce pain and bleeding, improve swallowing, nutrition and improve and airway (see below). Debulking surgery for advanced neck disease can achieve symptom control, but major resections only rarely offer levels of benefit, which justify the extent of surgical morbidity. Newer endovascular techniques, including embolisation and vessel stenting, may offer symptom control for bleeding related to major vascular erosion, and these interventions can be considered in patients at high risk of erosion of major vessels. Acute haemorrhage from carotid \u2018blow-out\u2019 (erosion of the carotid vessels) is a distressing end of life event. Whilst occasional success can be achieved with swift surgical intervention, many patients succumb rapidly. In these cases, attempts to reduce the flow of blood with direct pressure while administering appropriate rapid acting sedatives (e.g. benzodiazepines) should be made. Constant verbal support to the patient is a key to help handle anxiety. Do not leave the patient's side. If surgical intervention is considered inappropriate careful discussion and measured information giving to the patient (if they wish to participate) or family members and carers is essential. This should include the anticipated clinical scenario and an acceptable plan of care should be devised to manage these circumstances. This may include the use of dark towels, anticipatory prescribing, and may influence preferred place of care.

This is due to: \u2022mechanical obstruction\u2022functional obstruction\u2022drug induced side effects\u2022fistula\u2022pain. Assessment of the swallow is essential in palliative head and neck patients. It is important to establish whether oral intake is possible and whether it is safe. Aspiration is not uncommon and may be silent in up to 40 per cent of patients, thus the bedside assessment is of limited value. Functional endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES) is straightforward, easily repeatable, portable and can give good information on the aetiology of aspiration as well as feedback to the patient on trials of preventative manoeuvres. It can also be useful in the assessment of ability to deal with different textures and complements information obtained from videofluoroscopy. Aspiration does not inevitably mean no oral intake. A degree of aspiration may be well tolerated and methods taught to clear the airway after swallowing can be implemented. Similarly certain textures may be better tolerated and the use of thickened fluids can help maintain oral intake. It is important to take into account the patient's wishes and the patient may make an informed choice to continue to swallow despite the potential and real risk of aspiration pneumonia. Quality of life is absolute. In patients who are unable to swallow, the use of an enteral route via nasogastric tube (NGT) or gastrostomy allows for hydration, nutrition and medication. The type of tube used depends largely on ability to pass an NGT or fashion a gastrostomy, perceived duration of use and patient choice. If enteral nutrition via NGT is likely to extend beyond two to three weeks then gastrostomy should be considered and discussed with the patient. There exists no clear guidance on when or if it is acceptable to withdraw nutritional support. Patient and family wishes are crucial in this decision process and full consultation is imperative. Conventional treatments can be helpful in the palliation of swallowing. Surgical debulking either with or without the laser or debrider and RT may help reduce bulk in a hypopharyngeal tumour, dilatation can help in stricture formation and this can be surgical or radiologically guided. Stenting may play a role but often head and neck tumours are too high to accommodate a stent comfortably and without impacting on other functions.

However, it may be possible to avoid tracheostomy in some cases if the consideration is given to surgical debulking techniques. This is dependent on local expertise and equipment. Sometimes avoiding surgical intervention is the most appropriate course of action, for example, a patient with a tracheal tumour that has been repeatedly debulked, and has received palliative RT, is not a candidate for stenting. There will come a time when the airway compromise will be life threatening. A tracheostomy may not be an option in this instance. In such instances opioids for dyspnoea in addition to palliative sedation and reduction of secretions can support a patient in a terminal event. These situations are difficult and information should be imparted to the patient sensitively. In the situation where the patient wants to fully discuss the anticipated scenario a sense of control can be restored to them by discussing what interventions can be undertaken pharmacologically to avoid any distress. If the patient does not want to participate in the discussion this should be documented and discussed with family and/or carers. This situation may influence the preferred place of care. To have the patient and the family prepared for the event is paramount.

It is initiated by titrating immediate release morphine oral solution or tablet (e.g. Oramorph\u2122 solution or Sevredol\u2122 tablet). Once responsiveness and dosage are known, then sustained release preparations are used, with immediate release doses for breakthrough at a sixth of the 24 hour sustained release dosage. If the patient can swallow, then sustained release tablets (e.g. MST Continus\u2122) or capsules (e.g. Zomorph\u2122) can be used. If a tube is in place then a morphine suspension (e.g. MST suspension\u2122) or opened capsules (e.g. Zomorph\u2122) can be used. If this is not feasible, usually because of vomiting, then a subcutaneous (SC) infusion of morphine or diamorphine can be used, with SC doses for breakthrough. Diamorphine is preferred since it is more soluble and can be used in much smaller volumes. Transdermal preparations of fentanyl have theoretical and practical attractions for stable background pain as an alternative, particularly if there is morphine intolerance (e.g. sedation and dysphoria) or there is renal failure. For breakthrough pain, oral opioids can still be used. Alternatively, new preparations of buccal, sublingual or intranasal fentanyl may have a role in specific situations, with supervision of a specialist service. Oxycodone can be an alternative to morphine where there is intolerance, particularly dysphoria; there is an immediate release solution and injection, but there is only a tablet form of sustained release oral preparation, limiting its use where swallowing is compromised.

Dying patients may have significant and rapidly changing symptoms, together with a recognition that no further active intervention is appropriate. For these reasons, timely assessment, regular review and confident symptom control are essential. In addition, this is an important time for loved ones; as noted by Dame Cicely Saunders, \u2018How people die remains in the memories of those who live on\u2019. Ongoing sensitive and honest communication, coupled with sensible and proactive decision-making are therefore essential. Reversible causes for a patient's deterioration should be considered and may be acted upon depending upon earlier discussions, clinical acumen and based on the best interests of the patient. The physical changes preceding death generally include decreasing mobility, decreasing level of consciousness and interaction, minimal intake, progressing to no oral intake, decreasing urine output, haemodynamic deterioration and changes in respiratory pattern. Recognising death is imminent, the doctor may lead multiprofessional decision making and communication ensuring the patient (if appropriate) and families or carers understand the expected trajectory. The patient's values and preferences should be upheld where possible, these may include rapid discharge to enable the patient to die in the place of their choice, or enable their family to stay with them if in in-patient settings. Any religious, spiritual or cultural preferences should be identified. The Liverpool Care Pathway (LCP) was a protocol developed at the Marie Curie Institute Liverpool, and in use in the UK between 1997 and 2014. Concerns about the use of the pathway were raised in the press, and a subsequent government review was undertaken. Whilst recognising both good and bad outcomes arising from the use of the pathway, the ultimate recommendation of the review body was that the LCP be withdrawn. Current approach is based on this framework but using a more individualised and tailored care plan. Such plans are currently subject to local variation but can be used in all care settings including patient homes. National guidance is being developed following consultation. A key role of the doctor is to recognise that death is imminent, and, as recommended in the government review, the patient's senior clinician has a vital role in this decision in the MDT. Recognition of dying should prompt a thorough review of all care and interventions, with unnecessary medication being stopped, and essential medication continued, usually by SC infusions and boluses. In the head and neck patient, the frequent presence of NG and gastrostomy tubes allows continued use of some medications which would otherwise be impossible to administer. It is important to highlight that recognising dying does not automatically lead to discontinuing any such interventions; only that their role in improving symptoms should be assessed. Whilst nutrition is usually inappropriate in dying patients neither SC nor intravenous fluid is necessarily ruled out \u2013 although the benefits can be, indeed often are very limited. Enteral tubes provide a further option for those patients. Sensitive discussion with the patient (if appropriate) and family or carers should be initiated to dispel any concerns held and agree a plan appropriate to the individual which may require modification depending upon the timescale and symptoms observed. A further vital aspect of end of life care, recognised both in the LCP and the review, is the need for regular multiprofessional assessment, and the possibility that patients may improve, for whatever reason, and hence the management plan be changed. Whilst an individualised approach is vital for dying patients, certain symptoms are common enough to warrant \u2018anticipatory prescribing\u2019. The four major symptoms for which this is appropriate are: \u2022pain\u2022nausea and vomiting\u2022agitation\u2022excess secretions. The choice of drugs used is left to individual units and must be individualised further for some patients. For most purposes: \u2022analgesia \u2013 diamorphine or morphine\u2022anti-emetic \u2013 haloperidol or levomepromazine\u2022agitation \u2013 midazolam and/or levomepromazine or haloperidol\u2022antisecretory \u2013 hyoscine, either butyl or hydrobromide. Common reasons for modifying the drugs of choice include poor tolerance of previous drugs, cases where other drugs have an already-established role, clinical contra-indications or renal failure. Fortunately, all the commonly needed drugs can be given subcutaneously, and feeding tubes increase the available options. Areas which require ongoing monitoring and vigilance include mouth care, tracheostomy and wound care, pressure areas, and continence. Recommendation \u2022All patients at the end of life should have anticipatory medication available to palliate common symptoms and should have an individualised care plan (G)", "type": "Document"}

Ultimately, any decisions made around CPR should be undertaken in advance. In the event of a cardiac arrest, and where no such decisions have been made in advance, the default position is to perform CPR. In some cases, even in patients with incurable disease, this is appropriate. In the dying patient, however, or in cases where the chances of CPR succeeding are remote, then CPR adds no benefit to patient care. In such cases, a \u2018Do not attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation\u2019 (DNACPR) order should be completed. There exists a number of issues regarding DNACPR decisions, outlined in national guidance issued by the British Medical Association (BMA), Royal College of Nursing (RCN) and Resuscitation Council (RC), and recently examined in a Court of Appeal Judgement. Two key points stand out \u2013 the decision-making around CPR, and the discussion around such decisions. The current BMA, RCN and RC guidance is summarised here, but may be subject to review in the coming months.", "type": "Document"}

Examples of such cases include acute reversible illnesses or treatable arrhythmias. Similarly, if a cardiac arrest is unlikely, then CPR should be attempted if it occurs. Examples here include the otherwise healthy person admitted with a relatively minor illness or an out-of-hospital arrest in public. A presumption of patient consent exists here, and it is not relevant to discuss in advance unless requested (and in such a case, patient wish should be respected). Whilst this is applicable to many hospital patients, it is less relevant to palliative care patients, in whom life-threatening events are more likely, and CPR is less likely to succeed. At the other extreme, where a patient is dying and no reversible causes for their condition exist, then CPR is inappropriate. In this context, cardiac arrest may be viewed as the final event in the process of natural death. Nevertheless, whilst the clinical decision may be clear, serious consideration needs to be given to discussion with the patient and family; this is covered in the section \u2018Discussing CPR decisions\u2019, below. In many cases, including in palliative care, the benefits and burdens of CPR are less clear-cut. For example, in a patient with an ultimately palliative diagnosis but who is otherwise active and well, there is a small chance that CPR in the event of a cardiac arrest may succeed. It is beyond the remit of this work to outline factors that count for and against this. In such cases, the preferences of patients (or those delegated to make decisions on their behalf) are pivotal.", "type": "Document"}

Any discussion revolves around sensitively informing the patient (and/or any person delegated to be involved in such discussions) of the decision that has been made. Difficulties here arise where the patient or delegated person objects to the decision. In such cases, seeking a second opinion is good practice. It is usually possible to work through such disagreements with time and sensitive communication. In some such cases, the cited guidance allows for DNACPR decisions not to be discussed with the patient or their delegated decision-maker. This applies to situations where the treating team have strong reason to believe that such discussions will cause significant distress or where the patient has asked not to be involved in such discussions. Citing risk of distress should not be undertaken lightly; any such judgement should be carefully documented and backed up with evidence \u2013 such decisions have been challenged in court. It is important to reinforce that the clarity of the decision is not a factor in considering whether to discuss a DNACPR order.

Whilst a competent patient may decline CPR, they may not insist on receiving CPR in the event that they suffer a cardiac arrest, if it is deemed that CPR would not succeed. Where there is a possibility of success, eliciting and respecting the patient's wish is crucial. Such discussions should be handled sensitively, and the patient given the opportunity to consider the discussion and invite family members/carers to support them. There are further subtleties to these decisions, but such discussion is outside the remit of this work. Examples include a patient refusing discussion, or a patient delegating a decision to healthcare professionals.

Two further issues warrant discussion, however; managing unresolved disagreements and transfer to the home environment. Despite the emotive nature of the subject and complexity of decisions, it is usually possible to work through DNACPR decisions to the agreement of the patient, their loved ones and the clinical team. As described above, a second opinion can be helpful in resolving a disagreement. Occasionally no agreement can be reached between doctor, the team, the patient and those close to the patient. In extreme cases, particularly where the patient lacks capacity, legal advice may be required and consideration given to more formal measures such as the involvement of the Court of Protection. A further point to highlight is the transfer of DNACPR decisions to the home environment. In such context, the patient and their family/carers are responsible for the documentation and, as such, are able to ignore or withhold it if they wish. For this reason, clear communication and agreement in advance are vital.
