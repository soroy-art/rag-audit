The writing group made two key decisions in writing this article. The first was that given the overwhelming evidence of inequities across professions in the workplace, there was no need to develop a separate rationale for each of the strategic objectives outlined below. Second, the group determined that these strategic objectives are aspirational and should serve as a roadmap for organizations, women, and men as we work together to achieve true equity for women in geriatrics. We refined our vision and strategic objectives in multiple ways. We reviewed initiatives focused on ensuring that women are treated equally in the workforce, including Lean In, the American College of Physicians, and the Society for Human Resource Management. Additionally, we incorporated feedback from our members who participated in a plenary session at the 2019 AGS Annual Scientific Meeting. Using an anonymous polling platform, we polled attendees on whether they agree, disagree, or are unsure about each of the 14 statements. There was overwhelming support for these statements, with an average of 469 attendees responding to each statement. Following the meeting, the language of some statements was modified based on the polling data as well as open-ended feedback from attendees regarding practical steps for implementation of this work.Following the 2019 AGS Annual Scientific Meeting, the writing group worked to refine the strategic objectives and accompanying practical recommendations presented here for how geriatrics, as a field, can work together to attain a future in which the rights of women are guaranteed and women in geriatrics have the opportunity to achieve their full potential. Although we have included separate sections specific to academics, trainees, and the direct care workforce, all recommendations include women pursuing these careers or who are still in training. For the direct care workforce, AGS believes that there are several policy changes (eg, paid family medical leave and workplace safety measures) that would positively impact the lives of the many individuals who are providing direct care to older Americans. The final statement was reviewed and approved by AGS leadership in June 2019.", "type": "Document"}

Patients in these studies stressed the importance of knowing who to contact if they have concerns or queries, particularly after discharge. The studies also illustrated how people's information needs change before, during and after surgery, with some postoperative patients reporting difficulty recalling information given to them before surgery. The committee agreed that their experience reflects the evidence. They also noted that people who feel well informed about their surgery and recovery are less anxious than those who do not.The committee concurred that their recommendation, together with the recommendations in the NICE guidelines on patient experience in adult NHS services and care and support of people growing older with learning disabilities cover the information and support needed by adults during perioperative care.", "type": "Document"}

The report noted that the use of ERPs varies across specialties and hospitals. To implement this recommendation, specialties and hospitals that do not currently provide an ERP covering all 3 stages of perioperative care for patients having major or complex elective surgery will need to restructure their surgical care. This might have an initial resource impact, although some features of an ERP, such as early mobilisation and early intake of food and fluids, are current practice in many hospitals. Introducing an ERP can be expected to reduce the length of hospital stays and the incidence of complications, thereby reducing overall costs.", "type": "Document"}

It updates the CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain -United States, 2016 (MMWR Recomm Rep 2016;65[No. RR-1]:1-49) and includes recommendations for managing acute (duration of <1 month), subacute (duration of 1-3 months), and chronic (duration of >3 months) pain. The recommendations do not apply to pain related to sickle cell disease or cancer or to patients receiving palliative or end-of-life care. The guideline addresses the following four areas: 1) determining whether or not to initiate opioids for pain, 2) selecting opioids and determining opioid dosages, 3) deciding duration of initial opioid prescription and conducting follow-up, and 4) assessing risk and addressing potential harms of opioid use. CDC developed the guideline using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework. Recommendations are based on systematic reviews of the scientific evidence and reflect considerations of benefits and harms, patient and clinician values and preferences, and resource allocation. CDC obtained input from the Board of Scientific Counselors of the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (a federally chartered advisory committee), the public, and peer reviewers. CDC recommends that persons with pain receive appropriate pain treatment, with careful consideration of the benefits and risks of all treatment options in the context of the patient's circumstances. Recommendations should not be applied as inflexible standards of care across patient populations. This clinical practice guideline is intended to improve communication between clinicians and patients about the benefits and risks of pain treatments, including opioid therapy; improve the effectiveness and safety of pain treatment; mitigate pain; improve function and quality of life for patients with pain; and reduce risks associated with opioid pain therapy, including opioid use disorder, overdose, and death.", "type": "Document"}

Email: cdcinfo@cdc.gov. experienced \"high-impact\" chronic pain, defined as having pain on most days or every day during the past 3 months that limited life or work activities Pain is a complex phenomenon influenced by multiple factors, including biologic, psychological, and social factors Although substantial opportunity exists for improved pain management broadly across the United States, data underscore opportunities for addressing specific, long-standing health disparities Because of the clinical, psychological, and social consequences associated with pain, including limitations in activities, lost work productivity, reduced quality of life, and pervasive stigma, it is essential that clinicians have the training, education, guidance, and resources to provide appropriate, holistic, and compassionate care for patients with pain The range of therapeutic options has historically been inaccessible to many patients because of factors such as inadequate clinician education, training, and guidance; unconscious bias; a shortage of pain management specialists; insufficient access to treatment modalities such as behavioral therapy; siloed health systems; insurance coverage and reimbursement policies; and lack of clarity about the evidence supporting different pain treatments Opioids can be essential medications for the management of pain; however, they carry considerable potential risk. A systematic review published in 2014 by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) found insufficient evidence to demonstrate long-term benefits of prescription opioid treatment for chronic pain, and long-term prescription opioid use was found to be associated with increased risk for overdose and opioid misuse, among other risks In addition to the potential risks to patients, prescribed opioids have the potential for diversion and nonmedical use among persons to whom they were not prescribed CDC recognized the need for a national guideline on pain management that could improve appropriate opioid prescribing while minimizing opioid-related risks and released the CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain -United States, 2016 (referred to as the 2016 CDC Opioid Prescribing Guideline hereafter). The 2016 CDC Opioid Prescribing Guideline included 12 recommendations for the prescribing of opioids for chronic pain by primary care clinicians in outpatient settings, excluding active cancer treatment, palliative care, and end-of-life care The number of overall opioid prescriptions in the United States declined after 2012, and further declines have been observed after the release of the 2016 CDC Opioid Prescribing Guideline Although some laws, regulations, and policies that appear to support recommendations in the 2016 CDC Opioid Prescribing Guideline might have had positive results for some patients, they are inconsistent with a central tenet of the guideline: that the recommendations are voluntary and intended to be flexible to support, not supplant, individualized, patient-centered care. Of particular concern, some policies purportedly drawn from the 2016 CDC Opioid Prescribing Guideline have been notably inconsistent with it and have gone well beyond its clinical recommendations", "type": "Document"}

The draft clinical practice guideline was reviewed by an independent federal advisory committee (the Board of Scientific Counselors of the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control), peer reviewers, and the public and was revised after feedback from these reviews. Additional insights from patients, caregivers, and clinicians shared during virtual conversations held in 2020 were incorporated in the update. Importantly, to discourage the misapplication of opioid pain medication dosage thresholds as inflexible standards, revised recommendation statement language emphasizes principles such as avoiding increasing dosage above levels likely to yield diminishing returns in benefits relative to risks to patients. More-specific considerations related to dosage have been moved to implementation considerations that follow each recommendation statement, where more nuance is offered to inform clinical decision-making and individualized patient care.This clinical practice guideline provides recommendations but does not replace clinical judgment and individualized, patient-centered decision-making. The recommendations are based on emerging evidence, including observational studies or randomized clinical trials with notable limitations; thus, they should be considered in the context of the clinician-patient relationship built on shared understanding and a whole-person approach that considers such factors as the patient's physical and psychological functioning, support needs, expected health outcomes and well-being, home environment, and home and work responsibilities. Flexibility for clinicians and patients is paramount when making patient-centered clinical treatment decisions. The recommendations aim to improve US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ) and provides evidence-based recommendations for primary care and other clinicians (including physicians, nurse practitioners and other advanced practice registered nurses, physician assistants, and oral health practitioners) providing pain care, including those prescribing opioids, for outpatients aged \u226518 years with acute (duration of <1 month) pain, subacute (duration of 1-3 months) pain, or chronic (duration of >3 months) pain. Recommendations on use of opioids for acute pain and on tapering opioids for patients already receiving opioid therapy have been substantially expanded in this update. These recommendations do not apply to patients experiencing pain associated with the following conditions or settings: pain management related to sickle cell disease, cancer-related pain treatment, palliative care, and end-of-life care. Applicable outpatient settings include clinician offices, clinics, and urgent care centers. The recommendations do not apply to providing care to patients who are hospitalized or in an emergency department or other observational setting from which they might be admitted to inpatient care. These recommendations do apply to prescribing for pain management when patients are discharged from hospitals, emergency departments, or other facilities.This clinical practice guideline addresses the following areas:1. Determining whether or not to initiate opioids for pain 2. Selecting opioids and determining opioid dosages 3. Deciding duration of initial opioid prescription and conducting follow-up 4. Assessing risk and addressing potential harms of opioid use CDC developed this clinical practice guideline using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework, and recommendations are made based on a systematic review of the available scientific evidence while considering benefits and harms; values and preferences of patients, caregivers, and clinicians; and resource allocation (e.g., costs to patients or health systems, including clinician time). CDC obtained input on this clinical practice guideline through individual conversations with patients, caregivers, and clinicians and public comment opportunities available via Federal Register notices. CDC also sought input from the Board of Scientific Counselors of the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (BSC/NCIPC) (a federally chartered advisory committee), federal partners, and peer reviewers with scientific and clinical expertise.The clinical evidence reviews found that a number of nonpharmacologic treatments and a number of nonopioid medications are associated with improvements in pain, function, or both, that appear comparable to improvements associated with opioid use. Multiple noninvasive nonpharmacologic interventions (e.g., exercise and psychological therapies) are associated with improvements in pain, function, or both, that are sustained after treatment and are not associated with serious harms. Nonopioid drugs, including serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) antidepressants, pregabalin and gabapentin, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), are associated with small to moderate improvements in chronic pain and function for certain chronic pain conditions. Nonopioid drug class-specific adverse events include serious cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, or renal effects with NSAIDs and sedation with anticonvulsants. Opioid therapy is associated with similar or decreased effectiveness for pain and function versus NSAIDs across several acute pain conditions and with small improvements in short-term (1 to <6 months) pain and function compared with placebo; evidence was found of attenuated pain reduction over time with opioids (between 3 and 6 months versus between 1 and 3 months). Opioid therapy is associated with increased risk for serious harms (including opioid use disorder and overdose) that appears to increase with increase in opioid dosage, without a clear threshold below which there is no risk. No validated, reliable way exists to predict which patients will suffer serious harm from opioid therapy. Evidence was sparse for longterm improvement of pain or function for any treatment for chronic pain. Some evidence indicated that beneficial effects of some nonpharmacologic therapies persist for up to 12 months after the end of a course of a treatment. Among 154 trials of nonopioid medications rated as good or fair quality, eight were long term (\u22651 year). A single trial evaluated outcomes at 1 year for opioid medications (compared with nonopioid medications).Continued on the next page.", "type": "Document"}
{"id": null, "metadata": {"source": "cdc-guidelines-2022-opiods-for-pain.grobid.tei.txt", "chunk_id": 114, "char_count": 5804}, "page_content": "### Scope and Audience\nThis clinical practice guideline is intended for clinicians who are treating outpatients aged \u226518 years with acute (duration of <1 month), subacute (duration of 1-3 months), or chronic (duration of >3 months) pain, and excludes pain management related to sickle cell disease, cancer-related pain treatment, palliative care, and end-of-life care. The recommendations are most relevant to clinicians whose scope of practice includes prescribing opioids (e.g., physicians, nurse practitioners and other advanced-practice registered nurses, physician assistants, and oral health practitioners). Because clinicians might work within team-based care, this clinical practice guideline also refers to and promotes integrated pain management and collaborative working relationships among clinicians (e.g., behavioral health specialists such as social workers or psychologists, pharmacists, and registered nurses). This guideline update includes recommendations for primary care clinicians (e.g., internists and family physicians) and other clinicians managing pain in outpatient settings (e.g., surgeons, emergency medicine clinicians, occupational medicine clinicians, physical medicine and rehabilitation clinicians, and neurologists). Applicable settings include clinician offices, clinics, and urgent care centers. The recommendations do not apply to care provided to patients who are hospitalized or in an emergency department or other observational setting from which they might be admitted to inpatient care. These recommendations do apply to prescribing for pain management for patients when they are discharged from hospitals, emergency departments, or other facilities.In addition to updating recommendations on the basis of new evidence regarding management of chronic pain, this clinical practice guideline is intended to assist clinicians in weighing benefits and risks of prescribing opioid pain medication for painful acute conditions (e.g., low back pain, neck pain, other musculoskeletal pain, neuropathic pain, dental pain, kidney stone pain, and acute episodic migraine) and pain related to procedures (e.g., postoperative pain and pain from oral surgery). In 2020, several of these indications were prioritized by an ad hoc committee of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine The 2016 CDC Opioid Prescribing Guideline focused on recommendations for primary care physicians. This clinical practice guideline expands the scope to additional clinicians. Although primary care physicians prescribe approximately 37% of all opioid prescriptions, other clinicians, including pain medicine clinicians (8.9%) and dentists (8.6%), account for considerable proportions of prescriptions. Pain medicine and physical medicine and rehabilitation clinicians prescribe opioids at the highest rates, followed by orthopedic and family medicine clinicians Many principles of pain management are similar whether or not the treating clinician is a pain management specialist, and many of the recommendations might be relevant for pain management specialists. Many pain management specialists already follow principles outlined in this clinical practice guideline; however, use by pain management specialists is not the focus of this clinical practice guideline. Pain management specialists often have extensive training and expertise in pain management modalities that other clinicians do not, and they might treat patients with clinical situations that are more complex, less prevalent, and not well addressed by the available evidence; therefore, the balance of benefits and risks to patients might differ when the treating clinician is a pain management specialist.The recommendations address the use of opioid pain medication in certain special populations (e.g., older adults and pregnant persons) and in populations with conditions posing special risks (e.g., a history of a substance use disorder). The recommendations do not address the use of opioid pain medication in children or adolescents aged <18 years. The available evidence concerning the benefits and risks of longterm opioid therapy in children and adolescents remains limited, and few opioid medications provide information in their labeling regarding safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients. Guidelines and recommendations are available for pain management in children with sickle cell disease Although some principles in this clinical practice guideline might be helpful in the management of pain related to sickle cell disease, cancer-related pain treatment, palliative care, and end-of-life care, some recommendations might not be relevant for pain management in these contexts. Other guidelines more specifically address pain management in these situations This clinical practice guideline follows the Institute of Medicine's definition of palliative care as care that provides relief from pain and other symptoms, supports quality of life, and is focused on patients with serious advanced illness Recommendations on pain management for patients with cancer and patients who have survived cancer are available in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology: Adult Cancer Pain Although this update includes content on pain management for patients with opioid use disorder and one recommendation on management of opioid use disorder as a complication of opioid use, recommendations on opioids used specifically as medications for opioid use disorder are not the focus of this clinical practice guideline. More detailed recommendations on management of patients with opioid use disorder are available in the American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) National Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder: 2020 Focused Update", "type": "Document"}

CDC then requested the formation of an Opioid Workgroup (OWG), under the parent BSC, whose primary purpose would be to review a draft clinical practice guideline and to develop a report of their observations for BSC/NCIPC To provide background to BSC/NCIPC for informing the creation of OWG with a balance of perspectives, CDC identified audiences that would be 1) directly affected by the clinical practice guideline, 2) directly involved with implementing or integrating recommendations into current practice, and 3) qualified to represent a specific discipline or expertise in alignment with the tasks of the workgroup for consideration by BSC/NCIPC. Identified groups with perspectives that would support the workgroup's capacity included, but were not limited to, patients with pain, family members and caregivers, clinicians, public health practitioners, and research scientists. CDC announced the call for nominations at the December 4-5, 2019, public meeting and heard recommendations from the public during the public comment opportunities, as well as from BSC/NCIPC members, regarding recommendations for nominations. Persons interested in being considered for the workgroup were encouraged to submit self-nominations from December 4, 2019, through February 4, 2020.

Opioid therapy has an important role for acute pain related to severe traumatic injuries (including crush injuries and burns), invasive surgeries typically associated with moderate to severe postoperative pain, and other severe acute pain when NSAIDs and other therapies are contraindicated or likely to be ineffective.When diagnosis and severity of acute pain warrant the use of opioids, clinicians should prescribe immediate-release opioids (see Recommendation 3) at the lowest effective dose (see Recommendation 4) and for no longer than the expected duration of pain severe enough to require opioids (see Recommendation 6) to minimize unintentional initiation of long-term opioid use. Clinicians should maximize use of nonopioid pharmacologic (e.g., NSAIDs, acetaminophen, or both) and nonpharmacologic (e.g., ice, heat, elevation, rest, immobilization, or exercise) therapies as appropriate for the specific condition and continue these therapies as needed after opioids are discontinued. Clinicians should work with patients to prevent prolonged opioid use, prescribe and advise opioid use only as needed (e.g., hydrocodone 5 mg/acetaminophen 325 mg, one tablet not more frequently than every 4 hours as needed for moderate to severe pain) rather than on a scheduled basis (e.g., one tablet every 4 hours), and encourage and include an opioid taper if opioids will be taken around the clock for more than a few days (see Although findings regarding risks for new long-term opioid use after use for acute pain Patient education and discussion before starting outpatient opioid therapy are critical so that patient preferences and values can be understood and used to inform clinical decisions. Clinicians should ensure that patients are aware of expected benefits of, common risks of, serious risks of, and alternatives to opioids before starting or continuing opioid therapy and should involve patients in decisions about whether to start opioid therapy. Essential elements for communication and discussion with patients before prescribing outpatient opioid therapy for acute pain include the following:\u2022 Advise patients that short-term opioid use can lead to unintended long-term opioid use and of the importance of working toward planned discontinuation of opioid use as soon as feasible, including a plan to appropriately taper opioids as pain resolves if opioids have been used around the clock for more than a few days (see \u2022 Review communication mechanisms and protocols patients can use to tell clinicians of severe or uncontrolled pain and to arrange for timely reassessment and management. \u2022 Advise patients about serious adverse effects of opioids, including potentially fatal respiratory depression and development of a potentially serious opioid use disorder (see Recommendation 12) that can cause distress and inability to fulfill major role obligations at work, school, or home. \u2022 Advise patients about common effects of opioids, such as constipation, dry mouth, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, confusion, tolerance, physical dependence, and withdrawal symptoms when stopping opioids. To prevent constipation associated with opioid use, advise patients to increase hydration and fiber intake and to maintain or increase physical activity as they are able. Prophylactic pharmacologic therapy (e.g., a stimulant laxative such as senna, with or without a stool softener) might be needed to ensure regular bowel movements if opioids are used for more than a few days. Stool softeners or fiber laxatives without another laxative should be avoided. To minimize withdrawal symptoms, clinicians should provide and discuss an opioid tapering plan when opioids will be used around the clock for more than a few days (see Limiting opioid use to the minimum needed to manage pain (e.g., taking the opioid only when needed if needed less frequently than every 4 hours and the prescription is written for every 4 hours as needed for pain) can help limit development of tolerance and therefore withdrawal after opioids are discontinued. \u2022 If formulations are prescribed that combine opioids with acetaminophen, advise patients of the risks of taking additional over-the-counter products containing acetaminophen. \u2022 To help patients assess when a dose of opioids is needed, explain that the goal is to reduce pain to make it manageable rather than to eliminate pain. \u2022 Discuss effects that opioids might have on a person's ability to safely operate a vehicle or other machinery, particularly when opioids are initiated or when other central nervous system depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines or alcohol) are used concurrently. \u2022 Discuss the potential for workplace toxicology testing programs to detect therapeutic opioid use. \u2022 Discuss increased risks for opioid use disorder, respiratory depression, and death at higher dosages, along with the importance of taking only the amount of opioids prescribed (i.e., not taking more opioids than prescribed or taking them more often).", "type": "Document"}

Physical therapy can be helpful, particularly for patients who have limited access to safe public spaces or public recreation facilities for exercise or whose pain has not improved with low-intensity physical exercise. \u2022 Health insurers and health systems can improve pain management and reduce medication use and associated risks by increasing reimbursement for and access to noninvasive nonpharmacologic therapies with evidence for effectiveness. \u2022 Clinicians should review FDA-approved labeling, including boxed warnings, and weigh benefits and risks before initiating treatment with any pharmacologic therapy. \u2022 When patients affected by osteoarthritis have an insufficient response to nonpharmacologic interventions such as exercise for arthritis pain, topical NSAIDs can be used in patients with pain in a single or few joints near the surface of the skin (e.g., knee). For patients with osteoarthritis pain in multiple joints or incompletely controlled with topical NSAIDs, duloxetine or systemic NSAIDs can be considered. \u2022 NSAIDs should be used at the lowest effective dose and shortest duration needed and should be used with caution, particularly in older adults and in patients with cardiovascular comorbidities, chronic renal failure, or previous gastrointestinal bleeding. \u2022 When patients with chronic low back pain have had an insufficient response to nonpharmacologic approaches such as exercise, clinicians can consider NSAIDs or duloxetine for patients without contraindications. \u2022 Tricyclic, tetracyclic, and SNRI antidepressants; selected anticonvulsants (e.g., pregabalin, gabapentin enacarbil, oxcarbazepine); and capsaicin and lidocaine patches can be considered for neuropathic pain. In older adults, decisions to use tricyclic antidepressants should be made judiciously on a case-by-case basis because of risks for confusion and falls. \u2022 Duloxetine and pregabalin are FDA-approved for the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy, and pregabalin and gabapentin are FDA-approved for treatment of postherpetic neuralgia. \u2022 In patients with fibromyalgia, tricyclic (e.g., amitriptyline) and SNRI antidepressants (e.g., duloxetine, milnacipran), NSAIDs (e.g., topical diclofenac), and specific anticonvulsants (i.e., pregabalin and gabapentin) are used to improve pain, function, and quality of life. Duloxetine, milnacipran, and pregabalin are FDA-approved for the treatment of fibromyalgia. In older adults, decisions to use tricyclic antidepressants should be made judiciously on a case-by-case basis because of risks for confusion and falls. \u2022 Patients with co-occurring pain and depression might be especially likely to benefit from antidepressant medication (see Recommendation 8). \u2022 Opioids should not be considered first-line or routine therapy for subacute or chronic pain. This does not mean that patients should be required to sequentially fail nonpharmacologic and nonopioid pharmacologic therapy or be required to use any specific treatment before proceeding to opioid therapy. Rather, expected benefits specific to the clinical context should be weighed against risks before initiating therapy. In some clinical contexts (e.g., serious illness in a patient with poor prognosis for return to previous level of function, contraindications to other therapies, and clinician and patient agreement that the overriding goal is patient comfort), opioids might be appropriate regardless of previous therapies used. In other situations (e.g., headache or fibromyalgia), expected benefits of initiating opioids are unlikely to outweigh risks regardless of previous nonpharmacologic and nonopioid pharmacologic therapies used. \u2022 Opioid therapy should not be initiated without consideration by the clinician and patient of an exit strategy to be used if opioid therapy is unsuccessful. \u2022 Before opioid therapy is initiated for subacute or chronic pain, clinicians should determine jointly with patients how functional benefit will be evaluated and establish specific, measurable treatment goals. \u2022 For patients with subacute pain who started opioid therapy for acute pain and have been treated with opioid therapy for \u226530 days, clinicians should ensure that potentially reversible causes of chronic pain are addressed and that opioid prescribing for acute pain does not unintentionally become long-term opioid therapy simply because medications are continued without reassessment. Continuation of opioid therapy at this point might represent initiation of long-term opioid therapy, which should occur only as an intentional decision that benefits are likely to outweigh risks after informed discussion between the clinician and patient and as part of a comprehensive pain management approach. \u2022 Clinicians should review available low-cost options for pain management for all patients and particularly for patients who have low incomes, do not have health insurance, or have inadequate insurance. \u2022 Clinicians should ensure that patients are aware of expected benefits of, common risks of, serious risks of, and alternatives to opioids before starting or continuing opioid therapy and should involve patients in decisions about whether to start opioid therapy.", "type": "Document"}

Compared with no opioid use, opioid use was associated with increased risk for opioid use disorder, overdose, all-cause deaths, fractures, falls, and myocardial infarction Multiple experts from OWG stated that they appreciated this recommendation because of the importance of highlighting both pain and function, sharing realistic expectations with patients before initiating treatment, and paying attention to tapering and exit strategies. Although some experts reasoned the recommendation statement could state nonopioid therapies \"may be preferred\" or \"may be effective\" for chronic pain, others agreed with language that nonopioid therapies \"are preferred\" for chronic pain because opioid therapies are associated with small short-term benefits compared with placebo, comparable or reduced short-term benefits compared with nonopioid therapies, uncertain long-term benefits, and potential for serious harms.Opioids should not be considered first-line or routine therapy for subacute or chronic pain. Although evidence on long-term benefits of nonopioid therapies also is limited, these therapies also are associated with short-term benefits, no evidence exists for attenuated benefit over time or difficulty stopping therapy when benefits do not outweigh risks, and risks for serious harms are usually lower.

Clinicians US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention should ensure that patients are aware of expected benefits of, common risks of, serious risks of, and alternatives to opioids before starting or continuing opioid therapy and should involve patients in decisions about whether to start opioid therapy.

Because of the longer half-life and longer duration of effects (e.g., respiratory depression) of ER/LA opioids (e.g., methadone, fentanyl patches, or extended-release versions of oxycodone, hydromorphone, hydrocodone, or morphine), clinicians should not prescribe ER/LA opioids for the treatment of acute pain. ER/LA opioids should be reserved for severe, continuous pain and should be considered only for patients who have received certain dosages of immediate-release opioids daily (e.g., 60 mg daily of oral morphine, 30 mg daily of oral oxycodone, or equianalgesic dosages of other opioids) for at least 1 week When an ER/LA opioid is prescribed, using one with predictable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics is preferred to minimize unintentional overdose risk. In particular, unique characteristics of methadone and transdermal fentanyl make safe prescribing of these medications for pain especially challenging. Methadone should not be the first choice for an ER/LA opioid. Only clinicians who are familiar with methadone's unique risk profile and who are prepared to educate and closely monitor their patients, including risk assessment for QT prolongation and consideration of electrocardiographic monitoring, should consider prescribing methadone for pain.

Further, these recommendations apply specifically to starting opioids or to increasing opioid dosages, and a different set of benefits and risks applies to reducing opioid dosages (see Recommendation 5). 3) Do not use the calculated dose in MMEs to determine the doses to use when converting one opioid to another; when converting opioids, the new opioid is typically dosed at a substantially lower dose than the calculated MME dose to avoid overdose because of incomplete cross-tolerance and individual variability in opioid pharmacokinetics. 4) Use particular caution with methadone dose conversions because methadone has a long and variable half-life, and peak respiratory depressant effect occurs later and lasts longer than peak analgesic effect. 5) Use particular caution with transdermal fentanyl because it is dosed in mcg/hr instead of mg/day, and its absorption is affected by heat and other factors. 6) Buprenorphine products approved for the treatment of pain are not included in the table because of their partial \u00b5-receptor agonist activity and resultant ceiling effects compared with full \u00b5-receptor agonists. 7) These conversion factors should not be applied to dosage decisions related to the management of opioid use disorder. \u2020 Tapentadol is a \u00b5-receptor agonist and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor.

Few trials evaluated opioid dosages of \u226590 MME/day At the same time, risks for serious harms related to opioid therapy, including opioid misuse, overdose, and death, increase at higher opioid dosage, without a single point below which there is no risk Four observational studies identified in the clinical evidence reviews consistently found an association between higher doses of long-term opioids and risk for overdose or overdose death Multiple experts from OWG expressed concern that including specific dosage thresholds in a main recommendation statement would emphasize them as authoritative absolutes and would lead to noncollaborative tapers or other potentially harmful consequences. Experts also noted the lack of a single standard formula for calculating MMEs When opioids are used for acute, subacute, or chronic pain, clinicians should start opioids at the lowest possible effective dosage. For patients not already taking opioids, the lowest effective dose can be determined using product labeling as a starting point with calibration as needed on the basis of the severity of pain and other clinical factors, such as renal or hepatic insufficiency (see Clinicians should generally avoid unnecessary dosage increases, use caution when increasing opioid dosages, and increase dosage by the smallest practical amount because overdose risk increases with increases in opioid dosage. Although evidence to recommend specific intervals for dosage titration is limited, rapid dosage increases put patients at greater risk for sedation, respiratory depression, and overdose. For opioid-na\u00efve outpatients with acute pain treated with an opioid for a few days or less, dosage increases are usually unnecessary and should not be attempted without close monitoring because of the risks for respiratory depression. In the context of longterm opioid use, when dosage is increased, clinicians should reevaluate patients after increasing dosage for changes in pain, function, and risk for harm (see Before increasing total opioid dosage to \u226550 MME/day, clinicians should pause, considering that dosage increases to >50 MME/day are unlikely to provide substantially improved pain control for most patients while overdose risk increases with dosage, and carefully reassess evidence of benefits and risks. If a patient's opioid dosage for all sources of opioids combined reaches or exceeds 50 MME/day, clinicians should implement additional precautions, including increased frequency of follow-up (see Additional dosage increases beyond 50 MME/day are progressively more likely to yield diminishing returns in benefits for pain and function relative to risks to patients. Clinicians should carefully evaluate a decision to increase dosage after an individualized assessment of benefits and risks and weighing factors such as diagnosis, incremental benefits for pain and function relative to risks with previous dosage increases, other treatments and effectiveness, and patient values and preferences.Certain states require clinicians to implement clinical protocols at specific dosage levels. For example, before increasing long-term opioid therapy dosage to >120 MME/day, clinicians in Washington state must obtain consultation from a pain specialist who agrees that the increase is indicated and appropriate", "type": "Document"}

Opioid therapy should be limited to circumstances where benefits of therapy outweigh risks. Because tapering opioids can be harmful in some circumstances, benefits of continuing opioids in patients who have already received them long-term might include avoiding risks of tapering and discontinuing opioids. In situations where benefits and risks of continuing opioids are considered to be close or unclear, shared decision-making with patients is particularly important. At times, clinicians and patients might not be able to agree on whether tapering is necessary. When patients and clinicians are unable to arrive at a consensus on the assessment of benefits and risks, clinicians should acknowledge this discordance, express empathy, and seek to implement treatment changes in a patient-centered manner while avoiding patient abandonment. Unless there is a life-threatening issue such as warning signs of an imminent overdose, the benefits of rapidly tapering or abruptly discontinuing opioids are unlikely to outweigh the substantial risks of these practices Consistent with the HHS Guide for Clinicians on the Appropriate Dosage Reduction or Discontinuation of Long-Term Opioid Analgesics \u2022 the patient requests dosage reduction or discontinuation,\u2022 pain improves and might indicate resolution of an underlying cause, \u2022 opioid therapy has not meaningfully reduced pain or improved function, \u2022 the patient has been treated with opioids for a prolonged period (e.g., years) and the benefit-risk balance is unclear (e.g., decreased positive effects because of tolerance and symptoms such as reduced focus or memory that might be due to opioids), \u2022 the patient is receiving higher opioid dosages without evidence of benefit from the higher dosage, \u2022 the patient experiences side effects that diminish quality of life or impair function, \u2022 evidence of opioid misuse exists, \u2022 the patient experiences an overdose or other serious event (e.g., an event leading to hospitalization or injury) or has warning signs for an impending event (e.g., confusion, sedation, or slurred speech), or \u2022 the patient is receiving medications (e.g., benzodiazepines) or has medical conditions (e.g., sleep apnea, liver disease, kidney disease, or fall risk) that increase risk for adverse outcomes. For patients already taking opioids long term (both established patients and patients transferring from other clinicians), the possibility of opioid dosage reduction might provoke substantial anxiety. In addition, tapering opioids after years of taking them can be especially challenging because of physical and psychological dependence. However, patients should be offered the opportunity to reevaluate their continued use of opioids. Clinicians should review benefits and risks of continued opioid therapy with empathy.Whenever possible, clinicians should collaborate with patients and share decision-making about whether and how to taper opioids.

Analysis of nationwide U.S. commercial insurance claims in 2014 found median durations of initial opioid analgesic prescriptions for acute pain indications in primary care settings were 4-7 days (244), suggesting that in most cases, clinicians considered an initial opioid prescription of 4-7 days' duration sufficient. Some patients (17.8%; range: 11.7%-30.0% depending on the acute pain condition) obtained at least one refill within 30 days after their initial opioid prescription, suggesting that although these durations might have been sufficient or more than necessary for most patients, variation across diagnoses and among patients in time to recovery is likely. In an older study of the course of acute low back pain (not associated with malignancies, infections, spondyloarthropathies, fractures, or neurologic signs) in a primary care setting, a large decrease in pain occurred until the fourth day after treatment with paracetamol, with smaller decreases thereafter Since 2017, multiple studies have found that many patients do not use all prescribed opioids after surgery and that prescribing a lower quantity of opioids postoperatively is associated with less opioid use without increases in pain score or in requests for refills of pain medication and without reductions in satisfaction with pain management Clinical evidence reviews found observational evidence that opioid use for acute pain is associated with long-term opioid use and that a greater amount of early opioid exposure is associated with greater likelihood of long-term use, noting recent evidence for a dose-and duration-dependent effects Many common causes of nonsurgical, nontraumatic acute pain can often be managed without opioids (see Recommendation 1). When the diagnosis and severity of acute pain warrant the use of opioids, clinicians should prescribe no greater quantity than needed for the expected duration of pain severe enough to require opioids. A few days or less are often sufficient when opioids are needed for many common causes of nonsurgical acute pain, and limiting the duration of opioid therapy can minimize the need to taper to prevent withdrawal symptoms at the end of the course of opioids and limit unused opioids. Certain circumstances (e.g., severe traumatic injuries) might require use of opioids for durations of >7 days. Durations should be individualized based on the patient's clinical circumstances.When patients are discharged from the hospital after surgery, the course and dosage of any opioid medications administered during hospitalization and before discharge can help predict ongoing pain management needs Clinicians should generally not prescribe additional opioids to patients just in case pain continues longer than expected. However, if pain continues longer than expected, some patients might face challenges in successfully navigating the health care system (e.g., clinician and pharmacy contact, transportation, and need for assistance) to obtain additional medication as needed, leading to potential disparities in treatment. Clinicians, practices, and health systems should have mechanisms in place for the subset of patients who experience severe acute pain that continues longer than the expected duration. These mechanisms should allow for timely reevaluation to confirm or revise the initial diagnosis and adjust pain management accordingly. In particular, clinicians, practices, and health systems should ensure all patients can obtain and afford additional evaluation and treatment as needed to minimize disparities in access to and affordability of care and refills.Patients should be evaluated at least every 2 weeks if they continue to receive opioids for acute pain. If opioids are continued for \u22651 month, clinicians should ensure that potentially reversible causes of chronic pain are addressed and that opioid prescribing for acute pain does not unintentionally become long-term opioid therapy simply because medications are continued without reassessment. Continuation of opioid therapy at this point might represent initiation of long-term opioid therapy, which should occur only as an intentional decision that benefits are likely to outweigh risks after discussion between the clinician and patient and as part of a comprehensive pain management approach. Clinicians should refer to recommendations on subacute and chronic pain for initiation (Recommendation 2), follow-up (Recommendation 7), and tapering (Recommendation 5) of ongoing opioid therapy. If patients already receiving longterm opioids require additional opioids for superimposed severe acute pain (e.g., major surgery), opioids should be continued only for the duration of pain severe enough to require additional opioids, returning to the patient's baseline opioid dosage as soon as possible, including a taper to baseline dosage if additional opioids were used around the clock for more than a few days.If opioids are used continuously (around the clock) for more than a few days for acute pain, clinicians should prescribe a brief taper to minimize withdrawal symptoms on discontinuation of opioids. Taper durations might need to be adjusted depending on the duration of the initial opioid prescription. For example, if opioids are used continuously for >3 days but for <1 week, clinicians can consider reducing the daily dosage to 50% for 2 days to ameliorate withdrawal symptoms when discontinuing opioids. When patients have taken opioids continuously for \u22651 week but <1 month, clinicians might consider a slower taper (e.g., reducing the daily dosage by approximately 20% every 2 days, a range consistent with tapering rates successfully used in studies of postoperative opioid prescribing)", "type": "Document"}

Clinicians should ensure that opioid prescribing for acute pain does not unintentionally become long-term opioid therapy simply because medications are continued without reassessment, but only as an intentional decision that benefits are likely to outweigh risks after discussion between the clinician and patient. Clinicians should reassess the patient's pain, function, and treatment course; ensure that potentially reversible causes of chronic pain are addressed; and optimize pain management as needed (see In analyses of placebo-controlled trials, the clinical evidence reviews found that effects of opioids on mean improvement in pain and in function were greater at 1-3 months than at 3-6 months At follow-up, clinicians should review patient perspectives on progress and challenges in moving toward treatment goals; determine whether opioids continue to meet treatment goals, including sustained improvement in pain and function; determine whether the patient has experienced common or serious adverse events or early warning signs of serious adverse events or has signs of opioid misuse or opioid use disorder (e.g., difficulty controlling use, cravings, work, and social or family problems related to opioid use); determine whether benefits of opioids continue to outweigh risks; and determine whether there is a need for opioid dosage reduction or discontinuation. Clinicians should assess benefits in function, pain control, and quality of life by asking patients about progress toward personcentered functional goals that have meaning for them (see Recommendation 2) or by using tools such as the three-item PEG assessment scale If risks outweigh benefits of continued opioid therapy (e.g., if patients do not experience meaningful, sustained improvements in pain and function compared with before initiation of opioid therapy; if patients are taking higher-risk regimens [e.g., dosages of \u226550 MME/day or opioids combined with benzodiazepines] without evidence of benefit; if patients believe benefits no longer outweigh risks; if patients request dosage reduction or discontinuation; or if patients experience overdose or other serious adverse events), clinicians should work with patients to taper and reduce opioid dosage or to taper and discontinue opioids when possible (see", "type": "Document"}

A clinical evidence review did not find studies evaluating the effectiveness of PDMPs for risk mitigation Special attention should be paid to ensure that PDMP information is not used in a way that is harmful to patients. For example, PDMP information has been used to dismiss patients from clinician practices Experts raised varying points regarding frequency of PDMP use, with many agreeing that PDMPs should be consulted before every opioid prescription, several agreeing that universal application would mitigate bias in application to different patients, and others believing it might not be warranted or feasible to check the PDMP in all cases, particularly before prescribing opioids for acute pain for a small number of days.Ideally, PDMP data should be reviewed before every opioid prescription for acute, subacute, or chronic pain. This practice is recommended in all jurisdictions where PDMP availability and access policies make it practicable (e.g., clinician and delegate access permitted). At a minimum, PDMP data should be reviewed before initial opioid prescriptions for subacute or chronic pain and then every 3 months or more frequently during long-term opioid therapy. Recommendation category B acknowledges variation in PDMP availability and circumstances (e.g., a clinician might reasonably determine that a patient with severe acute pain in the emergency department during a PDMP system access failure would be adversely affected by waiting hours for a prescription). However, because PDMP information can be most helpful when results are unexpected and, to minimize bias in application, clinicians should apply this recommendation when feasible to all patients rather than differentially on the basis of assumptions about what they will learn about specific patients.Clinicians should review PDMP data for prescription opioids and other controlled medications patients might have received from additional prescribers to determine the total amount of MME prescribed and to assess if the total dosage or combinations (e.g., opioids combined with benzodiazepines) put the patient at high risk for overdose.

However, concurrent use of opioid pain medications with other opioid pain medications, benzodiazepines, or heroin or other nonpharmaceutical opioids can increase patients' risk for overdose. Toxicology tests can provide information about drug use that is not reported by the patient. In addition, toxicology tests can assist clinicians in identifying when patients are not taking opioids prescribed for them, which might in certain cases indicate diversion or other clinically important issues such as difficulties with adverse effects. The most commonly drug-tested bodily specimen is urine. Oral fluid (saliva) testing also is available On October 25, 2019, SAMHSA published guidelines for the inclusion of oral fluid specimens in toxicology testing programs of federal executive branch agencies Experts from OWG had concerns that biases and disparities affecting which patients undergo toxicology testing could have disproportionately negative consequences among Black and Hispanic patients. In addition, testing costs would have the greatest consequences for patients with the least ability to pay. Because of these concerns, some experts said that grading the recommendation as category A could potentially reduce bias and disparities. However, others indicated that although universal application could mitigate bias in who is tested, it would not mitigate stigma associated with testing. In addition, experts had concerns about accuracy, clinician interpretation, testing costs, and potential for a delay in care while waiting for test results.Because of these concerns, the recommendation is rated category B. However, clinicians, practices, and health systems should aim to minimize bias in its application and should not apply this recommendation differentially on the basis of assumptions about what they will learn about specific patients. Predicting risk is challenging, and available tools do not allow clinicians to reliably identify patients who are at low risk for substance use disorder Before starting opioids and periodically (at least annually) during opioid therapy, clinicians should consider benefits and risks of toxicology testing to assess for prescribed opioids and other prescription and nonprescribed substances that increase risk for overdose when combined with opioids, including nonprescribed and illicit opioids and benzodiazepines. Before ordering toxicology testing, clinicians should have a plan for responding to unexpected results. Clinicians should explain to patients that toxicology testing will not be used punitively (e.g., will not be used to dismiss patients from care) and is intended to improve their safety. Clinicians should also explain expected results (e.g., presence of prescribed medication and absence of substances, including nonprescribed substances, not reported by the patient). Clinicians should ask patients about use of prescribed medications and other substances and ask whether there might be unexpected results. This will provide an opportunity for patients to provide information about changes in their use of prescribed opioids or other drugs.In most situations, initial toxicology testing can be performed with a relatively inexpensive immunoassay panel that tests for opiates and benzodiazepines as classes and for multiple nonprescribed substances. Patients prescribed oxycodone or nonmorphine-based opioids (e.g., buprenorphine or methadone) require specific testing for those agents. The use of confirmatory testing can add costs and should be used when toxicology results will inform decisions with major clinical or nonclinical implications for the patient, a need exists to detect a specific opioid that is prescribed or that cannot be identified on standard immunoassays, or to confirm unexpected toxicology screening results for which there is no other explanation. Clinicians and health systems can work to minimize inequitable cost burdens for patients and limit specific testing to situations when it is necessary. Clinicians should be familiar with the compounds included in toxicology testing panels used in their practice and should understand how to interpret results. For example, a positive opiate immunoassay test result detects morphine, which might reflect patient use of morphine, codeine, or heroin, but this immunoassay does not detect synthetic opioids (e.g., fentanyl or methadone) and might not detect semisynthetic opioids (e.g., oxycodone or buprenorphine). Many laboratories use an oxycodone immunoassay that detects oxycodone and oxymorphone; however, these agents might need to be ordered or identified separately in a toxicology testing panel. In some cases, positive results for specific opioids might reflect metabolites from opioids the patient is taking and might not mean the patient is taking the specific opioid for which the test was positive. For example, hydromorphone is a metabolite of hydrocodone, and oxymorphone is a metabolite of oxycodone. Detailed considerations for interpretation of urine toxicology test results, including which tests to order and expected results, drug detection time in urine, and drug metabolism, have been published previously Clinicians might want to discuss unexpected results with the local laboratory or toxicologist and should discuss unexpected results with the patient. Discussion with patients before specific confirmatory testing can sometimes yield a candid explanation of why a particular substance is present or absent and obviate the need for confirmatory testing on that visit. For example, a patient might explain that the test is negative for prescribed opioids because they felt opioids were no longer helping and discontinued them. If unexpected results are not explained, a confirmatory test using a method selective enough to differentiate specific opioids and metabolites (e.g., gas or liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry) might be warranted to clarify the situation.Clinicians should use unexpected results to improve patient safety (e.g., change pain management strategy [see Clinicians should not dismiss patients from care on the basis of a toxicology test result.

Epidemiologic studies find concurrent benzodiazepine use in large proportions of opioid-related overdose deaths Experts from OWG noted that rather than necessarily being a direct cause of overdose, benzodiazepines might serve as a marker of risk for overdose because of underlying conditions, in specific situations benzodiazepines can be beneficial, and that stopping benzodiazepines can be destabilizing. In addition, experts noted that long-term, stable use might be safer than erratic, unpredictable use. Because of these considerations, multiple experts indicated that recommending extreme caution with concurrent prescription of opioid pain medications and benzodiazepines was more appropriate than a recommendation to avoid prescribing opioid pain medication and benzodiazepines concurrently and that category B would be more appropriate than category A for this recommendation.Although in certain circumstances it might be appropriate to prescribe opioids to a patient receiving benzodiazepines (e.g., severe acute pain in a patient taking long-term, stable low-dosage benzodiazepine therapy), clinicians should use particular caution when prescribing opioid pain medication and benzodiazepines concurrently. In addition, because other central nervous system depressants (e.g., muscle relaxants, nonbenzodiazepine sedative hypnotics, and potentially sedating anticonvulsant medications such as gabapentin and pregabalin) In patients receiving opioids and benzodiazepines longterm, clinicians should carefully weigh the benefits and risks of continuing therapy with opioids and benzodiazepines and discuss with patients and other members of the patient's care team, as appropriate. In specific situations, benzodiazepines can be beneficial, and stopping benzodiazepines can be destabilizing. As emphasized in an FDA advisory If risks are determined to outweigh benefits of continuing opioids for pain and benzodiazepine therapy at current dosages, decisions about tapering medications (e.g., whether to taper opioids first, taper benzodiazepines first, or consider carefully transitioning from full agonist opioids to buprenorphine before tapering benzodiazepines) should be individualized and reevaluated over time. Considerations include patient priorities, the patient's clinical considerations, the patient's response to therapeutic changes, consultation with other clinicians managing the patient's care, and, consultation with other specialists (e.g., an addiction specialist) if needed.

Experts from OWG stated that partial agonist opioid, full agonist opioid, and opioid antagonist treatment should not be framed as equal options for opioid use disorder, noting that partial and full agonist opioid treatments have stronger evidence for better outcomes, do not require abstinence, have less challenges with initiation, and are much more widely used than opioid antagonist treatment.

The reviews also prompted CDC to modify the recommendations to include acute and subacute pain more explicitly. This updated clinical practice guideline also includes a new topline recommendation for patients who are already receiving ongoing opioid therapy for pain. Specifically, the clinical practice guideline outlines how clinicians and patients should work together in assessing the benefits and risks of continued opioid use and if or when to taper opioids to a lower dosage or discontinue opioids altogether in accordance with the HHS Tapering Guide Four key areas are covered in this clinical practice guideline for prescribing of opioid pain medication for patients aged \u226518 years for pain, excluding pain management related to sickle cell disease, cancer-related pain treatment, palliative care, and end-of-life care. These areas are 1) determining whether or not to initiate opioids for pain; 2) selecting opioids and determining opioid dosages; 3) deciding duration of initial opioid prescription and conducting follow-up; and 4) assessing risk and addressing potential harms of opioid use. In addition, five guiding principles were identified to inform implementation across recommendations. These guiding principles focus on 1) the appropriate treatment of pain; 2) flexibility to meet the care needs and clinical circumstances of each patient; 3) a multimodal and multidisciplinary approach to pain management; 4) avoiding misapplication of the clinical practice guideline beyond its intended use; and 5) vigilance in attending to health inequities and ensuring access to appropriate, affordable, diversified, coordinated, and effective nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic pain treatment for all persons.A central tenet of this clinical practice guideline is that acute, subacute, and chronic pain needs to be appropriately and effectively treated regardless of whether opioids are part of a treatment regimen. Clinicians should select nonpharmacologic or pharmacologic treatment modalities, or both, that maximize patient safety and optimize outcomes in pain, function, and quality of life. A multimodal and multidisciplinary approach to pain management that considers the biologic, psychological, and social characteristics of each person is critical An integral part of providing access to and delivery of highquality health care, including pain treatment, is understanding how the social determinants of health influence the health care provided and the differential outcomes observed Outcomes such as function and quality of life also are influenced by the health care context To avoid unintended consequences for patients, this clinical practice guideline should not be misapplied, or policies derived from it, beyond its intended use This clinical practice guideline provides overarching voluntary recommendations on the use of opioids to manage pain. To assist in the uptake and understanding of this new clinical practice guideline, CDC will provide tools and resources for clinicians, health systems, patients, and others on the use of opioid and nonopioid pain treatments. The uptake and widespread use of the 2016 CDC Opioid Prescribing Guideline hinged on its successful dissemination, and CDC supported its translation and integration in clinical practice. CDC produced a checklist and mobile app so clinicians could more readily apply guideline recommendations; developed fact sheets, posters, and public service announcements to make the guideline more accessible and understandable to clinicians and patients; and developed a 14-module interactive, webbased training with self-paced learning, case-based content, knowledge checks, and integrated resources for clinicians CDC will work with public and private payers by sharing evidence that can be used to inform decisions about coverage for nonpharmacologic treatments, access to nonopioid pain medication, support for patient counseling and coordination of care, access to evidence-based treatments of opioid use disorder, and availability of multidisciplinary and multimodal care. Robust coverage and access (e.g., limited utilization management and cost sharing for evidence-based treatments) and decision support (e.g., adjustment of EHR prescribing defaults) can be used to facilitate and encourage evidence-based treatments as default treatments for pain This clinical practice guideline updates and expands the recommendations in the 2016 CDC Opioid Prescribing Guideline using the best available evidence as interpreted and informed by expert opinion and attending to the values and preferences expressed by patients, caregivers, and clinicians. Although the strength of the evidence is sometimes low quality and research gaps remain (Box 5), clinical scientific evidence continues to advance and supports the recommendations in this clinical practice guideline The principal aim of this clinical practice guideline is to ensure persons have equitable access to safe and effective pain management that improves their function and quality of life while illuminating and reducing risks associated with prescription opioids. CDC will evaluate this clinical practice guideline to identify the effects of the recommendations on clinician and patient outcomes and on health disparities, including intended and unintended consequences. Communication between clinicians and patients about the benefits and risks of opioids should be central to treatment decisions for patients in pain. This clinical practice guideline can help inform those decisions and assist clinicians in meeting the unique needs of each person. CDC will revisit this clinical practice guideline when remaining evidence gaps have sufficiently been addressed and another update is warranted. US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention BOX 5. Areas for additional research to build the evidence base for optimal pain management \u2022 Efficacy of screening tools to assess risk for opioid misuse and developing an opioid use disorder. Across reviews, the main outcomes were pain, function, and quality of life. Harms varied depending on the therapy evaluated but included serious adverse events when reported; for opioids, key harms included overdose and harms related to opioid use disorder. The reviews of therapies for chronic pain assessed outcomes at short-(1 to <6 months), intermediate-(6 to <12 months), and long-term follow-up (\u226512 months). The reviews of therapies for acute pain assessed outcomes at <1 day, 1 day to <1 week, 1 week to <2 weeks, and 2-4 weeks; the review of treatments for acute nonmigraine pain also evaluated outcomes at \u22654 weeks. All reviews included key questions (KQs) or subquestions on how benefits and harms varied according to demographic (age, sex, race), clinical (severity and duration of pain, medical and psychiatric comorbidities, concomitant medications), and intervention (dose, duration, intensity) characteristics.The systematic clinical evidence reviews addressed questions regarding the effectiveness and comparative effectiveness of noninvasive nonpharmacologic treatments; nonopioid pharmacologic treatments; and opioid treatments for chronic pain, acute pain, and episodic migraine pain (details including questions are available in the full AHRQ reports) (1-5).", "type": "Document"}

Few serious adverse events and no difference between opioids versus placebo in risk were reported in the short-term trials (evidence type 2); however, serious adverse events were not well defined by the trials, the trials excluded patients at higher risk (e.g., those with a history of substance use disorder), and the trials were not designed to assess serious but less common harms such as overdose, opioid use disorder death, cardiovascular events, and fractures. EERW studies tended to report lower risk with opioids of discontinuation because of adverse events and gastrointestinal adverse events than non-EERW studies. Uncontrolled studies (studies without a nonopioid control group) were not included in the AHRQ review, although a recent systematic review with such studies found that rates of misuse ranged from 21% to 29% (95% CI: 13%-38%) and rates of addiction ranged from 8% to 12% (95% CI: 3%-17%), based on higher-quality observational evidence As in the 2014 AHRQ report and 2016 CDC update, the clinical evidence review identified no long-term (>1 year) randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of opioid therapy versus placebo. One new cohort study found long-term opioid therapy was not associated with improved pain, function, or other outcomes versus no opioids No differences were found across 16 trials between opioids versus nonopioids (most commonly NSAIDs, gabapentinoids, and nortriptyline) in short-term pain, function, health status or quality of life, sleep quality, or mental health outcomes (evidence type 1 for function; evidence type 2 for other outcomes), although opioids were associated with increased risk for shortterm adverse effects (evidence type 1 or 2). Most trials were <6 months; one trial of patients with chronic low back pain or pain associated with osteoarthritis (mean pain intensity: 5.4 on a 0-10 scale at baseline) evaluated outcomes at 1 year (29). The trial found no differences between stepped therapy with opioids versus stepped therapy starting with nonopioids in function, sleep, or mental health outcomes; opioids were associated with slightly worse effects (by approximately 0.5 point on a 0-10 scale) on pain (evidence type 2). Although tramadol was an option in step 3 of the nonopioid stepped therapy arm, only 11% received tramadol; mean opioid doses for stepped opioid therapy and stepped therapy starting with nonopioids were 26 versus 1 MME/day, respectively, at 12 months. Also, there were no differences between combination therapy versus a nonopioid alone in short-term effectiveness but increased risk for short-term adverse effects for combination therapy, on the basis of six trials (evidence type 3). Combination therapy was associated with a small (5-13 MME/day) opioidsparing effect versus opioid therapy alone, with little effect on pain. All trials of combination therapy evaluated patients with neuropathic pain and primarily evaluated gabapentinoids or nortriptyline. Evidence on long-term effects of combination therapy versus an opioid or nonopioid alone was lacking.", "type": "Document"}

One trial included in the 2014 AHRQ report found no differences between a more liberal dosage escalation strategy versus maintenance of current dosages in pain, function, or discontinuation because of opioid misuse; however, the difference in opioid dosages between arms was small (52 versus 40 mg MMD/day) (30) (evidence type 3). No clear differences were found between short-versus longacting opioids (evidence type 3) or between different longacting opioids (evidence type 2) in pain or function; however, in most trials, dosages were titrated to achieve adequate pain control. Evidence on comparative risks of methadone versus other opioids and risk for overdose remains limited and inconsistent. Evidence on the benefits and harms of different methods for initiating and titrating opioids, scheduled and continuous versus as-needed dosing of opioids, use of opioid rotation, and methods for titrating or discontinuing opioids remains insufficient. The 2014 AHRQ report found buccal or intranasal fentanyl more effective than placebo or oral opioids for treatment of exacerbations of chronic pain, based on immediate effects (up to 2 hours after administration). None of the trials of buccal or intranasal fentanyl was designed to assess longer-term benefits or harms, and no new trials were identified for the 2020 systematic review.

Massage, mindfulness-based stress reduction, acupuncture, and multidisciplinary rehabilitation were associated with small short-term improvement in pain versus control (evidence type 2); exercise, low-level laser therapy, and yoga also were associated with small to moderate short-term improvement in pain, although evidence was not as strong (evidence type 3). At intermediate term, spinal manipulation, yoga, multidisciplinary rehabilitation (evidence type 2) and exercise and mindfulness-based stress reduction (evidence type 3) were associated with improved pain versus sham, usual care, or attention control; effects were small for all therapies except for yoga, for which effects were moderate. Compared with exercise, multidisciplinary rehabilitation was associated with small improvements in function and pain at short and intermediate terms (evidence type 2).Chronic Neck Pain. The AHRQ systematic clinical evidence review found low-level laser therapy (evidence type 2) and massage (evidence type 3) associated with improved short-term function and pain for chronic neck pain. The magnitude of effect was moderate for low-level laser therapy and small for massage. Exercise was associated with small improvement in long-term function versus attention control (evidence type 3) and combination exercise was associated with improved shortand long-term function and short-term pain versus waiting list or attention control (evidence type 3). Acupuncture was associated with small improvements in short-and intermediateterm function versus sham, placebo, or usual care; however, there were no differences in pain versus sham acupuncture, an intervention meant to mimic acupuncture but without acupuncture effects (e.g., needles in nonacupuncture point, or nonpenetrating needles or pressure on acupuncture points) (evidence type 3). Pilates was associated with improved shortterm function (small effect) and pain (large effect) versus acetaminophen (evidence type 3).Osteoarthritis Pain. The AHRQ systematic clinical evidence review found that for knee osteoarthritis, exercise was associated with small improvements in short-and long-term function and pain versus usual care, no treatment, or sham (evidence type 2 for short-term and type 3 for long-term) and moderate improvement in intermediate-term pain and function (evidence type 3). For hip osteoarthritis, exercise was associated with small improvement in short-term function and pain versus usual care (evidence type 3). Functional improvement persisted at intermediate-term follow-up but pain improvement did not (evidence type 3).Fibromyalgia. The AHRQ systematic clinical evidence review found exercise, mind-body practices, multidisciplinary rehabilitation, and acupuncture associated with small improvement in short-term function versus usual care or inactive treatments for fibromyalgia (evidence type 2 for acupuncture; evidence type 3 for others). At intermediate term, exercise, acupuncture, cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness-based stress reduction, myofascial release, and multidisciplinary rehabilitation were associated with improvements in function versus inactive treatments, usual care, or waiting list (evidence type 2 for exercise and acupuncture; evidence type 3 for others). Effects on intermediate-term function were moderate for cognitive behavioral therapy and small for the other therapies. At long term, multidisciplinary rehabilitation was associated with persistent small improvement in function versus usual care but not for pain (evidence type 3). Tai chi was associated with small improvement in function versus exercise at short-to intermediate-term follow-up (evidence type 3).

Evidence was somewhat stronger for pharmacologic than nonpharmacologic therapies.For acute surgical dental pain (evidence type 3) and kidney stone pain (evidence type 2), the AHRQ systematic clinical evidence review found that opioids were associated with small to moderate increases in pain or need for rescue medication use versus NSAIDs. Findings for postoperative pain were somewhat inconsistent. Although opioids were associated with increased likelihood of repeat or rescue medication use at 1 day to 1 week (evidence type 3), evidence on pain intensity was insufficient due to inconsistency. Results for postoperative pain were based on a small number of trials and pain related to a limited set of surgical procedures (most commonly cesarean section, anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, knee arthroplasty, and cholecystectomy), limiting generalizability to other surgical procedures. Opioids were associated with increased risk for adverse events such as nausea, dizziness, and sedation versus nonopioid pharmacologic therapies (evidence type 2 or 3). The trials were not designed to assess serious adverse events, and few such events were reported. Evidence on opioids versus acetaminophen was somewhat mixed: for dental pain, the systematic clinical evidence review found opioids were associated with small improvement in pain outcomes on certain measures (evidence type 2) but for kidney stone pain, opioids were associated with a small increase in pain (evidence type 2). Evidence on NSAIDs versus acetaminophen was also somewhat mixed: for dental pain, evidence indicated that NSAIDs were associated with moderate to large decrease in pain (evidence type 2) but for kidney stone pain, evidence was insufficient. Evidence on nonopioid pharmacologic therapies other than NSAIDs or acetaminophen was very limited.Evidence on nonpharmacologic therapies for acute pain was limited. For low back pain, the AHRQ systematic clinical evidence review found that heat therapy was associated with a moderate decrease in pain versus usual care or placebo at 1 day to <1 week and at 2 to <4 weeks (evidence type 2-3). For nonradicular low back pain, there might be no difference between spinal manipulation versus inactive controls (evidence type 2-3), although one trial of patients with radiculopathy found manipulation was associated with increased likelihood of improvement in pain at 2 to <4 weeks and at \u22654 weeks (evidence type 3) Trials of opioid therapy for acute pain were not designed to evaluate effects on long-term use of opioids or outcomes such as misuse or development of opioid use disorder. Limited evidence from observational studies found that being prescribed an opioid for acute low back pain or after minor or elective surgical procedures was associated with increased likelihood of opioid use at longer term (e.g., 6 months or 1 year) follow-up (evidence type 3). Evidence on factors associated with opioid prescribing in patients with acute pain conditions was very limited and suggested that legislation mandating use of PDMP data before prescribing was not associated with decreases in opioid prescribing for low back pain or postoperative pain.

With increasing chances to embed technology in a person's home and provide care remotely, it is imperative that we ensure that diverse older adults have access to telehealth. This statement represents the official policy position of the American Geriatrics Society (AGS), to inform stakeholders about key factors to consider when implementing telehealth. In this position statement, we define telehealth as any method used to provide healthcare remotely by using technology. We outline barriers to providing telehealth to older adults and recommend policies to address those barriers. The AGS positions include recommendations ensuring equitable access to technology, improving digital literacy, addressing physical and cognitive impairments, and enhancing caregiver support, and for tackling reimbursement and regulatory challenges. The AGS recommendations also include attention to the 4Ms put forward by the Age-Friendly Health Systems (AFHS) movement (What Matters, Medication, Mentation, Mobility) with attention to how best to integrate telehealth into the care of older adults with Multicomplexity (the geriatrics fifth M). | IntroductionTelehealth offers an important and growing opportunity to provide convenient and appropriate care to older adults. Over the past few decades, the utilization of telehealth services has grown, with exponential growth during the COVID-19 pandemic when sheltering at home was advised. The number of clinicians and patients participating in telehealth rose sharply in 2020. About 14% of older adults reported that their clinician offered telehealth visits in May 2019, while that number rose to 62% by June 2020 Telehealth is defined as \"the use of electronic information and telecommunication technologies to extend care\" when patients and clinicians are not in the same place at the same time", "type": "Document"}

The numerous advantages of telehealth include reduced no-show and cancellations due to transportation or illness by having access to clinician visits from the convenience of their home Despite the many advantages of telehealth, however, there are also notable disadvantages, including limited ability for a thorough physical examination and hands-on assessment, which may impact diagnosis and the comprehensiveness of care. In addition, older adults face particular barriers in accessing care via telehealth. These barriers include the following: limited access to technology, limited digital literacy, physical and cognitive impairments, lack of caregiver support, reimbursement and regulatory challenges for clinicians providing these services, limited guidance on age-friendly telehealth implementation and practice Telehealth has become an essential component of care, and older adults have indicated a strong desire for telehealth services to remain available", "type": "Document"}

Those with functional impairments who lack caregivers are vulnerable to inadequate telehealth services.For those older adults who do have caregivers, offering caregiver training programs on how to use telehealth modalities can enhance caregivers' ability to support older adults before and during telehealth visits, especially in addressing the issues of limited digital literacy and physical and cognitive impairments. Such training should cover not only technical aspects but also the emotional and logistical support needed for successful telehealth interactions.Caregivers in particular can experience high levels of stress and responsibility, particularly when caring for loved ones with complex health needs, and this can in turn lead to worse patient outcomes. During telehealth visits, clinicians should, when appropriate, directly address caregiver burden, for example by offering access to respite services. Efforts should be made to standardize and expand these programs to ensure that all caregivers have access to the support they need. This includes online resources, support groups, and helplines that can provide guidance and assistance to caregivers regardless of their location Unfortunately, not all older patients have access to caregivers, when they may in fact benefit from one to successfully remain independent in the community. Health systems should educate patients regarding caregiver support options so that those in need can benefit from caregiver assistance, including during telehealth visits.", "type": "Document"}

There are numerous barriers that older adults face as they relate to receiving care via telehealth, and, with increased usage of telehealth since the COVID-19 pandemic began, those barriers threaten to widen disparities between the younger and older population. Each position that AGS outlines in this statement highlights a proactive and necessary approach to addressing those barriers. The dissemination of these practices should involve collaboration among healthcare providers, telehealth experts, and advocacy groups, and policies should be implemented at the government and health system level. By thoroughly tackling these complex issues and implementing the recommended strategies, we can foster a more inclusive, accessible, and agefriendly telehealth system for older adults, ultimately enhancing their access to and delivery of high-quality healthcare services.Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, there has been increasing evidence that telehealth is convenient and effective, and that patients want telehealth services to continue. Telehealth has also proven to be a convenient care delivery method for older adults. It offers numerous benefits, including improved clinical outcomes, patient and caregiver experiences, and logistical and social determinant outcomes. However, as this position statement highlights, the barriers faced by older adults in accessing telehealth, including limited technology access, limited digital literacy, physical and cognitive impairments, lack of caregiver support, reimbursement and regulatory challenges to clinicians providing this care, and the need for age-friendly telehealth implementation, have the potential to widen disparities among older patients.Policies from CMS and other agencies (e.g., FCC) as well as health systems should address these barriers. CMS should reimburse for audio-only telehealth services, telehealth services across state lines, and services performed in post-acute and long-term care settings. CMS and specifically CMMI should also prioritize and support the piloting of telehealth models to improve value-based care. Of critical importance, the FCC must ensure that telehealth is supported in rural and urban communities through broadband internet access. Health systems can address barriers to telehealth by ensuring access to technology and internet connectivity, providing resources for digital literacy, assessing and accommodating physical and cognitive impairments, supporting caregivers, and, for Age-Friendly Health Systems, promoting skills to effectively deliver Geriatric 5Ms care via telehealth. The need to make telehealth equitable and accessible to older adults is urgent, the opportunity for improved access to care, reduced healthcare costs, and better patient outcomes is significant. Ensuring age-friendly telehealth practices relies on continued federal reimbursement for diverse telehealth modalities and team member roles, licensure across state lines for the care continuum, and global dissemination of best practices. AGS recommends that future research be inclusive of diverse older adults to expand knowledge on age-friendly telehealth services.\n", "type": "Document"}

Unlike the earlier list of alternatives While providing alternative therapies for common conditions in older adults may seem to be a straightforward process, a number of challenges are worth noting. Potentially inappropriate medications may often be prescribed on the basis of symptoms rather than diagnoses, such as when a medication is used to treat the symptoms of insomnia, anxiety, rhinorrhea, or pain without having a confirmed diagnosis of the underlying disease process In light of these challenges, the panel aimed to take a commonsense approach that was guided by evidence, existing clinical practice guidelines, and other best-practice documents to craft practical, clinically sensible alternatives that are feasible for clinicians to review and use in busy clinical practice environments. As part of this, the panel attempted to highlight when evidence was limited or unavailable, including in clinical scenarios where prescribing practice often diverges from available evidence, such as medication choices for the management of insomnia. When especially important, the alternatives also include reminders for clinicians to seek out and target management to the underlying cause of symptoms-for example, symptoms of rhinorrhea, insomnia, or involuntary weight loss-rather than just treating the symptom without further investigation.Moreover, it is important to remember that the solution for stopping a potentially inappropriate medication is not just to start a \"better\" medication in its place. Thus, when appropriate, the panel emphasized the role of non-pharmacologic strategies to help manage the listed conditions. In addition, stopping a potentially inappropriate medication is not the end goal, especially if doing so may worsen symptoms or result in goal-discordant care.It is equally important to find safer non-pharmacologic and/or pharmacologic management strategies that help the patient feel better while reducing the risk of medication-associated harms.Users of this list should keep several things in mind. The list is intended as brief, practical guidance that is most applicable to ambulatory care settings (although not exclusively so). It is not comprehensive; it should not substitute for clinical judgment or for individualized, patient-centered care; and it is intended to complement rather than replace other forms of clinical support such as clinical practice guidelines or best-practice monographs. Alternatives for each condition were based on a review of a limited number of guidelines or other best practice documents, further informed by the expertise of the panelists, and the panelists did not review primary research literature or all available guidelines.Additional considerations also merit attention. With limited exceptions, the list does not denote which medications are approved by the FDA for which conditions. Readers considering the use of agents not subject to FDA oversight (e.g., dietary supplements, nutraceuticals, herbal products) should remember that the contents, dose, and purity of these agents cannot be guaranteed. When medications available over-the-counter are recommended, it is important to keep in mind that the dose of the active agent(s) and presence of other medications may vary by product, so attention to product formulation and product-specific instructions is important. Finally, but not least, medications on the AGS Beers Criteria\u00ae are potentially inappropriate for most older adults, not definitely inappropriate for all Clinical practice is difficult, and clinicians need guidance not only on what not to do, but also on what to do instead. This list of alternative non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic management strategies that can be used instead of AGS Beers Criteria\u00ae medications to treat common conditions in older adults is intended to provide clinicians an easy-to-use resource for improving care. It is a starting point, and the panel encourages readers to peruse the resources provided and to review practice guidelines, best-practice monographs, and other guidance in service of developing optimal management plans for the older adults under their care.\n", "type": "Document"}

Elevated LDL-cholesterol and non-HDLcholesterol levels remain predictive of incident atherosclerotic cardiovascular events among individuals older than 75 years. Risk prediction among older individuals is less certain because most current risk calculators lack specificity in those older than 75 years and do not adjust for co-morbidities, functional status, frailty, and cognition which significantly impact prognosis in this age group. Data on the benefits and risks of lowering LDL-cholesterol with statins in older patients without atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease are also limited since most primary prevention trials have included mostly younger patients. Available data suggest that statin therapy in older primary prevention patients may reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular events and that benefits from lipid-lowering with statins outweigh potential risks such as statin-associated muscle symptoms and incident Type 2 diabetes mellitus. While some evidence suggests the possibility that statins may be associated with incident cognitive impairment in older adults, a preponderance of literature indicates neutral or even protective statin-related cognitive effects. Shared decisionmaking which is recommended for all patients when considering statin therapy is particularly important in older patients. Randomized clinical trial data evaluating the use of non-statin lipid-lowering therapy in older patients are sparse. Deprescribing", "type": "Document"}

The topics of ICU delirium and ICU sedation in the critical care environment (eg, mechanically ventilated patients) has been recently covered in a separate guideline statement, and were not intended to be covered in the present guideline. 24 Topics considered by the panel, for which there was not enough evidence to make a recommendation statement, were: administration of general anesthesia versus neuroaxial anesthesia to prevent delirium, [25][26] choice of one anesthetic agent over another agent, 25 choice of specific anesthetic agents, 25 use of neuroaxial anesthesia postoperatively to prevent delirium, 25 single-component nonpharmacologic prevention and treatment of delirium, 22 and prescription of melatonin to prevent delirium. 27ET,28ET It is important to note that many of the studies used to formulate some of the recommendations are in nonsurgical patients, a fact that makes extrapolating the findings to surgical patients less ideal in comparison to studies performed in surgical patients since the etiology of delirium in nonsurgical patients may be different.

Current evidence most strongly associates use of anticholinergic drugs, meperidine and benzodiazepines with increased postoperative delirium. Agostini et al 112ET performed a prospective cohort study of hospitalized medical patients examining the effect of diphenhydramine on delirium and found that diphenhydramine was associated with delirium (OR 2.3; 95% CI 1.4-3.6). Marcantonio et al 2ET performed a nested case control study in patients 50 years and older after major elective noncardiac surgery and found a significant association between meperidine use and delirium (OR 2.7; CI 1.3-5.5).

Drugs that contribute to serotonin syndrome (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, linezolid, tramadol, and amphetamines) can lead to delirium.

First, the recommendations were limited by the available evidence, which was often not extensive and frequently of low quality. Second, the search strategies may have missed some studies, and importantly, studies published in languages other than English were excluded. Third, many of the studies were not specific to the postoperative setting, and the panel applied their findings to the surgical setting. In spite of the origins of the evidence, however, because the expert panel focused on applying the findings to the peri-and postoperative setting, thus the specific recommendations must be extrapolated with caution to other settings. Particularly, our systematic review of the literature excluded studies related to sedation in the ICU, and studies related to palliative care and nursing home care settings. In all cases, these guidelines are not intended to supersede clinical judgment or individual patient choices or values. Ultimately, clinical decision-making must always be customized to the individual situation. Despite these limitations, this guideline has many strengths. We used an evidence-based approach guided by IOM standards for the systematic review and guideline development. All of the evidence underwent rigorous review for quality and risk of bias through a carefully standardized process. The guideline panel, which included broad and appropriate interdisciplinary expertise relevant to the recommendations, carefully considered the evidence and achieved full consensus. Additionally, the guideline panel was supported by quality measure experts who helped guide the language used in the recommendation statements to be optimal for translation into clinical quality measures. The guideline has been revised based on peer review and public commentary, including extensive input from the target audience of healthcare professionals, as well as from lay audiences, family caregivers, and senior advocacy organizations.

The year-on-year reduction in general mortality has been reversed in the USA with opioid misuse being a major component of the increase in mortality Opioids are used widely intraoperatively and, used safely and appropriately, still play an important role in postoperative analgesia. Nonetheless, the post-surgical use of opioids is thought to be an important source of problems. Although we cannot quantify this problem in the UK, concern expressed by individuals and UK publications indicate that the perioperative period is an important source of new persistent opioid use and this cannot be ignored We have a duty to act to minimise the role that anaesthesia, surgery and primary care may have in contributing to the \"opioid load\" in the community in the UK. It is imperative that all healthcare professionals involved in surgery and perioperative care work collaboratively to ensure robust opioid stewardship Nearly 4 million surgical procedures are performed annually in the UK In principle, while ensuring the perioperative plan is drawn up in collaboration with the patient and reflects their choices and involvement in their surgical journey, all involved health practitioners have the following duties:1. To ensure that opioids started in the perioperative period are not continued unnecessarily.Recent data from the USA reports that approximately 6% of surgical patients (versus 0.4% of the non-surgical cohort) persistently use opioids 90-180 days after surgery (both major and minor) 2. To ensure that patients taking opioids are identified before surgery 3. To identify risk factors for opioid misuse disorder (e.g. anxiety, depression", "type": "Document"}

This includes ensuring that a proper handover of pain management plan to ward /High Dependency Unit (HDU)/Intensive Care Unit (ICU) nurses is performed and signposting staff who could be called for resolving pain management issues if required.2. Functional pain assessment: For patients with complex pain problems, an elevated pain intensity taken in isolation should not be a sole indicator for the administration of further opioids and should not hinder discharge to the ward. A pain assessment that involves functional assessment (i.e pain on breathing or movement) along with awareness of factors such as anxiety that can increase pain perception is recommended.3. Immediate-release opioids are preferred in the management of postoperative pain (to decrease risk of respiratory impairment and long term continuation), when simple analgesics such as paracetamol or NSAIDs are not effective enough to allow the achievement of agreed functional goals.4. Advice on medicine self administration: On discharge, patients must be advised how to selfadminister medicines safely, wean analgesics, dispose of unused analgesic medications and of the dangers of driving/operating machinery while taking opioid medicines. The dangers of mixing opioids with alcohol and other illicit drugs that increase risk of harm should be communicated. A patient leaflet should be provided to reinforce these messages.", "type": "Document"}

Identification of patients for de-escalation of opioids: Some painful conditions, such as osteoarthritis of the knee, may require surgical procedures to treat pain and improve function. Patients with these conditions may be taking opioid medications before surgery. These opioids should be gradually withdrawn, where possible, after surgery.8.

Preoperative assessment: a. Preoperative assessment for complex pain patients with pain should include an assessment of pain and current consumption of analgesic drugs including opioids.Ideally, it should focus on a biopsychosocial assessment of pain as outlined in the FPM guidelines for assessment of pain 2. Prehabilitation: a. Consideration should be given to reducing preoperative anxiety and catastrophising, b. Preoperative counselling should include working collaboratively with the patient and expectation management regarding opioid use and perioperative pain management c. Patients with complex pain needs who may benefit from an extended stay in the post anaesthesia care unit (PACU) should be identified, so that appropriate plans can be formulated.3. Complex pain cases: (Additional preoperative recommendations for opioid tolerant patients) a. For complex pain patients on high dose opioids, the opinion of a pain specialist b. A useful way to assess preoperative opioid consumption is through the calculation of the Oral Morphine Equivalent dose (OME) Surgery and Opioids Best Practice Guidelines 2021 c. Opioid tolerance (decrease in pharmacological response) and opioid induced hyperalgesia (increase in pain perception) may occur in patients taking opioids. Opioid tolerance is likely at 60 mg of OME for \u22657 days d. If the enteral route is unavailable immediately after surgery, opioid conversion should be made to parenteral morphine.e. Prehabilitation (optimisation before surgery) should include optimal management of preoperative pain and optimisation of opioids and other pain/adjuvant medications. In selected cases, weaning of opioids should be considered before surgery f. In patients unsuitable for preoperative opioid de-escalation, opioids taken before surgery should usually be continued throughout the surgical admission.g.

These guidelines create a template for staffing, equipment, education, policies and procedures, follow-up care, and performance improvement measures. When implemented collectively, a geriatric ED can expect to see improvements in patient care, customer service, and staff satisfaction. A goal of the geriatric ED is to recognize those patients who will benefit from inpatient care, and to effectively implement outpatient care to those who do not require inpatient resources. To implement most effectively, the geriatric ED will utilize the resources of the hospital, ED and inpatient, as well as outpatient resources. Making effective and expedient outpatient arrangements available to the geriatric population is of critical importance to the care of this population, recognizing that acute inpatient events are often accompanied by functional decline, increased dependency and increased morbidity. The benefits of the Geriatric ED to the geriatric patient population are multiple and clear. By focusing attention and resources on the most common needs of the geriatric ED patient, care can be optimized. The benefit of a Geriatric ED to a hosting hospital can be multiple as well. These improved patient care standards can become a significant marketing tool for hospitals looking to reach out to the Medicare population and partner with extended care facilities. A Geriatric ED can market the ED to attract a patient population that may also utilize higher reimbursing hospital-based programs, including cardiac, orthopedic, and neurologic care. Further, with Medicare reimbursements decreasing and payment for iatrogenic complications such as wounds, catheter associated infections, etc. impacting hospital reimbursement; the need for special attention to geriatric needs has become even more pressing.The term \"geriatric\" has had different definitions over the past decades. In 1985, the term \"oldest old\" was coined to identify those 85 years of age and older. Later Fries, et al defined three groups by dividing the older adult population into the young old (often 65-74), the middle old (75-85) and the oldest old (>85). The recommendations found in this packet represent research and consensus-based best practices from the perspectives of the American College of Emergency Physicians, Society for Academic Emergency Medicine, American Geriatrics Society, and Emergency Nurses Association. With implementation of the following recommendations, hospitals, regardless of size, will positively impact the care of the geriatric emergency patients.", "type": "Document"}

Challenges involving mobility, incontinence, behavioral needs, etc. are best met with equipment designed for the effective and comfortable evaluation and treatment of geriatric patients, while minimizing iatrogenic complications. The physical plant of a Geriatric ED should focus on structural modifications that promote improvements in safety, comfort, mobility, memory cues, and sensorial perception both with vision and hearing for elders in the ED. Common key features are those that enhance lighting, colors, enhanced signage -all of these are better, not only for older adults, but for everyone. Although a separate space within an ED, or a separate ED entirely, devoted to geriatrics may be beneficial, most hospitals will be more capable of effectively implementing a program in which any ED bed can be made \"geriatric friendly\" with the presence of the equipment and supplies listed.The list below is a suggested starting point for the design and equipping of a Geriatric ED. \u2022 Exam chairs/reclining chairs -may be more comfortable for some geriatric patients and facilitate transfer processes. \u2022 Extra thick/soft gurney mattress -decreases possible development of skin break down and decubitus ulcer formation. \u2022 Economic evidence supports early prevention of pressure ulcers in ED patients by the use of pressureredistributing foam mattresses. \u2022 Body warming devices/warm blankets \u2022 Fluid warmer\u2022 Non-slip fall mats \u2022 Walking aids/devices \u2022 Respiratory equipment to include a fiberoptic intubation device\u2022 Restraint devices\u2022 Urinary catheters to include condom catheters -minimize risk of CAUTI\u2022 Visual Orientation improvements:\u2022 Lighting -soft light is recommended, but exposure to natural light is also shown to be beneficial for recovery times and decreasing delirium\u2022 Light colored walls with a matte sheen and light flooring with a low-glare finish should be used to optimize lighting and reduce glare. While older adults require three to four times as much light as young adults for visual clarity, light scatter also increases with aging eyes.Simply increasing the level of lighting can improve acuity, and it is recommended that lighting consist of a combination of ambient and spot lighting. In contrast, glare and shine along with difficulty seeing the edges of pale colored objects have been shown to be impediments for older adults in their ability to function and confusing for those with cognitive impairments. Thus, improvements that increase lighting while reducing glare can include shielding of illuminating fixtures above the upper visual field. Fixtures that bounce light off the ceiling or of walls increase overall room lighting while glare can be reduced with the use of matte surfaces. Uniform indirect light.\u2022 Patients should have control of the lighting in their space if they wish to sleep at a time when the other lights are on, allowing for fewer sleep disturbances.\u2022 PATTERNS\u2022 Contrast sensitivity in aging vision can be both confusing and hinder movement in geriatric patients, especially with reduced depth perception. Patterns that have dominant contrasts may create a sense of vertigo or even seem to vibrate for older adults. Others may misperceive patterns as obstacles or objects (eg, leaf patterns on flooring may be seen as real live leaves to avoid when walking).\u2022 COLORS\u2022 Secondary to vision and perception changes, color choice for facilities and structure should be considered. Color can be used to enhance visual function and depth perception. Avoid monochromatic color schemes and allow for colors to contrast between horizontal and vertical surfaces. Similar colors look the same for those with poor vision. Older adults experience a decrease in the ability to differentiate cool colors (greens, blues) as opposed to warm colors (yellows, oranges). In poorly lit areas, yellow is the most visible. Orange and reds are attention grabbing. Blues appear hazy and indistinct and may appear gray due to yellowing of the lens.\u2022 Acoustic Orientation Improvements -private rooms or acoustically enhanced drapes, if necessary, for better communication and decrease levels of anxiety and delirium\u2022 An enhanced acoustical environment may facilitate communication between patients and staff and between staff. While older adults may have decreased ability to hear certain words secondary to a loss of hearing in high-frequency ranges, they also have increased sensitivity to loud sounds.

In addition to understanding the specific needs of the patient population, adapting to resource limitations, it is also important that there is commitment to improving geriatric care from senior administration. There are several models of transitional care that are designed to address the pitfalls of care transitions. 190,191 mmon components of these models, drawn from the literature and various resources, including AHRQ and the Institute for Health care Improvement's State Action on Avoidable Rehospitalizations State Action on Avoidable Rehospitalization (STAAR) initiative, are outlined below. See Appendix IX for a list of well-known models of transitional care. The health care team should assess the patient's social support and need for home health prior to discharge. Where appropriate, the family and caregivers should be involved with discharge planning. a. Patient or patient caregiver should be given a complete list of all medications and dosages to continue upon discharge from the hospital. Medication changes made during the hospital stay should be emphasized 2. A discussion with the patient or patient caregiver should be held and documented with a health care professional regarding the purpose of each drug, how it is to be taken, and the expected side effects and adverse reactions of new medications. 3. Patients should undergo assessments of the following prior to discharge, and an appropriate follow-up plan should be initiated: a. Nutrition (Mini Nutritional Assessment) b. Cognition (3-Item Recall or Mini Mental State Exam) c. Ambulation ability (Timed Up and Go Test) d. Functional status e. Presence of delirium 4. If an elderly patient undergoes elective or nonelective inpatient surgery and is being discharged from a hospital to home or to a nursing home, then written discharge instructions should be given and the following should be performed: a. Comprehension of verbal discharge instructions should be assessed by checking ability of patient or caretaker to repeat back to the health care provider the discharge instructions b. Documentation of pending laboratory tests or diagnostic studies, if applicable c. Documentation of follow-up appointment for nonsurgeon physician visits or medical treatments, if applicable d. Documentation of follow-up appointment with the surgeon or telephone contact with the surgeon within two to four weeks of discharge 5.

Specifically, many people of various ethnicities use complementary and integrative modalities of care, including indigenous healing therapies and techniques. Ask yourself what stigmas are associated with the sociocultural group you most closely identify with? How has the group you grew up and live in influenced the dominant values you now hold? How do your perceptions differ from those of people who come from other cultural backgrounds? What is your attitude toward older adults who are from a lower socioeconomic status, have limited English proficiency or minimal health literacy, who are immigrants with an accent or are difficult to understand? How do you respond to a patient who requires an interpreter?In addition to the providers' personal biases, language can be a barrier. When caring for any older adult of a different ethnicity, as a first step, a clinician should gauge the patient's English proficiency and health literacy and make arrangements to facilitate the support needed to optimize the clinical encounter.Finally, some minority groups may be mistrustful because of past abuses at the interpersonal and systemic level. Among the remedial strategies are honest self-reflection by providers, use of interpreters to facilitate communication, provision of information at an appropriate level of clarity, eliciting and incorporating input from older adults in decision-making, and involvement of community leaders to rebuild trust. As we work within interprofessional teams, in a variety of settings and diverse facilities such as acute care, ambulatory care, assisted living facilities, nursing homes, and home health, it is important for the healthcare team to acknowledge and recognize the individual's and team's biases and beliefs and how these may affect the care of older adults.", "type": "Document"}

Potential interventions to overcome mistrust by minority populations require investigators to improve communication and share information with minorities about clinical research in a way that facilitates informed decision-making. Potential study participants should be informed about prior successful interventions that have improved outcomes for minorities (e.g., hypertension). In addition, investigators or team members should be available to answer questions or concerns of minorities. Investigators may choose to seek minority physician referrals to build on the trust already forged in physician-patient relationships. By focusing efforts on specific communities, investigators may raise awareness of targeted healthcare conditions and the critical role clinical research plays in advancing health care.

Prevention recommendations focused on primary prevention (i.e., preventing delirium before it occurs) in patients who are at risk for postoperative delirium (e.g., those identified as moderate-to-high risk based on previous risk stratification models such as the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines, Delirium: Diagnosis, Prevention and Management. Clinical Guideline 103; London (UK): 2010 July 29). For management of delirium, the goals of this guideline are to decrease delirium severity and duration, ensure patient safety and improve outcomes.

A recent survey of surgical specialists carried out by the American Geriatrics Society Geriatrics-for-Specialists Initiative (AGS-GSI) identified delirium as the most \"essential\" topic in the care of older adults, and as the least understood geriatric clinical issue for which the knowledge gap for optimal management was greatest. The abstracted set of recommendations presented here provides essential guidance both on the prevention of postoperative delirium in older patients at risk of delirium and on the treatment of older surgical patients with delirium, and is based on the 2014 AGS Guideline. The full version of the guideline, American Geriatrics Society Clinical Practice Guideline for Postoperative Deliriumin in Older Adults is available at www.GeriatricsCareOnline.org. The overall aims of the study were twofold: first, to present nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic interventions that should be implemented perioperatively for the prevention of postoperative delirium; and second, to present nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic interventions that should be implemented perioperatively for the treatment of postoperative delirium. Prevention recommendations focused on primary prevention (i.e., preventing delirium before it occurs) in patients who are at risk for postoperative delirium (e.g., those identified as moderate-to-high risk based on previous risk stratification models such as the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines). The guideline is limited to the aims described. Some of these recommendations will not apply to specific areas of care, such as intensive care unit (ICU) sedation, palliative care, and nursing home settings. Diagnosis and screening are not addressed in these guidelines. Other topics, such as prescription of melatonin to prevent delirium, were considered but not addressed due to a lack of evidence. 9ET,10ET Since delirium is a burgeoning area of clinical investigation, regular updates of the recommendations are planned as new evidence becomes available.", "type": "Document"}

The recommendation statements provide a framework to allow hospital systems and healthcare professionals to implement actionable, evidence-based measures to improve delirium prevention and treatment. These guidelines have some important limitations including feasibility restrictions in completeness of the literature search, limited quality of available evidence, and extrapolation from studies conducted outside the surgical setting. Importantly, this guideline is not intended to supersede clinical judgment or individual patient preferences, and decisions must always be customized to the individual situation. Despite the limitations, the guideline follows a rigorous evidence-based approach guided by IOM standards for systematic review and guideline development, conducted by an interdisciplinary expert panel, and revised extensively based on commentary from stakeholders and the public. Ultimately, it is hoped that this guideline will help to improve clinical care, advance policy, and lay the groundwork for future discoveries in this important area to improve quality of life for older adults and their families.\n", "type": "Document"}
