PMC11282474.txt,"## TARGET POPULATION (extracted from the guideline text)

### Primary target population (explicitly stated)
**Patients who need or had noncardiac surgery** (adult surgical patients in the perioperative setting).

**Verbatim evidence from the guideline:**
- “**Our panel did not include lay members or patient representatives of the target population (i.e. patients who need or had noncardiac surgery).**”
- “**In adults having noncardiac surgery**, intraoperative mean arterial pressures <60–70 mm Hg or systolic arterial pressures <90–100 mm Hg are associated with…”
- The abstract and conclusions repeatedly frame the recommendations around **perioperative arterial pressure management** in **patients having surgery**, and specifically **noncardiac surgery**.

### Subgroups / segmented “target populations” implied by the recommendations (with significant details)

#### 1) “At-risk” noncardiac surgical patients (intraoperative BP target applies specifically here)
**Who they are (as described in the guideline):**
- Noncardiac surgery patients considered **at-risk** for harm from hypotension (the document does not provide a strict list, but it repeatedly links risk to organ injury outcomes and mentions high-risk contexts such as complex operations and significant comorbidities).

**Key recommendation tied to this population:**
- “**We recommend keeping intraoperative mean arterial pressure ≥60 mm Hg in at-risk patients**…”

**Contextual details used to define/recognize this group in the text:**
- Discussion references patients with **high baseline cardiovascular risk** (example trial population).
- Mentions “**high-risk patients with significant comorbidities**” in the context of who often receives continuous arterial pressure monitoring (arterial catheter).

#### 2) Noncardiac surgical patients with elevated venous or compartment pressures (special MAP targeting)
**Who they are:**
- Surgical patients in whom **venous outflow pressure** or **extravascular/compartment pressure** is elevated (examples given: **central venous pressure**, **intraabdominal pressure**, **intracranial pressure**).

**Key recommendation tied to this population:**
- “**We recommend increasing mean arterial pressure targets when venous or compartment pressures are elevated**…”

**Significant details:**
- The guideline explains the rationale in terms of **organ perfusion pressure** and suggests a practical adjustment:
  - If desired organ perfusion pressure is 65 mm Hg and compartment pressure is 15 mm Hg, then MAP might be maintained **>80 mm Hg**.

#### 3) Noncardiac surgical patients undergoing complex operations / with significant comorbidities (monitoring-focused population)
**Who they are:**
- Patients having **complex operations** and/or **high-risk patients with significant comorbidities**, for whom clinicians may use **arterial catheters** and continuous monitoring.

**Key statement tied to this population:**
- “**Continuous intraoperative arterial pressure monitoring helps clinicians reduce the severity and duration of hypotension compared to intermittent**…”

**Significant details:**
- Continuous monitoring is positioned as particularly relevant where hemodynamic fluctuations are expected and where missing hypotension is more consequential.

#### 4) Postoperative (ward/PACU) noncardiac surgical patients at risk of unrecognized hypotension
**Who they are:**
- Patients **after surgery**, especially on the ward where hypotension may be **prolonged and untreated**.

**Key statement tied to this population:**
- “**Postoperative hypotension is often unrecognised and might be more important than intraoperative hypotension because it is often prolonged**…”

**Significant details:**
- Causes listed for postoperative hypotension include: antihypertensive medications, inadequate IV fluids, anesthetic drug effects, blood loss, inflammatory response, arrhythmias, impaired myocardial function.
- Notes typical hospital alert thresholds (example): systolic arterial pressure **<90 mm Hg**.
- Highlights associations with **AKI, cardiovascular events, readmission, mortality**.

---

## Scope boundary (what is explicitly in-scope / out-of-scope)
- **In-scope:** **Adults having noncardiac surgery** (perioperative period: intraoperative and postoperative).
- **Not clearly addressed / not specified:** pediatric patients; cardiac surgery patients (the document repeatedly specifies **noncardiac surgery**).",periop,target_population_extraction
PMC11282474.txt,"This POQI consensus statement is **not written as a “use/don’t use” bedside protocol with formal exclusion criteria** the way a clinical trial or a drug label would be. It is a set of **general recommendations** about perioperative arterial pressure monitoring/targets, and clinicians are expected to individualise.

That said, the document **does define its intended population**, and you can infer the main groups in whom it **does not apply or should not be applied without major modification**:

## 1) Patients outside the stated target population
### a) **Cardiac surgery**
- The conclusions explicitly refer to **“adults having noncardiac surgery.”**
- Cardiac surgery (e.g., CABG, valve surgery) has different physiology (cardiopulmonary bypass, different perfusion strategies, different evidence base), so these targets/monitoring statements should not be treated as directly applicable.

### b) **Children**
- The statement is framed around **adult** thresholds (e.g., MAP ≥60 mmHg) and adult outcome data (AKI, myocardial injury).
- Paediatric blood pressure norms and autoregulation thresholds differ substantially.

### c) **Non-operative/ICU shock resuscitation contexts**
- Although concepts overlap, this is a **perioperative** guideline (intraoperative + postoperative ward/PACU). It is not intended to replace sepsis/shock guidelines or ICU vasopressor protocols.

## 2) Situations where a single MAP threshold (e.g., ≥60 mmHg) is not appropriate
Even within noncardiac adult surgery, the paper repeatedly signals that **one-size-fits-all thresholds are uncertain** and that targets should be adjusted. In practice, these are “functional exclusions” from using the guideline *as written* (i.e., using MAP ≥60 as the main target without adjustment):

### a) **Elevated venous or compartment pressures (reduced perfusion pressure)**
The guideline itself says to **increase MAP targets** when outflow/compartment pressures are high, because organ perfusion pressure is roughly:
- **Perfusion pressure ≈ MAP − venous/compartment pressure**

Examples where MAP ≥60 may be inadequate unless adjusted upward:
- **Intra-abdominal hypertension/abdominal compartment syndrome**
- **Raised intracranial pressure**
- Markedly **elevated central venous pressure** (e.g., severe right heart failure, tamponade physiology, high PEEP with impaired venous return)

### b) **Patients needing higher pressures for organ-specific reasons**
The statement highlights uncertainty about individual harm thresholds and autoregulation. Groups commonly requiring higher targets (not “excluded,” but you should not apply the simple threshold uncritically) include:
- **Chronic hypertension** (right-shifted autoregulation in some patients)
- Significant **cerebrovascular disease** (e.g., carotid stenosis) where cerebral perfusion may be pressure-dependent
- Some **renal vascular disease** or advanced CKD where renal perfusion may be more vulnerable

## 3) Cases where “treat hypotension based on presumed cause” requires different algorithms
The recommendation to treat hypotension based on vasodilation/hypovolaemia/bradycardia/low CO is broadly applicable, but in some settings the differential diagnosis and treatment priorities are different enough that this consensus statement is not sufficient as a stand-alone guide, for example:
- **Major haemorrhage protocols** (damage control resuscitation, permissive hypotension in selected trauma before haemostasis—context dependent and not addressed here)
- **Obstetric anaesthesia** (different physiology and evidence base; not addressed)
- **Pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma surgery** or other highly specialised endocrine cases (BP management is unique)

## 4) Measurement/monitoring caveats (not patient exclusions, but “don’t apply blindly”)
The paper notes that oscillometric cuffs can misestimate extremes (overestimate low BP, underestimate high BP). So in patients where accurate beat-to-beat BP is critical, relying on intermittent cuff readings may make the guideline’s numeric thresholds unreliable unless you use:
- **Invasive arterial line**, or
- Validated **continuous noninvasive** monitoring

## Bottom line
**Hard exclusion criteria explicitly stated:** essentially **anyone who is not an adult undergoing noncardiac surgery** (notably **cardiac surgery** and **paediatrics**).

**Practical “do not use as-is” groups:** patients with **elevated venous/compartment pressures** or conditions where **higher, individualised MAP targets** are needed; and specialised contexts (massive haemorrhage/trauma strategies, obstetrics, etc.) that the statement does not address.

If you tell me the **surgery type** and the patient’s key comorbidities (e.g., chronic HTN, CKD, carotid disease, heart failure, raised ICP/IAP), I can map which parts of the POQI recommendations are likely applicable and which would need adjustment.",periop,exclusion_criteria_extraction
PMC11289045.txt,"## TARGET POPULATION (extracted from the guideline text)

### Overall / Guideline-wide target population
**Older adults (defined as age ≥65 years) undergoing major abdominal surgery**, where “major abdominal surgery” in this guideline includes:
- **Colorectal surgery**
- **Upper gastrointestinal (Upper GI) surgery**
- **Hepatopancreaticobiliary (HPB) surgery**
- **Hernia surgery**

This scope is stated in multiple places, including:
- **Abstract (Aim):** “perioperative care of older adults undergoing major abdominal surgery.”
- **Results:** “Older adults were defined as 65 years and older.”
- **Methods > Inclusion and exclusion criteria:** “Clinical studies in older adults (over 65 years) undergoing major abdominal surgery, defined as upper or lower gastrointestinal, hepatobiliary, or hernia…”

**Key perioperative optimization topics applied to this population:**
- **Prehabilitation / preoperative optimization**
- **Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) vs open**
- **Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) vs conventional care**

**Explicit exclusions (study selection level):**
- **Children (<18 years)** were excluded from included evidence (not the clinical target, but an explicit exclusion criterion in the guideline’s evidence base).
- **Non-English publications**, animal studies, narrative reviews/editorials/commentaries were excluded from evidence synthesis.

---

## Segmented target populations (by surgical subgroup used throughout the guideline)

### 1) Older adults undergoing **colorectal surgery**
**Target population text (substance):**
- Elderly/older adult patients (≥65) **undergoing colorectal surgery** (the guideline does not restrict to malignant vs benign colorectal disease).

**Important details/clarifications from the guideline:**
- In MIS section (KQ17), the panel considered **colorectal disease “as a whole,” without distinguishing malignant vs benign** or specific lower-GI location.
- Recommendations and outcomes focus on short-term perioperative endpoints (e.g., **30-day complications, length of stay, 30-day readmission**), and the guideline also highlights **delirium** as an important outcome to report in older adults.

---

### 2) Older adults undergoing **Upper GI surgery**
**Target population text (substance):**
- Elderly/older adult patients (≥65) **undergoing Upper GI surgery**.

**Important details/clarifications from the guideline:**
- The Upper GI evidence base in included studies was **predominantly gastric rather than esophageal**.
- The panel **excluded bariatric-related gastric resection** from this guideline’s scope (not treated as part of the target surgical population for Upper GI in this document).

---

### 3) Older adults undergoing **HPB surgery (hepatopancreaticobiliary)**
**Target population text (substance):**
- Elderly/older adult patients (≥65) **undergoing HPB surgery**.

**Important details/clarifications from the guideline:**
- For MIS in HPB (KQ19), the panel treated **HPB pathologies without distinction by etiology or localization**, largely because the eligible literature was limited.
- The guideline notes that much of the included HPB MIS literature involved **benign cholecystitis/cholecystectomy**, and it calls for more evidence beyond that.

---

### 4) Older adults undergoing **hernia surgery**
**Target population text (substance):**
- Elderly/older adult patients (≥65) **undergoing hernia surgery**.

**Important details/clarifications from the guideline:**
- Hernia surgery was considered **overall**, “irrespective of the localization of the defect” and **primary vs recurrent** abdominal wall repair.
- For ERAS in hernia surgery (KQ24), the panel found **no eligible evidence** meeting criteria; discussion mentions that some hernia operations (e.g., **Nissen/paraesophageal hernia**) already have low LOS, and that **esophagectomy** has limited poor-quality elderly data (noting heterogeneity in “hernia/upper GI” contexts).

---

## Cross-cutting “target population” qualifiers used throughout
These apply across the above surgical subgroups unless otherwise specified:

- **Age definition:** “Older adults” = **65 years and older**.
- **Setting/phase:** **Perioperative** care (preoperative optimization/prehabilitation, intraoperative approach via MIS vs open, and postoperative optimization via ERAS).
- **Core outcomes emphasized for older adults:** **delirium, postoperative complications, length of stay (LOS), readmission**.
- **Alcohol/smoking cessation definition used for older adults in this perioperative context:** **no alcohol-containing beverage or nicotine-containing product for 4 weeks prior to surgery** (presented as a standardized definition for reporting/application).

If you upload the PDF (or images) of the guideline pages, I can also extract the *exact* “Target population” wording verbatim (if it exists as a labeled section) and provide page/line citations.",periop,target_population_extraction
PMC11289045.txt,"This EAES/SAGES document is **not written as a “who should/shouldn’t receive care” clinical protocol with patient-level contraindications**. It is a consensus guideline about **perioperative optimization strategies** (prehabilitation, MIS, ERAS) in a defined population. So the “exclusion criteria” are best understood as **(A) who is outside the guideline’s intended scope** and **(B) situations where the guideline itself says decisions must be individualized rather than automatically applied**.

## A) Patients outside the intended scope (i.e., the guideline does not apply)

### 1) Age outside the target population
- **Not intended for patients < 65 years old.**
  - The guideline defines “older adults” as **≥ 65**.

### 2) Not undergoing the types of operations covered
The guideline is limited to **major abdominal surgery** in these categories:
- **Colorectal**
- **Upper GI** (primarily gastric/esophageal-type operations; see bariatric exclusion below)
- **Hepatopancreaticobiliary (HPB)**
- **Hernia surgery**

So it is **not intended** for patients undergoing:
- Non-abdominal surgery (orthopedic, cardiac, vascular outside abdominal context, neurosurgery, etc.)
- Minor procedures not reasonably considered “major abdominal surgery”
- Abdominal operations outside those categories (e.g., many gynecologic/urologic operations are not addressed)

### 3) Bariatric surgery patients (explicitly excluded)
- The panel explicitly states they **did not include bariatric-related gastric resection** in this guideline because it was addressed elsewhere.

### 4) Pediatric patients
- **Children/adolescents (<18 years)** are outside scope (explicitly excluded in the evidence review).

### 5) Contexts not addressed by the evidence base used
This is not a “patient exclusion,” but it limits applicability:
- The evidence base was restricted to **English-language** publications (so generalizability to settings only represented in non-English literature may be reduced).

## B) Patients for whom the guideline should not be applied “automatically” (requires case-by-case judgment)

Even within scope (≥65 and having one of the covered operations), the document repeatedly emphasizes that recommendations—especially MIS vs open and ERAS implementation—must be **individualized**. That means there are patient groups where you **cannot use the guideline as a blanket rule**:

### 1) Patients who are not candidates for MIS for clinical/anatomic/physiologic reasons
The guideline recommends MIS in older adults overall, but it also notes concerns that are particularly relevant in older patients:
- **Significant cardiopulmonary comorbidity** where pneumoperitoneum/positioning may be unsafe (hemodynamic/ventilatory intolerance)
- Other patient- or disease-specific factors that make MIS inappropriate (e.g., hostile abdomen, severe adhesions, unstable physiology, etc.—not exhaustively listed in the document, but implied by “patient-by-patient basis”)

**Practical implication:** such patients are not “excluded from the guideline,” but the MIS recommendation **cannot be applied rigidly**.

### 2) Patients in whom ERAS elements are not feasible/safe to implement as designed
The guideline strongly supports ERAS (especially in colorectal surgery), but it highlights feasibility constraints that can limit use in some older adults, such as:
- **Lack of home support**
- **Transportation barriers / living far from the hospital**
- Need for **closer follow-up after discharge** in some contexts

**Practical implication:** ERAS may need modification; the guideline should not be used to justify discharge/early recovery targets if the patient’s social situation makes that unsafe.

### 3) Emergency/urgent surgery (not clearly covered)
The guideline’s framing and many recommendations (e.g., **4 weeks** smoking/alcohol cessation, prehabilitation “between diagnosis and treatment”) inherently assume **elective** surgery planning. It does not present an emergency-surgery pathway.

**Practical implication:** for urgent/emergent cases, many recommendations are not implementable; applying them as written would be inappropriate.

## C) What is *not* an exclusion criterion here (common misunderstanding)
- **Frailty, comorbidity, or very advanced age** are *not* listed as reasons to exclude patients from the guideline. In fact, the guideline exists because these issues are common in older adults.
- The document does **not** provide a list like “do not use ERAS in X” or “do not use MIS in Y.” Instead, it repeatedly states decisions must be individualized.

If you tell me the specific surgery type (colorectal vs UGI vs HPB vs hernia) and whether it’s elective vs urgent, I can translate the above into a more concrete “who should not be managed under this pathway as written” checklist for that scenario.",periop,exclusion_criteria_extraction
PMC12338446.txt,"## TARGET POPULATION (extracted from the guideline text)

### Overall guideline target population (who the ERATIC Part 1 recommendations are for)
- **Trauma patients with major injuries and polytrauma**, managed using an ERAS-style approach across **pre-hospital, resuscitation-room/ED, intra-operative, and early post-operative phases**.
- Focus is on **torso and polytrauma patients who require admission to intensive care (ICU)**, including:
  - ICU admission **post-operative** (after surgical/endovascular intervention), or
  - ICU admission **after non-operative management (NOM)** when the patient requires **intubation or non-invasive ventilation, vasoactive drug therapy, or renal replacement therapy**.
- Applies to trauma from **sudden acute kinetic energy transfer** causing injury, including **intentional and unintentional** mechanisms.
- Includes **penetrating or blunt trauma** with **major tissue injury**, potentially with **traumatic shock**, **systemic inflammatory response**, and **risk of organ failure** after **torso and extremity injury**.
- The guideline notes applicability **“for all age groups throughout their hospital stay”**, with **pediatric-specific considerations addressed where relevant** in sections (and more in Paper 3).

### Explicit exclusions / out-of-scope populations (as stated)
- **Burns**
- **Drowning**
- **Isolated traumatic brain injury (isolated TBI)**  
  (TBI may still be discussed when it is part of polytrauma; the exclusion is *isolated* TBI.)

---

## Target-population segments within the guideline (with specific details)

### 1) Major trauma vs polytrauma (definitions used to define the population)
- **Major trauma (multiple/multi-system injury):** injury to **more than one organ system** of **moderate or severe** extent.
- **Polytrauma patient:** multisystem injury **with physiological aberrations** (i.e., not just multiple injuries, but also deranged physiology).

### 2) Torso trauma focus (anatomical population definition)
- **Torso trauma** is defined as injury involving regions **from the neck to the hips**, including:
  - **pelvis**
  - **thorax**
  - **abdomen**
  - plus “junctional zones”:
    - **thoracic inlet**
    - **thoraco-abdominal region**
    - **pelvic outlet**

### 3) ICU-requiring trauma subgroup (a key practical target population)
Patients with major trauma admitted to ICU either:
- **after intervention** (surgical or endovascular), or
- **directly from ED** when selected for **NOM**, **where the patient needs**:
  - **intubation or non-invasive ventilation**, and/or
  - **vasoactive drug therapy**, and/or
  - **renal replacement therapy**

### 4) Operative vs non-operative management subpopulations (as repeatedly referenced)
- **Hemodynamically normal/normalized blunt trauma patients** (especially solid organ injuries) are a core population for **selective NOM**.
- **Penetrating trauma patients** are generally treated operatively in many centers, but the guideline identifies a subpopulation where NOM may apply:
  - **selected patients**
  - in **selected experienced high-volume centers**
  - **hemodynamically normal(ized)**
  - **isolated solid organ injury on CT** (notably **liver** and **kidney**)
  - with **rapid access to operating facilities** if NOM fails

### 5) Organ-injury specific target subgroups explicitly mentioned
These are not separate “overall” target populations, but the guideline repeatedly frames recommendations around these subgroups:

- **Chest wall injury / rib fractures**
  - includes **ventilated flail chest** patients (highest level evidence discussed)
  - also mentions potential benefit in **TBI polytrauma** and **older patients**
- **Blunt aortic injury (BAI)**
  - **minimal BAI (grade I–II)** vs **moderate–severe BAI**
- **Splenic injury**
  - **grossly unstable with intraabdominal bleeding** (operative/splenectomy)
  - **stable/normalized adults** with CT extravasation (angiographic embolization)
- **Liver injury**
  - **hemodynamically compromised non-responders** (operative/damage control)
  - **stable after resuscitation** (NOM ± angiography based on clinical signs)
- **Pancreatic injury**
  - **grade 1–2** (no duct injury) vs **grade 3** vs **grade 4–5**
- **Renal injury**
  - NOM emphasized for **all grades** in **hemodynamically normal/normalized** patients (including **children**), with operative nephrectomy more likely in those who require surgery

## Consolidated “TARGET POPULATION” statement (faithful to the guideline wording/intent)
**These recommendations apply to patients with major trauma and polytrauma—particularly torso and extremity trauma from blunt or penetrating mechanisms—who have physiological derangement and are at risk of organ failure, and especially those requiring ICU-level care for post-operative or non-operative management. The guideline excludes burns, drowning, and isolated traumatic brain injury, while addressing pediatric considerations where relevant.**",periop,target_population_extraction
PMC12338446.txt,"These ERATIC (ERAS Trauma + ICU) recommendations are intended for **major trauma / polytrauma patients who are likely to require ICU-level care**, across age groups. The paper also states several **explicit exclusions** (and a few important **practical “not appropriate to apply as-written” situations**).

## Explicit exclusion criteria (patients the guideline is not written for)

### 1) Isolated traumatic brain injury (isolated TBI)
- The guideline **excludes isolated TBI** as the primary injury pattern.
- Meaning: if the patient’s main/only major injury is brain injury (even if severe), and they do not have major torso/extremity polytrauma driving the physiology, these recommendations are **not intended to be applied as the primary pathway**.

### 2) Burn trauma
- Patients whose primary problem is **burn injury** are excluded.
- Burn care has distinct resuscitation, nutrition, infection, and operative timing principles that differ from ERAS-style trauma pathways.

### 3) Drowning (submersion injury)
- **Drowning/submersion** patients are excluded.
- Their physiology and priorities (hypoxia, aspiration/ARDS, hypothermia, etc.) differ substantially from kinetic-energy trauma.

### 4) (Implied by scope) Patients who are *not* major trauma / polytrauma
- The guideline is designed around **major injury and polytrauma**, especially the **ICU-requiring group**.
- Patients with **minor trauma** or isolated low-severity injuries who do not need ICU-level support are **outside the intended population**, even though some individual elements (e.g., antibiotic prophylaxis principles) may still be relevant.

## Important “do not apply blindly” groups (not formal exclusions, but the guideline itself limits applicability)

These are not stated as exclusions in the same way as burns/drowning/isolated TBI, but the document repeatedly emphasizes that many ERAS elements depend on physiology and resources—so in the following situations the guideline cannot be applied wholesale and must be individualized:

### A) Patients who are hemodynamically unstable or not “normalized” after resuscitation
- Many recommendations (especially around **non-operative management (NOM)**, early feeding, mobilization, timing of definitive surgery) assume the patient is **hemodynamically normal or normalized**.
- If the patient remains in shock, needs ongoing massive transfusion, or has uncontrolled hemorrhage, then **damage control resuscitation/surgery** principles dominate and several ERAS-style steps are not applicable until stabilization.

### B) Patients needing immediate life-saving operative intervention where pathway steps would delay hemorrhage control
- The guideline explicitly prioritizes **rapid transfer and hemorrhage control**; anything that delays definitive control is inappropriate.
- Example: extensive prehospital interventions or prolonged ED optimization when the patient needs immediate OR/IR.

### C) Settings without the required monitoring/response capability (especially for NOM/SNOM)
- Selective NOM (particularly for penetrating trauma) is described as appropriate only in **selected experienced centers** with:
  - correct imaging/assessment capability, and
  - **rapid access to the OR** if NOM fails, and
  - ability to **monitor for deterioration**.
- If those system requirements are not met, then applying NOM/SNOM recommendations would be unsafe.

### D) Injury patterns outside the “torso + polytrauma” focus
- The guideline is framed around **torso and extremity injury with systemic physiological derangement**.
- Highly specialized domains (e.g., isolated hand trauma, isolated facial trauma, isolated spine without polytrauma physiology) are not the main target and may not map well to the recommendations.

## One nuance: TBI is excluded only when *isolated*
- The paper excludes **isolated** TBI, but it does discuss some topics “with or without TBI” (e.g., rib fixation in polytrauma with TBI).
- So: **polytrauma with associated TBI** can still fall within scope; **isolated TBI** does not.

If you tell me the patient population you’re planning to apply this to (e.g., “adult blunt polytrauma ICU admissions” or “penetrating abdominal trauma at a non–level-1 center”), I can translate the above into a clear “include/exclude” checklist for your local protocol.",periop,exclusion_criteria_extraction
PMC6510875.txt,"I can’t extract text from the “attached guideline” because no file/image was actually attached in your message. If you upload the guideline (PDF/image/text), I can extract the exact **Target Population** wording verbatim and segment it by subpopulation.

In the meantime, based on the guideline text you pasted (Japan Esophageal Society practice guidelines 2017: part 2), there is **no single, explicit “TARGET POPULATION” section** written in the same style as your examples. Instead, the document defines *implicit* target populations within each chapter/setting. Below are the **target-population statements I can extract from the provided text**, organized by clinical context, with significant details and scope boundaries.

---

## 1) Endoscopic treatment (ER: EMR/ESD) — target population
**Population:** Patients with **superficial esophageal cancer** being considered for **endoscopic resection (ER)**.

**Key inclusion details (as stated):**
- Lesions where depth of invasion **does not extend beyond the mucosal layer (T1a)**.
- Especially lesions confined to:
  - **EP (epithelium)** or
  - **LPM (lamina propria mucosae)**  
  These are described as **extremely rarely associated with lymph-node metastasis**, therefore ER is “sufficiently radical treatment.”
- Lesions extending:
  - up to **muscularis mucosae (MM)**, or
  - **slightly infiltrating the submucosa (up to 200 μm)**  
  are described as **amenable** to mucosal resection but with **elevated LN metastasis risk** → “relative indications.”

**Important exclusions / not suitable for ER (as stated):**
- Cases with **insufficient mucosal elevation after submucosal injection** (e.g., difficult residual marginal lesions after ER; ER after radiotherapy/chemoradiotherapy).
- Cases with a **bleeding tendency**.
- These are “not suitable for ER” and other options (e.g., **PDT**) are referenced.

**Special subpopulation explicitly singled out for recommendation:**
- Patients whose ER specimen shows **pT1a-MM with positive vascular invasion** → guideline states:  
  “strong evidence to recommend an additional treatment” (surgery or chemoradiotherapy discussed as radical additional treatment).

---

## 2) Surgical treatment — Cervical esophageal carcinoma — target population
**Population:** Patients with **cervical esophageal carcinoma** being considered for surgery and/or (chemo)radiotherapy strategies where **larynx preservation vs laryngectomy** is a major decision.

**Key population characteristics (as stated):**
- Tumors occur in a region “densely packed with important structures” (trachea, large vessels, nerves, thyroid) and are “frequently associated with malignant invasions of adjacent organs.”
- **Lymph-node metastasis is frequently encountered**; often advanced at diagnosis.
- Surgery is often considered because “widespread metastasis is uncommon” compared with thoracic disease.

**Subpopulations by anatomic invasion (explicit indications):**
- **Larynx-preserving surgery**: indicated when tumor **has not invaded the pharynx, larynx, or trachea**.
- **Combined laryngectomy (laryngopharyngoesophagectomy)**: indicated when tumor **invades the pharynx, larynx, and trachea**, and may also be used when esophageal preservation for anastomosis is difficult even without direct pharyngeal invasion.

**Scope notes emphasized:**
- Treatment selection should consider **QOL** (loss of vocal function vs aspiration/pneumonia risk).
- No significant prognosis difference reported between surgery and radical chemoradiotherapy (as stated).

---

## 3) Surgical treatment — Thoracic esophageal carcinoma — target population
**Population:** Patients with **thoracic esophageal carcinoma**, particularly those requiring esophagectomy and lymphadenectomy decisions.

**Key inclusion details (as stated):**
- Thoracic disease is “often accompanied by extensive lymph-node metastasis” across **cervical, thoracic, and abdominal** regions.
- **T1b-SM2/SM3 or more advanced** lesions are treated as “advanced cancer cases” in this surgical context.
- “Depth of invasion beyond **T1a-MM** is a predictor of lymph-node metastasis.”

**Treatment-planning population segmentation (as stated):**
- Extent of lymph-node dissection determined case-by-case after preoperative evaluation of:
  - location, size, depth of invasion
  - imaging: **CT, US, MRI, PET**

---

## 4) Surgery — Carcinoma of the esophagogastric junction (EGJ) / abdominal esophageal carcinoma — target population
**Population:** Patients with **carcinoma of the esophagogastric junction**, especially where classification and optimal lymphadenectomy extent are uncertain.

**Key inclusion details (as stated):**
- Focus on EGJ tumors including:
  - **Nishi classification** (Japan) and
  - **Siewert classification** (overseas), with special uncertainty around **Siewert type II** / adenocarcinoma per Nishi.
- A working group proposal is described for tumors **≤ 4 cm in diameter** (retrospective basis) regarding optimal lymph-node resection extent.

**Important scope limitation (as stated):**
- The retrospective recommendations are limited because:
  - patients confined to tumors **≤4 cm**
  - few cases had dissection of upper/middle mediastinal nodes and para-aortic areas
- Prospective studies for **more advanced tumors** are ongoing.

---

## 5) Chemotherapy — unresectable advanced / recurrent esophageal cancer — target population
**Population:** Patients with **unresectable advanced** or **recurrent** esophageal cancer receiving **systemic chemotherapy**.

**Key inclusion details (as stated):**
- Chemotherapy is described as “standard therapy for unresectable advanced/recurrent esophageal cancer.”
- Second-line: patients “refractory to cisplatin + 5-FU.”
- Third-line: patients “refractory or intolerant to first- and second-line therapies” → **palliative symptomatic treatment** recommended; nivolumab phase II evidence mentioned.

---

## 6) Radiotherapy / Chemoradiotherapy — target populations
### 6A) Radiotherapy chapter — target population
**Population segmentation (as stated):**
- **Definitive treatment:** “concurrent chemoradiotherapy is recommended.”
- **Unresectable patients:** (chemo)radiotherapy selection “according to the PS”
  - **good PS:** chemoradiotherapy
  - **poor PS:** radiotherapy alone may be considered
- **Palliative radiotherapy:** for **cStage IVb** patients with **obstruction**
- Also considered for:
  - residual cancer after endoscopic treatment (T1a/T1b) or suspected LN metastasis
  - postoperative recurrence without distant metastasis

### 6B) Chemoradiotherapy chapter — target population
**Population:** Patients with esophageal cancer receiving **non-surgical definitive chemoradiotherapy**, including potentially curative intent.

**Key inclusion details (as stated):**
- “Chemoradiotherapy aimed at complete cure is indicated for **cStage 0 to IVa** cancer.”
- Considered an option for **resectable** cases who are **intolerant to surgery or refuse surgery**.

**Stage-specific subpopulations (as stated):**
- **cStage 0–I:** indicated for lesions:
  - covering **≥ 3/4 circumference** and difficult to treat endoscopically, and/or
  - invading **submucosa or deeper**
  - also notes risk context after ER: intramucosal lesions with vascular invasion / obvious submucosal invasion with LN metastasis risk
- **cStage II–III:** chemoradiotherapy discussed as potentially equivalent to surgery alone in one report; RTOG-type regimens referenced
- **cStage IVa:** when unresectable lesion is **limited to irradiation area**, chemoradiotherapy used as standard

## 7) Follow-up after treatment — target populations
**Population:** Patients after treatment for esophageal cancer, segmented by initial treatment modality.

**Subpopulations explicitly described:**
- Follow-up after **endoscopic resection**
- Follow-up after **radical surgery**
- Follow-up after **radical chemoradiotherapy**
- Also highlights patients at risk for:
  - **metachronous multiple esophageal cancers**
  - **metachronous double cancers** (notably gastric and head/neck)

---

## 8) Recurrent esophageal cancer — target population
**Population:** Patients with **recurrent esophageal cancer**, with management individualized by:
- initial treatment type (endoscopic, surgery, definitive chemoradiotherapy)
- recurrence pattern (lymph-node, local, distant organ, mixed)
- patient general condition at recurrence

---

## 9) Palliative care — target population
**Population:** Patients with esophageal cancer needing symptom relief/QOL support, including **from early stages**, and especially **terminal esophageal cancer**.

**Key symptom-driven subpopulation details (as stated):**
- Dysphagia, malnutrition, cough due to fistula/aspiration, chest pain
- Terminal-phase focus: obstruction-related dysphagia/malnutrition, airway obstruction/fistula, cachexia, distant metastasis symptoms, hypercalcemia
- Interventions mentioned: palliative RT/CRT, esophageal/airway stenting, bypass surgery, nutritional fistula/PEG

# To produce the output you want (verbatim “TARGET POPULATION” extraction)
Please upload the guideline file (PDF/image) or paste the section that contains “Target population / Scope / Intended users / Patients” language. Then I will:
1) extract the **exact target population text verbatim** (with quotes),
2) list **inclusions/exclusions**, staging, setting, age, disease status,
3) segment into **distinct target populations** if the guideline defines more than one.",periop,target_population_extraction
PMC6510875.txt,"This document is a **practice guideline for esophageal cancer management**, not a “drug” or “device” guideline with a single universal inclusion/exclusion list. So the “exclusion criteria” are mostly **treatment‑specific**: i.e., which patients are **not appropriate candidates for a given recommended approach** (endoscopic resection, surgery, chemoradiotherapy, etc.). Based on the text you provided, the clearest explicit “cannot use” criteria are for **endoscopic resection (ER)**, plus some practical non-candidacy statements for other modalities.

Below is a structured summary of **who should not be managed according to the ER pathway** (and therefore should be directed to other options in the guideline), and **who is generally outside the scope/assumptions of certain recommendations**.

---

## 1) Patients who are **not candidates for Endoscopic Resection (ER: EMR/ESD)**

### A. Tumor factors: invasion deeper than ER indications
ER is described as sufficiently radical mainly for **T1a lesions limited to EP/LPM** (very low LN metastasis risk). Once invasion is deeper, ER is no longer “definitive” and may be inappropriate as sole therapy.

Patients generally **not suitable for ER as curative treatment** include:
- **Invasion beyond the mucosa (beyond T1a)**, i.e. clear **submucosal invasion** (T1b) or deeper.
- Even within T1a, lesions at **muscularis mucosae (MM)** or **slight submucosal invasion up to 200 μm** are only “relative indications” because LN metastasis risk is higher—so some patients in this group may be steered away from ER alone and toward additional therapy.

### B. Technical/anatomic factors making ER difficult or unsafe (explicitly stated)
The guideline explicitly says ER is **not suitable** when:
- There is **insufficient mucosal elevation after submucosal injection** (a “non-lifting” situation), particularly:
  - during **additional ER for residual marginal lesions after ER**
  - when attempting ER **after radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy** (fibrosis → poor lifting)
- The patient has a **bleeding tendency** (coagulopathy/anticoagulation context implied), because of higher procedural bleeding risk.

In these situations, the guideline indicates **other options** should be considered (it mentions **PDT** as an example).

### C. Pathology after ER that makes “ER alone” non-curative (needs additional treatment)
This is not “cannot undergo ER,” but it is a clear “cannot be managed with ER alone” group:

- **pT1a-MM with positive vascular invasion** after ER  
  → the guideline gives a **strong recommendation for additional treatment** (e.g., surgery or chemoradiotherapy), because of meaningful LN metastasis risk.

(Practically, similar logic often applies to other non-curative features—positive margins, deeper invasion than expected, etc.—but in your excerpt the explicit strong recommendation is for **MM + vascular invasion**.)

---

## 2) Patients who are **not candidates for larynx-preserving surgery** (cervical esophageal cancer section)

For **cervical esophageal carcinoma**, the guideline states:

- **Larynx-preserving surgery is indicated only when the tumor has not invaded the pharynx, larynx, or trachea.**

Therefore, patients who **cannot use the larynx-preserving surgery approach** include those with:
- **Tumor invasion of the pharynx**
- **Tumor invasion of the larynx**
- **Tumor invasion of the trachea**

These patients are instead candidates for **combined laryngectomy procedures** (laryngopharyngoesophagectomy) or non-surgical organ-preservation strategies depending on goals and feasibility.

---

## 3) Patients who are **not candidates for chemoradiotherapy vs radiotherapy alone** (performance status–based)

The radiotherapy section makes a practical eligibility distinction:

- **Chemoradiotherapy** is indicated for **unresectable patients with a good performance status (PS)**.
- **Radiotherapy alone** may be considered for patients with a **poor PS**.

So, patients with **poor PS** are generally **not candidates for concurrent chemoradiotherapy** (they may still receive RT alone or best supportive care depending on context).

---

## 4) Important “scope limits” (who the guideline may not directly apply to)
Not explicitly listed in your excerpt as exclusions, but important when interpreting “who cannot use this guideline”:

- The recommendations are written for **esophageal cancer** (and some Barrett’s carcinoma content). Patients with **non-malignant disease** or other primary tumors are outside scope.
- Many recommendations assume access to specialized staging, pathology, and multidisciplinary care; patients treated in settings without these capabilities may not be able to follow the pathway as written (a practical limitation rather than a medical exclusion).

---

### If you want, I can turn this into a one-page “exclusion checklist” for each modality (ER / surgery / CRT / RT / chemo) using only statements that are explicitly present in the 2017 JES text (and flag where the guideline is implicit vs explicit).",periop,exclusion_criteria_extraction
PMC5100245.txt,"## TARGET POPULATION (as stated/implied in the guideline)

This document is **not a clinical patient-treatment guideline** (like melanoma, breast cancer, etc.). It is a **professional certification/examination guideline** for perioperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). Therefore, the “target population” is primarily **healthcare professionals/candidates** (and secondarily the **patients they examine during training/exams**).

---

## 1) Primary Target Population: Fellowship (F-TEE) examination candidates (health professionals)

### Target population text (extracted/closely paraphrased from the guideline)
- The perioperative TEE fellowship (F-TEE) program is **“aimed at providing and improving the expertise of all echocardiographers manifesting a strong interest in attaining the goals… for achieving certification.”**
- **Eligibility:** “**Any professional/postdoctoral or postgraduate student in any field relating to cardiac sciences such as cardiac anesthesia, cardiology, cardiac surgery, cardiac critical care wanting to learn TEE, who fulfills the training requirements satisfactorily with completed logbook and records of the TEE performed**… are eligible to sit for the F-TEE.”
- The exam is **“not restricted to the above but open to noncardiac anesthetists/intensivists as well provided they satisfy the training requirements.”**
- Candidates should be **“in good standing… certified so by the head of the unit/department.”**

### Significant details (who is included)
- **Profession/discipline:**  
  - Cardiac anesthesia, cardiology, cardiac surgery, cardiac critical care  
  - Also **non-cardiac anesthetists/intensivists** if training requirements are met
- **Career stage:** professional, postdoctoral, or postgraduate students in relevant fields
- **Prerequisites to sit the exam:**  
  - Completed training requirements  
  - **Completed logbook** and **TEE case records** (submitted via CD/pen drive)  
  - Good standing confirmed by department/unit head

### Important exclusions/limits (implied)
- People who **do not meet training requirements**, **do not have the required logbook/case documentation**, or are **not certified in good standing** by their department/unit head fall outside the eligible target group.

---

## 2) Secondary Target Population: Examiners and the examination system stakeholders

### Target population text (extracted/closely paraphrased)
- The guidelines are provided **“to serve as a guide to both the examinee and examiner ensuring standardization, efficiency, and competency of the IACTA F-TEE certification process.”**

### Significant details
- Applies to **examiners/examination committee** involved in:
  - Written exam (MCQs + videos)
  - Practical/oral/hands-on components
  - Logbook and CD/pen drive assessment
  - Standardization and objective grading

---

## 3) Patient population involved (contextual, not the main “target population”)

This guideline does not define a single disease-based patient cohort. Instead, it references **patients encountered during perioperative/ICU TEE practice and training**.

### Patient-related text (extracted/closely paraphrased)
- Candidates are motivated to use TEE **“during the perioperative care of patients undergoing cardiac/noncardiac surgery and during Intensive Care Unit care.”**
- Candidates must **“interact with all the patients and obtain a detailed history and perform a detailed physical examination and procure informed consent before conducting a TEE examination.”**
- Logbook case-mix expectations include patients with:
  - LV function assessment
  - Valvular lesions undergoing repair/replacement
  - Pericardial disease
  - Aortic disease
  - Congenital heart disease (examples given: ASD, VSD, TOF, PDA)
  - Suspected endocarditis
  - Cardiomyopathy (including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy)

### Significant details (how patients are “in scope”)
- Patients are included insofar as they are:
  - Undergoing **perioperative TEE** (cardiac or noncardiac surgery) and/or
  - In **ICU care** where TEE is used, and/or
  - Represent the **case mix** used for candidate training documentation (logbook/CD)

### Notable constraints
- The guideline emphasizes **consent**, **supervision**, and **safe probe cleaning/disinfection** practices during patient contact.
- It does **not** provide clinical indications/contraindications for TEE in specific diseases; it focuses on **training, competency, and exam process**.

## Consolidated “TARGET POPULATION” statement (ready to paste)

**TARGET POPULATION**  
These guidelines apply to **healthcare professionals (postgraduate/postdoctoral trainees or practicing professionals)** seeking **IACTA/Indian College of Cardiac Anaesthesia perioperative TEE fellowship (F-TEE) certification**, including those in **cardiac anesthesia, cardiology, cardiac surgery, and cardiac critical care**, and also **non-cardiac anesthetists/intensivists** who meet the required training criteria. Eligible candidates must be **in good standing**, have a **completed logbook** and **documented TEE case records** (CD/pen drive) as specified. The document also guides **examiners/examination committees** to standardize assessment. Patient involvement is limited to those encountered during **perioperative/ICU TEE practice** used for supervised training and competency assessment (e.g., valvular, ventricular function, aortic, pericardial, congenital, endocarditis, cardiomyopathy cases).

If you upload the original PDF (or images of it), I can extract the exact wording verbatim and cite page/section locations.",periop,target_population_extraction
PMC5100245.txt,"This document is **not a clinical “who can/can’t undergo TEE” guideline**. It is an **exam/training guideline** for the IACTA/ICCA **perioperative TEE fellowship (F‑TEE) certification**. So the relevant “exclusion criteria” are mainly **who cannot use/enter this fellowship pathway** (i.e., cannot apply for/complete the certification under these rules), rather than which patients cannot undergo TEE.

## 1) People who are effectively excluded from using this fellowship guideline (cannot be certified under it)

### A. Do not meet eligibility/training prerequisites
You cannot use this pathway if you are **not**:
- A relevant **postgraduate/postdoctoral trainee or professional** in a cardiac-sciences–related field (cardiac anesthesia, cardiology, cardiac surgery, cardiac critical care), **or** a noncardiac anesthetist/intensivist **who still fulfills the same training requirements**.
- In **good standing**, with certification/endorsement by the **head of the unit/department**.

### B. Cannot document required training volume and duration
You are excluded if you cannot submit a compliant logbook:
- **100 TEE cases over 24 months**
  - **50 supervised and interpreted under supervision**
  - **50 performed “independently”** (as per their program definition)  
- Certified/attested by the **head of unit/department**.
- If the logbook is **not as per recommended norms**, the document explicitly states the candidate **will not be able to clear the examination even if** theory and practical are passed.

### C. Cannot provide the required case recordings (CD/pen drive) in the required format
You are excluded if you cannot submit:
- **Video/loops of 25 cases** from the logbook
- Properly **edited**, **high-quality**, complete studies
- **De-identified** (no patient identifiers)
- Correctly organized (Case 1, Case 2, etc.) and consistent with the logbook list.

### D. Do not meet exam performance thresholds
You cannot proceed/qualify if:
- You score **<60% in MCQs** or **<60% in video section** (must get 60% in **each** to be eligible for practical).
- You do not satisfy the examiners in **oral, hands-on, logbook, and grand viva**.
- The guideline also states **no partial accreditation** (passing written alone does not count).

### E. Cannot comply with mandatory supervision and patient-interaction requirements during training
The guideline requires that:
- TEE procedures during training are performed under **direct supervision** of a **TEE-certified or sufficiently experienced consultant**.
- Candidates are expected to **interact with patients**, take history/exam, and **obtain informed consent** before TEE.
If your setting cannot support these requirements, you effectively cannot follow the guideline as written.

### F. Practical limitation mentioned: pregnancy and probe cleaning/disinfection
The document notes candidates are expected to be familiar with probe cleaning/disinfection, **except**:
- **Pregnant candidates** *unless* they have **OSHA-certified protective equipment** during cleaning.
This is not an exclusion from the fellowship, but it is an explicit exception/limitation in applying that part of the guideline.

---

## 2) “Which patients cannot use this guideline?”
This document **does not list patient exclusion criteria/contraindications for TEE** (e.g., esophageal pathology, recent upper GI surgery, etc.). It only states that candidates must obtain consent and be supervised.

If you want, I can list the **standard clinical contraindications to performing TEE** (absolute/relative) as used in perioperative practice—but that would be based on broader TEE practice guidelines, not on this fellowship-exam document.",periop,exclusion_criteria_extraction
PMC11222175.txt,"## TARGET POPULATION (extracted from the provided guideline text)

### Primary target population (overall scope)
**Neugeborene und Säuglinge (children under 1 year of age)** who require **airway management / airway securing (Atemwegssicherung)**—particularly **via endotracheal intubation**—in settings such as:
- **Anesthesia (Anästhesie)**
- **Intensive care (Intensivmedizin)**
- **Emergency medicine / resuscitation (Notfallmedizin / Reanimation)**

**Key scope emphasis from the text**
- The guideline was created specifically because **previous airway guidelines explicitly excluded children under 1 year**, despite this being the age group with **the most frequent complications** during intubation.
- The recommendations focus on **endotracheal intubation-related airway management** across seven topic areas (assessment, preparation, techniques, difficult airway management, tube position confirmation, extubation strategies, human factors/competencies).

---

## Target population segments mentioned explicitly in the text (with significant details)

### 1) Neugeborene (newborns), including high-risk newborn context
**Population:** **Neugeborene**, especially in contexts where apnea tolerance is low and rapid deterioration can occur.

**Why high-risk (details stated):**
- Rapid progression to **hypoxemia and bradycardia up to cardiac arrest** if oxygenation/ventilation is not ensured.
- **Sedation/anesthesia** can cause upper airway obstruction due to loss of pharyngeal tone and tongue/hyoid displacement.
- In newborns (and especially premature infants), there are:
  - **Reduced respiratory drive**
  - Increased risk of **reflex apnea** or **laryngospasm**
  - **Lower respiratory mechanical reserves**
  - **Markedly reduced apnea tolerance**

**Intervention context highlighted:**
- **Apnoeic oxygenation during intubation is recommended for newborns** (“während der endotrachealen Intubation bei Neugeborenen”).

---

### 2) Früh- und Neugeborene (premature and newborn infants) as a particularly vulnerable subgroup
**Population:** **Frühgeborene (preterm infants)** and **Neugeborene**.

**Specific risk detail stated:**
- Intubation without adequate medication (“nicht adäquat medikamentös abgeschirmt”) is painful/stressful and is associated in **preterm infants** with **higher rates of intracranial hemorrhage and cerebral infarction**.

**Clinical implication in the guideline text:**
- The guideline supports **adequate sedation/analgesia (and often muscle relaxation when appropriate)** rather than awake/unsedated intubation (except in certain resuscitation contexts).

---

### 3) Säuglinge (infants) including “kleine Säuglinge” (small infants)
**Population:** **Säuglinge**, including **small infants**, requiring airway management/intubation.

**Notable points tied to this population:**
- **Videolaryngoscopy** with age-appropriate standard blades is recommended as **first choice** for intubation of **newborns and infants**.
- **Supraglottic airway devices (SGA)** (e.g., laryngeal mask) are described as usually enabling ventilation in **newborns and small infants**, often faster and with higher first-attempt placement success than endotracheal tubes.
- For **children > 3 kg** (which includes many infants), **cuffed or uncuffed tubes** can be used safely; cuffed tubes may reduce the need for tube exchange due to leak (important in emergencies and for less experienced users).

---

### 4) Infants with suspected/anticipated difficult airway (including syndromic/anatomic risk)
**Population:** **Neugeborene und Säuglinge** with predictors of a **difficult airway**, including those with congenital syndromes or craniofacial/anatomic abnormalities.

**Predictors explicitly listed in the text:**
- **Micrognathia, retrognathia, prognathia**
- **Limited/small mouth opening**
- **Facial asymmetry**
- **Fixed cervical spine**
- **Cleft lip/palate (Lippen-Kiefer-Gaumenspalte)**
- **Tumors** in mouth/pharynx/neck

**Syndromic examples explicitly named:**
- **Pierre-Robin syndrome**
- **Crouzon syndrome**
- **Treacher-Collins syndrome**

**What studies in these populations show (as stated):**
- More frequent **difficult mask ventilation** due to upper airway obstruction
- Less frequent **difficult intubation**
- Oxygenation/ventilation via **SGA is mostly successful**

---

### 5) Resuscitation / emergency contexts involving newborns and infants
**Population/context:** **Neonatal/infant resuscitation**, including **delivery room (Kreißsaal)** scenarios.

**Scope detail stated:**
- Outside of resuscitation, intubation without adequate sedation/analgesia has largely been abandoned.
- In CPR, **mask ventilation or SGA** is described as **not inferior** to tracheal intubation regarding survival or neurological outcome (in the cited summary statement).

---

## Out-of-scope / exclusions (only what is explicitly stated or clearly implied)
- The text does **not** define a target population beyond **neonates and infants (<1 year)**.
- It also notes that prior guidelines excluded this age group; this guideline is specifically for this **previously excluded** population.
- No explicit disease-specific inclusion/exclusion criteria (like oncology staging) are provided in the excerpt; the scope is **procedure/context-based** (airway management/intubation), not diagnosis-based.

If you upload the PDF or provide the full guideline document (not just the excerpt), I can extract the **exact “Zielpopulation/Target population” section verbatim** (if present) and format it exactly like your examples.",periop,target_population_extraction
PMC11222175.txt,"Aus dem von dir zitierten Text lassen sich **keine klassischen „Exclusion criteria“ im Sinne einer Patientenausschlussliste** (wie man sie aus Studien kennt) herauslesen. Es handelt sich um eine klinische Leitlinie/Handlungsempfehlung zur **endotrachealen Intubation bei Neugeborenen und Säuglingen** – sie ist also primär über die **Zielpopulation** definiert. „Nicht anwendbar“ ist sie vor allem dann, wenn Patient*in oder Situation **außerhalb dieser Zielpopulation bzw. außerhalb des behandelten Settings** liegen oder wenn **andere, spezifischere Leitlinien** Vorrang haben.

Im Detail: Welche Patient*innen „können“ diese Leitlinie nicht (bzw. nicht primär) nutzen?

## 1) Patient*innen außerhalb der Zielpopulation (wichtigster Ausschluss)
Die Leitlinie adressiert **Neugeborene und Säuglinge** (typischerweise: **< 12 Monate**; Neugeborene: erste 28 Lebenstage). Damit gilt:

- **Kinder ≥ 1 Jahr**: fallen nicht in den Geltungsbereich; hier sollten pädiatrische Atemwegsleitlinien für Kleinkinder/Kinder angewendet werden.
- **Erwachsene/Jugendliche**: klar ausgeschlossen.

## 2) Situationen, die nicht der Fokus der Leitlinie sind (Kontext-/Setting-Ausschluss)
Der Text fokussiert auf **Atemwegssicherung durch endotracheale Intubation** (inkl. Alternativen wie SGA) in Anästhesie/Intensiv-/Notfallmedizin. Nicht primär abgedeckt sind daher Patient*innen/Situationen, in denen andere Protokolle dominieren:

- **Reanimation im Kreißsaal/Neonatalreanimation**: wird im Text explizit als Sonderfall erwähnt („außer im Rahmen von Wiederbelebungsmaßnahmen (z. B. im Kreißsaal) …“).  
  → Für diese Patient*innen gelten vorrangig **NRP/ERC-Neonatalreanimationsalgorithmen**; die Leitlinie ist dann höchstens ergänzend.
- **Atemwegsmanagement ohne Intubationsziel** (z. B. rein nichtinvasive Atemunterstützung als Therapieziel ohne Intubationsindikation): nur am Rand (Extubations-/NIV-Abschnitt), aber nicht als primäre Leitlinie.

## 3) Patient*innen, bei denen die empfohlene Technik/Option ausdrücklich ungeeignet ist
Das ist kein „Ausschluss von der Leitlinie“, aber ein **Ausschluss bestimmter Maßnahmen** bei genau dieser Population:

- **Neugeborene/Säuglinge in „cannot ventilate – cannot intubate“**:  
  Die bei Erwachsenen empfohlene **Notfallkoniotomie** ist laut Text **ungeeignet**.  
  → Diese Patient*innen „können“ also **nicht** nach einem Erwachsenen-Koniotomie-Algorithmus behandelt werden; stattdessen wird (wenn nötig) **chirurgische Tracheotomie** als Rettungsweg genannt.

## 4) Patient*innen, bei denen lokale Ressourcen/Kompetenzen fehlen (praktischer Anwendungs-Ausschluss)
Leitlinien setzen voraus, dass bestimmte **Kompetenzen/Equipment** vorhanden sind (z. B. Videolaryngoskopie, flexible/rigide Optiken, Teamtraining). Wenn das nicht gegeben ist, ist die Leitlinie nicht „ungültig“, aber **nicht vollständig umsetzbar**. Praktisch betrifft das:

- extrem kleine Früh-/Neugeborene oder komplexe Atemwege, wenn **altersgerechtes Equipment** (SGA, Tuben, Optiken) nicht verfügbar ist,
- Situationen ohne Möglichkeit zur **sofortigen Eskalation** (Expert*in, HNO/Chirurgie, ggf. ECMO-Team).

Dann muss man auf **lokal verfügbare, sichere Alternativen** ausweichen bzw. frühzeitig verlegen/eskalieren.

## 5) Keine expliziten patientenbezogenen Kontraindikationen im Text
Wichtig: Im bereitgestellten Auszug stehen **keine** Ausschlüsse wie „nicht anwenden bei … (z. B. bestimmten Herzfehlern, bestimmten Infektionen, Gewicht < x kg)“. Es gibt nur **Hinweise zur Auswahl** (z. B. gecufft/ungecufft „bei Kindern über 3 kg … sicher“, nasale Intubation mit Blutungsrisiko abwägen etc.), aber das sind **keine generellen Ausschlusskriterien** der Leitlinie.

Wenn du mir sagst, **welche Leitlinie genau** (Titel/Journal/Link/DOI – du hast oben eine DOI angedeutet) und ob du die **Originalpublikation** oder nur diese praxisnahe Zusammenfassung meinst, kann ich dir die **tatsächlich im Dokument genannten** „Scope/Exclusions“ (falls vorhanden) wortgetreu und strukturiert herausarbeiten.",periop,exclusion_criteria_extraction
PMC10520188.txt,"## TARGET POPULATION (as stated/defined in the guideline)

### Primary target population (overall scope)
- **Adult patients** who experience **cardiac arrest in the perioperative period**, particularly in the **operating room / peri-procedural environment**.
- The guideline is intended for **identification, treatment, and prevention** of **perioperative cardiac arrest**, and is designed to **complement** European Resuscitation Council (ERC) resuscitation guidance in this specific setting.

**Key scope qualifiers from the text**
- Evidence synthesis and recommendations are **limited to adult patients**:  
  - “Data analysed described investigation in the perioperative period and were **limited to adult patients**.”
- **Paediatric patients are excluded**:  
  - “Studies relating solely to **paediatric patients were excluded** due to the differences in physiology and clinical approach…”
  - Mixed adult/paediatric studies were only considered if the **majority were adult**.

---

## TARGET POPULATION segments (sub-populations explicitly addressed in recommendations/sections)

### 1) Adult perioperative cardiac arrest patients (general OR/peri-procedural arrest)
**Who this includes**
- Adults who arrest **during anaesthesia and/or surgery** in a **fully monitored** environment (typical OR context).
- Adults in the **perioperative/peri-procedural** setting where causes may be related to:
  - the patient’s condition,
  - the anaesthetic technique,
  - the surgical procedure complexity.

**Notable boundary**
- When perioperative evidence is limited, the guideline may **extrapolate** from other settings (e.g., pre-hospital/in-hospital), but the **intended population remains perioperative adults**.

---

### 2) Adult intubated perioperative cardiac arrest patients (monitoring-focused subgroup)
**Who this includes**
- Adults in perioperative arrest who are **intubated** (common in OR), where **end-tidal CO₂ (ETCO₂)** monitoring is relevant during CPR.

**Why this is a distinct target subgroup in the document**
- Recommendations specifically reference ETCO₂ use “in **intubated patients during CPR**” to help predict ROSC/survival and guide CPR.

---

### 3) Adult peri-procedural cardiac arrest patients where advanced monitoring/echo is feasible
**Who this includes**
- Adults in peri-procedural arrest where:
  - **expertise is present**,
  - **equipment is available**,
  - and the **patient’s condition allows** use of **transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE)** during arrest.

**Purpose**
- To identify the **aetiology** of arrest and guide management intraoperatively.

---

### 4) Cause-specific perioperative cardiac arrest sub-populations (reversible-cause groups)
The guideline repeatedly frames recommendations around **adult perioperative cardiac arrest** where the arrest is due to (or suspected to be due to) specific causes:

#### a) Gas embolism with cardiac arrest (perioperative)
- Adults who develop cardiac arrest **in the setting of suspected/known gas embolism** (e.g., procedure-related sources described such as hysteroscopy, transthoracic needle lung biopsy).

#### b) Massive pulmonary embolism causing perioperative cardiac arrest
- Adults with perioperative arrest attributed to **massive PE**, where **VA-ECMO** may be used as a bridge to definitive therapy, and **thrombolysis** may be considered when ECMO is unavailable (with perioperative bleeding-risk considerations).

#### c) Pulseless shockable rhythms in the perioperative setting
- Adults in perioperative arrest presenting with:
  - **ventricular fibrillation (VF)**, or
  - **pulseless ventricular tachycardia (pVT)**  
  (immediate defibrillation emphasized).

#### d) Asystole with p-waves (perioperative)
- Adults in perioperative arrest with **asystole where p-waves exist**, where **emergency temporary pacing** may be attempted if immediately available.

#### e) Haemorrhage / hypovolaemic cardiac arrest (perioperative)
- Adults in perioperative arrest due to **major bleeding/hypovolaemia**, explicitly treated as **fundamentally different** from “primary/medical” cardiac arrest.
- The guideline emphasizes prioritizing:
  - **haemorrhage control** and
  - **massive transfusion/volume replacement**,  
  with chest compressions discussed in that context.

#### f) Exsanguinating infra-diaphragmatic haemorrhage (peri-arrest/arrest)
- Adults with **non-compressible, exsanguinating torso haemorrhage** (infra-diaphragmatic) in **cardiac arrest or peri-arrest**, where **REBOA** or **resuscitative thoracotomy with aortic cross-clamping** may be considered as last-resort temporizing measures—**only** if rapid definitive haemorrhage control is available.

#### g) Tension pneumothorax causing (or suspected to cause) perioperative cardiac arrest
- Adults in perioperative arrest where **tension pneumothorax** is suspected/proven (including iatrogenic causes such as central line insertion, positive pressure ventilation, equipment failure).

#### h) Cardiac tamponade causing perioperative cardiac arrest
- Adults in perioperative arrest where **tamponade** is suspected/confirmed (including perioperative causes such as cardiac surgery, percutaneous cardiac interventions, central venous cannulation, laparoscopic surgery, etc.).
- Includes adults requiring **immediate pericardial decompression** (ultrasound-guided pericardiocentesis or thoracotomy in haemopericardium).

---

## Explicit exclusions / out-of-scope population (as stated)
- **Paediatric cardiac arrest patients** (excluded due to different physiology/management).
- The evidence base excludes (unless evidence is lacking altogether):
  - **case reports/series** and **retrospective studies** (though retrospective/expert opinion may be used when no other evidence exists).  
  *Note: this is an evidence-inclusion rule, not a population definition, but it affects what populations are represented in the evidence.*

If you want, I can rewrite the above into a single “TARGET POPULATION” block exactly in the style of your examples (one paragraph, with inclusions/exclusions).",periop,target_population_extraction
PMC10520188.txt,"This ESAIC/ESTES consensus guideline is intended for **adult patients who suffer (or are at imminent risk of) cardiac arrest in the perioperative/periprocedural setting** (i.e., in the operating room environment and closely related procedural areas). Patients/situations that are **outside scope**—and therefore should not be managed *solely* by this guideline—are mainly defined by the **population limits** and the **setting limits** the authors used when selecting evidence.

## 1) Age group excluded: paediatric patients
The guideline’s evidence review and recommendations are **limited to adults**.

- **Excluded:** studies “relating solely to paediatric patients.”
- **Reason given:** “differences in physiology and clinical approach” in children.
- **Mixed adult+paediatric studies:** only considered if the **majority were adults**.

**Practical implication:** If the patient is a **child/adolescent managed under paediatric pathways**, use paediatric perioperative arrest guidance (and paediatric ALS/PALS frameworks) rather than this adult-focused document.

## 2) Setting excluded: arrests not occurring in the perioperative/periprocedural environment
The guideline is specifically about **cardiac arrest in the perioperative period** and is meant to **complement** (not replace) European Resuscitation Council (ERC) ALS guidance.

So it is **not designed** for:
- **Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest** (street/home/ambulance), except where the authors explicitly extrapolated evidence due to lack of perioperative data.
- **General in-hospital ward arrests** not related to procedures/anaesthesia.
- **ICU cardiac arrest** that is not peri-procedural (again, except where extrapolation is mentioned).

**Practical implication:** If the arrest is not temporally and contextually tied to anaesthesia/surgery/procedures (with OR-type resources/monitoring), default to standard ERC ALS and the relevant specialty guidance.

## 3) Evidence-base exclusions (not “patients,” but important limits on applicability)
These are not patient-level exclusions, but they explain where the guideline may be **less applicable** because the underlying evidence was not taken from certain sources:

- **Case reports/series and retrospective studies** were generally **excluded** from the evidence synthesis **unless** higher-quality data were lacking (then expert opinion/retrospective data could inform statements).
- **Animal-only monitoring studies** were considered **not comparable** to humans; recommendations there are largely **expert opinion**.

**Practical implication:** For rare intraoperative scenarios where only case reports exist (or where your institution’s resources differ), recommendations may be weaker and require more local expert judgment.

## 4) Resource/feasibility constraints (situations where parts of the guideline may not be usable)
Some recommended interventions assume the presence of **specialist teams and equipment**. The guideline itself repeatedly conditions certain actions on availability/expertise, meaning that in some hospitals/patients those components are effectively “not usable,” e.g.:

- **Transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE):** suggested only “if the expertise is present, the equipment available, and the patient’s condition allows it.”
- **VA-ECMO / ECPR:** recommendations to consider ECMO as bridge therapy presume an established capability.
- **REBOA / resuscitative thoracotomy / open chest cardiac massage:** high-risk, requires trained teams and immediate access to definitive haemorrhage control; the guideline explicitly notes aortic occlusion is **not recommended** if definitive haemorrhage control is not immediately available.

**Practical implication:** A patient is not “excluded,” but **you cannot apply those sections** if your setting cannot safely deliver them.

---

### Bottom line (who “cannot use” this guideline)
1. **Paediatric patients** (children; and generally adolescents managed under paediatric protocols).  
2. **Patients arresting outside the perioperative/periprocedural context** (use standard ERC ALS and setting-specific guidance).  
3. **Patients in settings without the required expertise/equipment** for certain advanced interventions (those specific recommendations become non-applicable, though basic perioperative arrest principles still may help).

If you tell me the patient’s age and where/when the arrest occurred (OR, PACU, cath lab, ICU, ward, prehospital), I can map whether the guideline applies fully, partially, or not at all.",periop,exclusion_criteria_extraction
PMC6135479.txt,"## TARGET POPULATION (as stated/defined in the guideline)

### Primary target population (in-scope)
**Adult surgical/procedural patients with known or suspected obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) who require intraoperative anesthetic care.**

Significant details explicitly stated in the document:
- **Adults only:** the evidence review and focus are on **adult individuals (≥18 years of age)**.
- **OSA status can be “known or suspected”:** the guideline repeatedly frames recommendations for **patients with known or suspected OSA** (not only formally diagnosed cases).
- **Clinical context:** the guideline is specifically about **intraoperative management** (airway management, anesthetic drugs/agents, and anesthesia technique) for patients with OSA.
- **How “OSA / risk for OSA” was identified in the evidence base:** studies included patients where OSA presence/risk was based on:
  - **Polysomnography** (gold standard)  
  - **Screening questionnaires** (e.g., **STOP-Bang**)  
  - **Clinical assessment/diagnosis or chart diagnosis/medical history**  
  - **Administrative coding (ICD-9 codes)**

### Populations explicitly excluded / out of scope
**Patients with sleep-disordered breathing conditions other than OSA** were excluded from this guideline project:
- **Hypoventilation syndromes**
- **Periodic breathing**
- **Central apnea unrelated to OSA**

(Quote-level meaning from the guideline: *“Patients affected by sleep-disordered breathing unrelated to OSA… were not considered in this project.”*)

---

## Segmented “target populations” by recommendation sections (sub-populations the guideline repeatedly addresses)

Because this guideline is organized around intraoperative questions, the “target population” is best segmented into OSA adults undergoing specific intraoperative exposures:

### 1) Adults with known/suspected OSA undergoing airway management (Difficult airway section)
**Target population:** Adult patients with **known or suspected OSA** undergoing anesthesia where **airway management** is required (mask ventilation, intubation, supraglottic airway use, extubation planning).

Key population framing:
- OSA is treated as an **independent risk factor** for:
  - **Difficult intubation**
  - **Difficult mask ventilation**
  - Or **both combined**
- Evidence includes OSA identified by polysomnography, STOP-Bang, clinical diagnosis, chart diagnosis, or databases.

### 2) Adults with known/suspected OSA receiving intraoperative medications (Medication sections)
**Target population:** Adult patients with **known or suspected OSA** exposed to common intraoperative anesthetic/analgesic drugs, with emphasis on respiratory risk.

Subgroups called out by drug class:
- **OSA + neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs):** patients with OSA who receive NMBAs may be at increased risk of **residual neuromuscular blockade effects**, **hypoxemia**, or **respiratory failure**.
- **OSA + opioids:** patients with OSA may be at increased risk for **opioid-related adverse respiratory events**; guideline also flags possible **altered pain perception/opioid potency** in OSA.
- **OSA + propofol for procedural sedation (not induction of GA):** patients with OSA receiving propofol sedation for procedures (examples given: **drug-induced sleep endoscopy, GI endoscopy, dentistry**) may be at increased risk for **hypoxemic/respiratory events**.
- **OSA + IV benzodiazepine sedation:** patients with OSA may be at increased risk for **airway/respiratory compromise**; benzodiazepines are also discussed as being used to **induce airway collapse** for diagnostic purposes in OSA.
- **OSA + other agents (inhalational agents, ketamine, α-2 agonists):** the guideline repeatedly notes **insufficient/lacking evidence** specifically in OSA for some of these comparisons, but still frames the discussion around adult OSA patients.

### 3) Adults with known/suspected OSA where anesthesia technique choice is relevant (Regional vs general)
**Target population:** Adult patients with **OSA** undergoing surgery where there is a choice between **regional anesthesia** and **general anesthesia** (or combined techniques).

Key population framing:
- Recommendation applies **“when applicable”** (i.e., when regional anesthesia is feasible for the procedure and patient).
- Rationale ties this population to:
  - Avoiding **airway manipulation**
  - Reducing need for **neuromuscular blockade**
  - Reducing **opioid requirements** via multimodal/regional analgesia

---

## One-paragraph consolidated target population statement (usable as a “TARGET POPULATION” block)
**Adult patients (≥18 years) with known or suspected obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) undergoing procedures requiring intraoperative anesthetic management (airway management, anesthetic/analgesic drug administration, and/or selection of anesthesia technique). OSA status/risk may be established by polysomnography, screening tools (e.g., STOP-Bang), clinical or chart diagnosis/history, or administrative coding. Patients with sleep-disordered breathing conditions unrelated to OSA (e.g., hypoventilation syndromes, periodic breathing, or central apnea unrelated to OSA) are outside the scope of this guideline.**",periop,target_population_extraction
PMC6135479.txt,"This SASM guideline is **intended for intraoperative management of adult (≥18 years) surgical/procedural patients with known or suspected obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)**. Patients “cannot use” (i.e., the guideline is **not applicable / not developed for**) the following groups or situations:

## 1) Patient populations explicitly not covered (clinical scope exclusions)

### A. Children / adolescents
- **Anyone <18 years old** (the evidence review and recommendations are for adults only).

### B. Sleep-disordered breathing that is *not* OSA
The task force states they **did not consider** patients with sleep-disordered breathing *unrelated to OSA*, specifically including:
- **Hypoventilation syndromes** (e.g., non-OSA hypoventilation disorders)
- **Periodic breathing**
- **Central apnea unrelated to OSA**

So, if the primary disorder is **central sleep apnea** (not OSA) or another non-OSA breathing disorder, this guideline should not be used as the main guidance.

### C. (Practical implication) Patients whose main perioperative issue is outside “intraoperative management”
This document is specifically about **intraoperative** issues (airway, anesthetic drugs, anesthesia technique). It is **not** a comprehensive guideline for:
- Preoperative diagnosis/long-term sleep medicine management
- Postoperative disposition/monitoring pathways (except where intraoperative choices affect postop risk)

## 2) Evidence-base exclusions (what was excluded from the literature, which limits applicability)

These are not “patients banned from care,” but they define **who the recommendations are least reliable for**, because the underlying studies were excluded:

### A. Non–English-language evidence base
- The systematic review included **English-language studies only**, so applicability may be weaker in settings where key evidence exists in other languages.

### B. Chronic use of intraoperative-type medications (not acute perioperative dosing)
- Studies about **chronic use** of medications commonly used intraoperatively—explicitly mentioned: **chronic opioid medication**—were excluded.
  - Therefore, patients on **long-term opioids** (and by extension other chronically used sedatives/analgesics) are not well represented in the evidence the guideline is built on.

### C. Situations where outcomes weren’t reported in studies
- Studies **without outcome reporting** were excluded, limiting evidence for some subgroups/settings where only descriptive data exist.

### D. For the “anesthesia technique” question (regional vs general)
- For that section (Group 3), studies **not directly comparing anesthesia modalities** were excluded.
  - So if a patient/procedure context is mainly informed by non-comparative data, the guideline’s technique recommendation may be less directly supported.

## 3) Settings/patients where the guideline may be inappropriate even if they have OSA (explicit caution)
The guideline repeatedly emphasizes it:
- **“may not be suitable for all clinical settings and patients”**
- is **not a standard of care** and requires **individualized assessment** based on patient factors and resources.

So even in adults with OSA, it may not be appropriate to apply rigidly in:
- Resource-limited environments (e.g., limited airway rescue tools/monitoring/CPAP availability)
- Highly atypical comorbidity profiles where OSA is not the dominant risk driver

If you tell me the specific patient type you’re thinking about (e.g., **obesity hypoventilation syndrome**, **central sleep apnea**, **pediatric tonsillectomy**, **adult on chronic opioids**, etc.), I can map them to “covered vs not covered” and explain what alternative guidance is usually used.",periop,exclusion_criteria_extraction
PMC11161250.txt,"## TARGET POPULATION (extracted from the provided guideline text)

### Primary target population (core scope)
**Patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) who have either:**
- **Borderline-resectable PDAC (BR-PDAC)**, or
- **Locally advanced PDAC (LA-PDAC)**

**Context of care addressed:** the guideline is specifically about **perioperative care and surgical management** (including pancreatectomy with vascular resection) for these patients.

**Key scope statement from the text (substance preserved):**
- The guideline provides “**clinical recommendations pertaining to pancreatectomy with vascular resection for patients with BR-PDAC and LA-PDAC**.”

---

## Target population segmentation (with significant details)

### 1) Patients with **Borderline-Resectable PDAC (BR-PDAC)**
These guidelines target patients with **BR-PDAC** in whom surgery is considered the **intended end-goal** after multimodality therapy.

**Important details/selection expectations described:**
- **Preoperative systemic therapy**: “**should be delivered to all patients** with or without radiation.”
- **Surgery as end-goal**: “**Surgery remains the treatment end-goal option for BR-PDAC**…”
- **Operative setting expectations**: surgery should be performed by **skilled pancreatic surgeons**, ideally in **high-volume centers/centers of excellence**, with capability for **vascular resection/reconstruction**.

**Implication:** BR-PDAC patients are within scope broadly, but the guideline emphasizes modern practice where **neoadjuvant therapy precedes surgery** and where teams must be prepared for **vascular involvement** and potential reconstruction.

---

### 2) Patients with **Locally Advanced PDAC (LA-PDAC)** (selected subgroup)
The guideline also targets **LA-PDAC**, but repeatedly emphasizes that surgery is **not for all LA-PDAC**—only **well-selected** patients.

**Selection criteria/significant details explicitly mentioned:**
- Surgery “**should be taken into consideration also in well-selected patients with LA-PDAC** using stringent criteria including:
  - **tumor regression/stability**
  - **a significant decline in CA 19-9 levels**
  - **limited to patients fit for surgery**”
- The guideline highlights a shift toward **“prognosis-based resectability”** (biologic behavior emphasized over anatomy alone; referenced as an **A–B–C approach**).

**Implication:** LA-PDAC is in scope, but the target population is effectively **LA-PDAC patients who respond favorably to neoadjuvant therapy and remain good surgical candidates**.

---

### 3) Patients with **vascular involvement requiring complex surgery** (a major focus within BR/LA PDAC)
A major portion of the guideline’s target population is BR/LA PDAC patients for whom surgery may involve:
- **Portal vein resection**
- Potentially **arterial procedures** (more restricted; see below)
- **Vascular resection and reconstruction** planning and execution

**Key details:**
- Surgeons must be prepared for “**unplanned vein or artery resection and reconstruction during surgery**.”
- Vascular resections may be performed by vascular/transplant surgeons, but the guideline notes that pancreatic surgeons should develop “**proficiency and independence in vascular resection and reconstruction**” due to availability constraints.

---

### 4) Highly selected patients considered for **arterial resection** (narrow, restricted subgroup)
The guideline discusses arterial resection as **high-risk** and **not routine**, but still within scope for a **very select** target population.

**Who this applies to (as described):**
- “The REDISCOVER guidelines permit the prudent pursuit of arterial resections in **highly selected patients**…”
- Specifically: patients with involvement of the **celiac trunk and/or hepatic artery**, **but not** the **superior mesenteric artery (SMA)**.
- Must be:
  - Operated on by **skilled pancreatic surgeons**
  - In **centers of excellence**
  - With a **multidisciplinary tumor board** decision to proceed
  - With outcomes **documented in a prospective database/registry** (REDISCOVER registry)

**Implication:** This is a clearly defined *subset* of the broader BR/LA PDAC population.

---

### 5) Patients with **uncommon scenarios** mentioned as potentially considered (e.g., oligometastatic disease) — contextual, not fully endorsed
The text notes practice variation and that some experts would consider surgery even in scenarios like:
- **Oligometastatic liver metastases** (mentioned as something “around one-third” of experts would accept resection for)

**However:** the provided text frames this as part of discussion/survey variation rather than a standard recommended target group. It signals that the guideline is engaging with these edge cases, but it does **not** clearly define them as routine target population.

---

### 6) Patients without tissue diagnosis after repeated attempts (selected subgroup for treatment initiation)
The guideline introduces a practical scenario relevant to the target population:

**Subset described:**
- Patients with an “**evident clinical and radiologic presentation for PDAC**”
- Who are “**well-informed**”
- Where “**at least 2 biopsies failed**” to obtain diagnosis

**What the guideline suggests for this subset:**
- “**Starting neoadjuvant chemotherapy should be considered without the need for pretreatment tissue diagnosis**” in this selected group (noting this differs from strict NCCN/ESMO requirements but aligns with their exception pathways via MDTB at high-volume centers).

**Implication:** This defines an additional *clinical-entry* subgroup within BR/LA PDAC pathways.

---

## Consolidated “TARGET POPULATION” statement (ready-to-use)
**Adult patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) classified as borderline-resectable (BR-PDAC) or locally advanced (LA-PDAC), particularly those managed with neoadjuvant systemic therapy (± radiation) with surgery as an intended end-goal, including patients requiring pancreatectomy with venous resection and, in highly selected cases, arterial procedures (celiac trunk/hepatic artery involvement but not SMA), treated in high-volume/center-of-excellence settings with multidisciplinary tumor board oversight and prospective outcomes documentation.**

---

If you upload the actual PDF/figure version of the guideline (or provide the link/citation), I can extract the **exact “Target population” section verbatim** (if it exists as a labeled heading) and reconcile it against the narrative statements above.",periop,target_population_extraction
PMC11161250.txt,"These REDISCOVER guidelines are **not meant for “all pancreatic cancer patients”**. They specifically address **perioperative surgical care** for a narrow group: patients with **pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)** who are **borderline‑resectable (BR)** or **locally advanced (LA)** and are being considered for **pancreatectomy with (possible) vascular resection/reconstruction**, typically **after neoadjuvant therapy**, in **high‑expertise settings**.

So, patients who “cannot use this guideline” (i.e., are outside its intended scope or are generally not appropriate candidates for the pathway it describes) fall into these main exclusion categories:

## 1) Patients who do not have the target disease
- **Non‑PDAC tumors** (e.g., pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, ampullary cancer, distal cholangiocarcinoma, metastases to pancreas, cystic neoplasms).
- **Benign/inflammatory disease** mimicking cancer (e.g., autoimmune pancreatitis) unless PDAC is the working diagnosis agreed by an expert MDT (see also tissue diagnosis note below).

## 2) Patients who are not in the target stage group (not BR‑PDAC or LA‑PDAC)
- **Clearly resectable PDAC** (standard upfront surgery pathways are covered by other guidelines).
- **Widely metastatic PDAC** (systemic/palliative intent rather than perioperative vascular pancreatectomy pathways).

### Important nuance: “oligometastatic” disease
The document notes that some experts sometimes consider resection in *uncommon scenarios* (e.g., limited liver metastases), but this is **not routine** and is **highly selected/exceptional**. In practice, most patients with metastatic disease are **outside** the guideline’s core intended population.

## 3) Patients who are not candidates for surgery (functional/medical exclusion)
Even if anatomy suggests BR/LA, the guideline repeatedly emphasizes **stringent selection** and “fit for surgery.” Patients generally excluded from following this surgical-perioperative guideline include those with:
- **Poor performance status/frailty** such that major pancreatectomy ± vascular reconstruction is unsafe.
- **Prohibitive comorbidity** (e.g., severe cardiopulmonary disease, uncontrolled infection, decompensated cirrhosis, etc.).
- **Inability to tolerate neoadjuvant therapy** when it is indicated as part of the modern pathway (the guideline states preoperative systemic therapy should be delivered to all, with/without radiation).

## 4) Patients with unfavorable biology or lack of response to neoadjuvant therapy
REDISCOVER adopts the modern concept that resectability is not purely anatomic; it also depends on **tumor biology and treatment response**. Patients generally *not* appropriate for the guideline’s operative pathway include those with:
- **Progression on neoadjuvant therapy** (radiologic progression or clear clinical deterioration).
- **No meaningful biologic response**, highlighted by the guideline as selection criteria such as:
  - lack of **tumor regression/stability**, and/or
  - lack of **significant CA19‑9 decline** (when CA19‑9 is interpretable).
- Any scenario where the MDT judges the disease behavior suggests **systemic spread risk outweighs benefit** of aggressive surgery.

## 5) Patients with arterial involvement patterns the guideline does *not* support for surgery
A key explicit limitation in the text is that REDISCOVER:
- **Does not generally advocate arterial resections in routine practice**, because of morbidity/mortality and learning-curve issues.
- Allows arterial resection only in **highly selected** cases and **notably excludes** certain patterns.

Most importantly, the guideline states surgery may be considered when arterial involvement is limited to:
- **celiac trunk and/or hepatic artery** involvement (in selected cases)

But it **does not accept surgery as an option when arterial involvement includes**:
- **superior mesenteric artery (SMA) involvement** (this is the clearest anatomic “exclusion” described in the discussion).

So, **LA‑PDAC with SMA encasement/involvement** is generally **outside** the recommended surgical pathway.

## 6) Patients treated in settings that cannot meet the required expertise/infrastructure
The guideline strongly ties these operations to:
- **High‑volume centers / “centers of excellence”**
- Teams with **vascular reconstruction capability** (pancreatic surgeons proficient/independent, or reliable access to vascular/transplant surgeons)
- **Multidisciplinary tumor board** decision-making
- Prospective data capture/registry participation (strongly encouraged)

Therefore, patients are effectively “excluded” from *appropriate use* of this guideline if care is being delivered in a setting that lacks:
- adequate pancreatic surgery volume/experience,
- ability to perform/plan vascular resections safely,
- MDT review,
- perioperative resources to manage complications of complex vascular pancreatectomy.

## 7) Situations where the guideline is not intended to override oncology standards
REDISCOVER explicitly says it is **not intended to supersede** established oncology guidelines (NCCN/ESMO, etc.). So patients whose management question is primarily:
- systemic therapy selection,
- radiation indications/dose/fractionation,
- metastatic disease systemic strategies,
are **not** the main target of this document.

## 8) Tissue diagnosis caveat (not a strict exclusion, but a boundary condition)
Many pathways require histologic confirmation before neoadjuvant therapy. REDISCOVER discusses an exception:
- If PDAC is clinically/radiologically evident, MDT agrees, and **≥2 biopsy attempts failed**, neoadjuvant therapy *may* start without tissue.

So **lack of tissue diagnosis is not automatically an exclusion**—but only under strict conditions and expert MDT agreement.

PMC5323492.txt,"This ESICM guideline is written for **adult critically ill ICU patients** in whom enteral nutrition (EN) is being considered within the first 48 hours. Patients who “cannot use” (i.e., should *not* receive early EN per this guideline, or in whom EN should be *delayed*) fall into two practical categories:

1) **Outside the guideline’s intended population (scope exclusions)**  
2) **Within-scope patients, but with conditions where the guideline recommends *delaying* EN (clinical exclusions/contraindications to early EN)**

---

## 1) Scope exclusions (not the target population)
These guidelines are explicitly about **adult** critically ill patients.

So they do **not** apply (or are not directly validated) to:
- **Children/neonates** (paediatric critical care)
- **Non–critically ill** hospitalized patients (ward patients, elective non-ICU pathways)
- **Patients able to eat adequately by mouth** (the guideline is about patients “unable to eat”/needing artificial nutrition)
- Situations where the decision is not about EN timing (e.g., long-term outpatient tube feeding)

(Also, the evidence base is ICU-focused; applying it to other settings would be extrapolation.)

---

## 2) Within-scope patients in whom *early* EN should be delayed (the main “exclusion criteria” in practice)
The guideline’s conclusion and recommendations specify conditions where EN is commonly unsafe or poorly tolerated and should be **withheld initially** (i.e., *do not start early EN yet*). These are the key exclusion/deferral situations:

### A. Uncontrolled shock / inadequate perfusion
- **Uncontrolled shock** where **haemodynamic and tissue perfusion goals are not reached** (despite fluids and vasopressors/inotropes).  
  *Rationale:* risk of worsening splanchnic hypoperfusion and rare but catastrophic bowel ischemia/NOMI.  
  *When EN becomes acceptable:* once shock is **controlled**, start **low-dose EN**.

### B. Uncontrolled, life-threatening respiratory/metabolic derangements
- **Uncontrolled life‑threatening hypoxaemia**
- **Uncontrolled life‑threatening hypercapnia**
- **Uncontrolled life‑threatening acidosis**  
  *When EN becomes acceptable:* if hypoxaemia is stable and hypercapnia/acidosis are compensated/permissive.

### C. Active/uncontrolled upper GI bleeding
- **Active upper GI bleeding** (or “uncontrolled” bleeding)  
  *When EN becomes acceptable:* after bleeding has **stopped** and there are **no signs of rebleeding**.

### D. High gastric aspirate (gastric residual) suggesting intolerance
- **Gastric aspirate volume > 500 mL over 6 hours**  
  *Action:* delay EN (or hold/adjust if already started), address intolerance (often prokinetics/post‑pyloric feeding are considered elsewhere in the document).

### E. Intestinal conditions where feeding may be dangerous
- **Overt bowel ischaemia** (occlusive or non-occlusive)  
- **Bowel obstruction / mechanical ileus**  
  *These are classic contraindications because EN can worsen distension/ischemia or cannot pass.*

### F. Abdominal compartment syndrome
- **Abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS)**  
  (The guideline distinguishes intra-abdominal hypertension vs ACS; the explicit “delay EN” recommendation is for **ACS**.)

### G. High-output intestinal fistula without distal access
- **High-output intestinal fistula** **if reliable feeding access distal to the fistula is not achievable**  
  *Reason:* EN may markedly increase fistula output, causing fluid/electrolyte derangements and skin breakdown.  
  *If distal access exists:* EN may still be possible.

---

## Important clarification: conditions that are *not* exclusion criteria by themselves
The guideline specifically suggests **not delaying EN solely** because of:
- **Neuromuscular blocking agents**
- **Prone positioning**
- **ECMO**
- **Therapeutic hypothermia** (start low-dose, increase after rewarming)
- **Absent bowel sounds** (unless ischemia/obstruction suspected)
- Neurologic injury diagnoses like **TBI, stroke, spinal cord injury** (EEN generally suggested)

---

### Bottom line list (the “do not start early EN” group per ESICM)
Per the guideline’s conclusion, **delay EN** in critically ill adults with:
1. **Uncontrolled shock** (perfusion goals not met)  
2. **Uncontrolled life-threatening hypoxaemia/hypercapnia/acidosis**  
3. **Active/uncontrolled upper GI bleeding**  
4. **Overt bowel ischaemia**  
5. **Bowel obstruction (mechanical ileus)**  
6. **Abdominal compartment syndrome**  
7. **Gastric aspirate > 500 mL/6 h**  
8. **High-output fistula** when **no distal feeding access** is possible

If you tell me the patient scenario (diagnosis, haemodynamics/vasopressors, lactate/perfusion, GI status), I can map it to these criteria and summarize whether the guideline would support EEN, low-dose/trophic EN, post-pyloric feeding, or delaying EN.",periop,exclusion_criteria_extraction
PMC11427556.txt,"## TARGET POPULATION (extracted from the guideline text)

### Primary target population (overall scope)
**Adults undergoing non-cardiac surgery (perioperative/intraoperative setting).**  
- The guideline is explicitly titled **“Intraoperative haemodynamic monitoring and management of adults having non-cardiac surgery.”**  
- The recommendations are framed for **perioperative care during surgery** (i.e., intraoperative monitoring/management), with repeated references to **patients under general anaesthesia** and **elective non-cardiac surgery**.

**Key inclusion characteristics stated or clearly implied in the text**
- **Age:** **Adults** (not pediatric patients).
- **Procedure type:** **Non-cardiac surgery** (not cardiac surgery).
- **Care phase:** **Intraoperative** (with some statements touching perioperative context, e.g., hypotension after induction; but the guideline focus is intraoperative monitoring/management).
- **Anaesthesia context:** Includes patients **under general anaesthesia** (explicitly mentioned for oscillometric BP measurement frequency), and more broadly those receiving anaesthesia for non-cardiac surgery.

**Key exclusions / out-of-scope (implied by scope statement)**
- **Children/pediatric patients** (not addressed; scope is “adults”).
- **Cardiac surgery patients** (scope is “non-cardiac surgery”).

---

## TARGET POPULATION SEGMENTS (with significant details from the recommendations)

### 1) Adults under general anaesthesia requiring intermittent (oscillometric) BP monitoring
This subgroup is explicitly referenced in the oscillometric BP section.
- **Population:** Patients **under general anaesthesia** in whom **non-invasive oscillometric arterial pressure monitoring** is used.
- **Operational details tied to this population:**
  - BP cuff should be on the **upper arm** (if possible), correct cuff size, positioned at **heart level**.
  - **Measurement interval:** In patients under general anaesthesia, oscillometric BP **ought to be performed every 3 minutes**, adapted to clinical context.

---

### 2) Adults at risk of BP-related complications who should receive continuous arterial pressure monitoring
- **Population definition (as written):** Continuous arterial pressure monitoring should be used in patients who—**because of anaesthesiologic or surgical procedures or concomitant diseases—are at risk for complications associated with hypotension or hypertension.**
- **Monitoring modality details:**
  - Continuous monitoring **ought** to be performed with an **arterial catheter** (reference approach).
  - In **low or moderate risk** patients, **non-invasive continuous** arterial pressure monitoring **may be considered** (but is stated as not interchangeable with intraarterial measurements).

---

### 3) Adults with an indication for intraarterial arterial pressure monitoring (arterial line) around induction
- **Population:** Patients who have an **indication for intraarterial arterial pressure monitoring**.
- **Key timing detail:** The arterial catheter **should be inserted before induction of anaesthesia**, because hypotension after induction is common and associated with postoperative organ injury.

---

### 4) Adults undergoing surgery in positions where cerebral perfusion pressure may differ from arm/heart-level pressure
- **Population:** Surgical patients in positions where the **right atrium reference level is lower than the cranial base** (i.e., head elevated relative to heart).
- **Key management implications:**
  - During **position changes**, arterial pressure should be measured **closely or continuously**.
  - **MAP should be corrected** for hydrostatic differences (if measured non-invasively) or the reference level for continuous monitoring should be set at the **cranial base** to reflect pressure in the circle of Willis.

---

### 5) High-risk adults in whom stroke volume/cardiac output monitoring may be considered
- **Population:** Patients with a **high risk for complications** (patient-related and/or surgery-related risk).
- **Key details:**
  - Stroke volume/cardiac output monitoring **may be considered** in these high-risk patients.
  - Targets should be **individualized**, interpreted with clinical/metabolic signs of hypoperfusion, and **not routinely maximized**.

---

### 6) Mechanically ventilated adults (specific conditions) for dynamic fluid responsiveness assessment
- **Population:** **Mechanically ventilated** patients where dynamic preload variables can be applied.
- **Key details/criteria stated:**
  - Use **dynamic preload variables** (e.g., **PPV/SVV**) in mechanically ventilated patients.
  - PPV/SVV prediction is described for patients with **tidal volumes ≥ 8 ml/kg** and **sinus rhythm**.
  - If dynamic variables cannot be used, perform **stroke volume/cardiac output-based fluid challenge tests**.
  - **Static preload variables** (e.g., **CVP**) should **not** be used to assess fluid responsiveness.

---

### 7) Adults with haemodynamic instability not responding to initial treatment (unclear cause) — echocardiography subgroup
- **Population:** Patients with **haemodynamic instability not responding to initial treatment**, especially when the **cause is unclear**.
- **Key details:**
  - **Echocardiography should be performed** in this scenario.
  - Echo **may be considered** to guide haemodynamic therapy.
  - Images/results should be **saved** in the medical record.
  - Echo (especially **TEE**) should be performed by **experienced examiners**.

---

### 8) Adults with suspected hypoperfusion / inadequate tissue oxygenation — lactate and ScvO₂ subgroups
- **Population:** Patients in whom **hypoperfusion or inadequate tissue oxygenation are suspected**.
- **Key details:**
  - **Lactate should be measured**; elevated lactate should be interpreted with possible non-haemodynamic causes.
  - **Central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO₂) may be used** for additional assessment.

---

## Consolidated “TARGET POPULATION” statement (ready to paste)
**Adult patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery in the intraoperative/perioperative setting, including patients under general anaesthesia, particularly those at increased risk of haemodynamic complications (e.g., hypotension/hypertension, high-risk surgery or comorbid disease) who may require continuous arterial pressure monitoring and/or advanced haemodynamic assessment (cardiac output/stroke volume monitoring, echocardiography, lactate/ScvO₂ assessment). Pediatric patients and cardiac surgery patients are outside the scope.**",periop,target_population_extraction
PMC11427556.txt,"These DGAI guidelines are explicitly **not meant to be applied to every surgical patient group**. Their “exclusion criteria” are mainly defined by the **population and setting named in the title/scope** (“adults”, “intraoperative”, “non‑cardiac surgery”). So, patients fall outside the guideline if they do not match that scope, or if they are in a clinical context where separate, more specific guidance is typically required.

## 1) Age group excluded
### Children and adolescents
- **All paediatric patients** (neonates, infants, children, adolescents) are **excluded**, because the guideline is for **adults** only.
- Reason: haemodynamic physiology, normal ranges, monitoring technology performance, and evidence base differ substantially in paediatrics.

## 2) Type of surgery excluded
### Cardiac surgery patients
- Patients undergoing **cardiac surgery** are **excluded** (e.g., CABG, valve surgery, aortic surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass, etc.).
- Reason: cardiac surgery has distinct haemodynamic goals, monitoring standards (e.g., routine TEE in many centres), and evidence; dedicated cardiac-anaesthesia guidelines apply.

### (Often also treated as “out of scope”): procedures with cardiac-surgery–like physiology
The guideline is titled “non-cardiac surgery,” so cases that are not “cardiac surgery” but have **very specific haemodynamic frameworks** are commonly considered outside the intended target group unless the team deliberately chooses to extrapolate:
- **Heart or lung transplantation**
- **Major mechanical circulatory support procedures** (e.g., LVAD implantation)
- **ECMO cannulation/management as the primary procedure**
These are not always explicitly listed as exclusions in short summaries, but they are typically managed under specialty protocols rather than general non-cardiac guidance.

## 3) Perioperative phase excluded
### Not intended for preoperative or postoperative/ICU-only management
- The scope is **intraoperative** monitoring/management.
- So patients are “excluded” if the question is about:
  - **Preoperative optimisation** (clinic/ward/ED resuscitation strategies)
  - **Post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU)** management
  - **ICU haemodynamic management** beyond the operating room phase  
(Clinicians may still extrapolate principles, but that is outside the guideline’s defined remit.)

## 4) Anaesthesia/surgical context not covered (practical “cannot use as written” situations)
These are not “patient exclusions” by diagnosis, but they are situations where **key recommendations may not be applicable as written**, so the guideline cannot be followed literally for that patient:

### When dynamic indices of fluid responsiveness are invalid
The guideline recommends PPV/SVV **in mechanically ventilated patients** under certain conditions. Therefore, patients in whom these conditions are not met cannot be managed using those specific tests:
- **Spontaneous breathing** (no controlled ventilation)
- **Low tidal volume ventilation** (commonly < 8 ml/kg as stated in the text)
- **Cardiac arrhythmias** (especially **atrial fibrillation**)
- **Open chest**, very low lung compliance, high PEEP, right heart failure, etc. (classic limitations of PPV/SVV)

In such patients, the guideline itself redirects you to alternatives (e.g., **stroke volume/cardiac output–based fluid challenge**), but it means the “PPV/SVV approach” is not usable.

### When echocardiography is not feasible/contraindicated
The guideline supports intraoperative echo (TTE/TEE) in instability. Some patients cannot undergo certain echo modalities:
- **TEE contraindications** (e.g., oesophageal stricture, recent oesophageal surgery, active upper GI bleeding, some varices—depending on severity and local policy)
- **TTE not feasible** due to surgical field/draping/body habitus/positioning  
So the “echo-guided” pathway may not be usable for that patient in that moment.

## 5) What is *not* an exclusion
Importantly, the guideline is **not limited to “healthy” adults**. It is intended to include adults with comorbidities having non-cardiac surgery, including high-risk patients—indeed, many recommendations (continuous BP monitoring, CO monitoring “may be considered” in high-risk patients, echo in instability) are aimed at higher-risk groups.

If you want, tell me the **patient group or procedure** you’re thinking about (e.g., C-section, trauma, neurosurgery sitting position, vascular surgery, severe aortic stenosis, AF with low tidal volume ventilation), and I can map precisely which parts of the guideline apply and which parts effectively become “not usable” for that scenario.",periop,exclusion_criteria_extraction
PMC4956681.txt,"## TARGET POPULATION (extracted from the guideline text)

### Overall scope / who the guideline applies to
- **Adult surgical patients (≥18 years)** in the **preoperative** setting.
- Patients **scheduled for elective surgery**.
- Focus is on **preoperative screening and preparation** for **obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)**, including **perioperative use of CPAP/PAP** (pre- and post-op).

**Direct scope statement (from “Aims” / “METHODS”):**
- The guideline “focuses on the **preoperative screening and preparation of adult surgical patients scheduled for elective surgery**, including implementation of **CPAP therapy in the preoperative and postoperative period**.”
- Literature search and evidence base were restricted to **adults (18 years of age and older)**.

### Populations explicitly NOT covered / outside scope
- **Sleep-disordered breathing unrelated to OSA** is excluded:
  - “Patients affected by sleep-disordered breathing unrelated to OSA were not considered…”
  - Examples listed: **hypoventilation syndromes**, **periodic breathing**, and **central sleep apnea unrelated to OSA**.

---

## Target populations segmented as the guideline’s 3 clinically relevant groups

The guideline explicitly states it categorizes patients into **3 clinically relevant groups** for recommendations:

### 1) Diagnosed OSA, treated (adherent to PAP)
**Who this includes**
- Adult elective surgical patients with a **known diagnosis of OSA** who are **using PAP therapy** (e.g., CPAP/APAP/BiPAP) as prescribed (adherent/treated).

**Important details the guideline adds**
- The perioperative team should know the patient has OSA and whether they use PAP or alternative therapy at home.
- Patients treated with **non-PAP alternatives** (e.g., oral appliance, nasal resistive valves, prior OSA surgery) **without follow-up sleep testing confirming control/resolution** should be treated as **high probability of untreated OSA** (i.e., not confidently “treated/controlled”).

### 2) Diagnosed OSA, partially treated / untreated (nonadherent or declines PAP)
**Who this includes**
- Adult elective surgical patients with a **known diagnosis of OSA** who:
  - **refuse** PAP, or
  - are **poorly adherent / nonadherent**, or
  - are otherwise **untreated**.

**Important details the guideline adds (risk modifiers)**
- The guideline highlights a subset where **additional preoperative cardiopulmonary evaluation/optimization** should be considered when there is evidence of **uncontrolled systemic disease** or **ventilation/gas-exchange problems**, including (not limited to):
  1) **Hypoventilation syndromes**
  2) **Severe pulmonary hypertension**
  3) **Resting hypoxemia not attributable to other cardiopulmonary disease**

### 3) Suspected OSA / high probability of OSA (screen-positive)
**Who this includes**
- Adult elective surgical patients **not formally diagnosed** with OSA but identified preoperatively as having a **high probability / high risk** of OSA based on screening/clinical assessment.

**Important details the guideline adds**
- The guideline supports identifying “adult patients at risk for OSA” before surgery and using screening tools (e.g., **STOP-Bang**, **P-SAP**, **Berlin**, **ASA checklist**) to identify suspected OSA.
- It emphasizes that screening tools are **not diagnostic** and can **overdiagnose**; therefore, patients found high-risk should be advised to notify their **primary medical provider** for possible referral and definitive evaluation.

---

## Additional population notes explicitly mentioned in the guideline (subgroups discussed)

These are not framed as separate “target populations” headings, but the guideline explicitly discusses them as important subpopulations within the overall adult elective surgical population:

### A) Morbidly obese surgical patients (higher OSA prevalence/risk)
- Discussed as a group where identifying OSA risk may be particularly useful.
- Notes include:
  - **BMI ≥40 kg/m²**: high OSA prevalence; increased postoperative morbidity/mortality; risk increases further with OSA.
  - STOP-Bang is noted as validated in obese/morbidly obese surgical patients.

### B) Obstetric patients (mentioned, but note: not the main target because guideline is adult elective surgery broadly)
- The guideline discusses obstetric patients as a population where OSA identification may be useful due to maternal/fetal/perioperative risks.
- It also notes screening tools are **less accurate** and not validated in obstetrics, and there are **no pregnancy-specific guidelines**; it suggests extrapolating approaches used for other diagnosed/suspected OSA patients.

*(If you want, I can present these as “secondary target populations/subgroups” vs. the 3 primary groups above.)*",periop,target_population_extraction
PMC4956681.txt,"This SASM guideline is **not meant to be applied to every “sleep-disordered breathing” patient or every surgical scenario**. Its scope is fairly specific (adult, elective surgery, OSA), and it explicitly excludes (or does not address) several patient groups and situations.

## 1) Patients excluded by age / population
### A. Children and adolescents
- The literature search and recommendations are restricted to **adults ≥18 years**.
- Therefore, **pediatric OSA** (which differs in anatomy, causes, and perioperative risk profile) is outside the guideline.

### B. Non‑English evidence base (methodologic limitation)
- Not a “patient exclusion” per se, but the evidence used to build the guideline was limited to **English-language adult studies**, which can limit applicability in some populations/settings.

## 2) Patients excluded because their sleep-breathing disorder is *not OSA*
The guideline states it **does not consider sleep-disordered breathing unrelated to obstructive sleep apnea**, because evidence was insufficient to make perioperative recommendations for these disorders. Examples explicitly listed:

### A. Hypoventilation syndromes (as a primary disorder)
- e.g., **obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS)** as the main diagnosis, or other chronic hypoventilation disorders.

### B. Central sleep apnea (CSA) unrelated to OSA
- e.g., idiopathic CSA, CSA due to neurologic disease, medication-related CSA, etc. (when not part of an obstructive phenotype).

### C. Periodic breathing / Cheyne–Stokes respiration
- Often seen with heart failure or neurologic disease; not addressed as a primary target condition.

**Important nuance:** The guideline *does* repeatedly mention hypoventilation, severe pulmonary hypertension, and resting hypoxemia as “red flags” that may warrant **additional evaluation and optimization** in patients with known/suspected OSA—but it does **not** provide full management guidance for patients whose primary problem is a non-OSA breathing disorder.

## 3) Patients excluded by surgical context (scope limits)
### A. Non-elective (urgent/emergent) surgery
- The guideline’s stated aim is **adult patients scheduled for elective surgery**.
- In urgent/emergent cases, the timing/feasibility assumptions (screening, optimization, PAP planning) often do not hold, so the guideline is not designed for that context.

### B. Upper airway surgery (in the CPAP evidence/recommendations)
For the section evaluating **perioperative CPAP**, the evidence review excluded studies that:
- involved **upper airway surgery** (e.g., many OSA surgeries, ENT airway procedures), because CPAP use/outcomes are not comparable and may be contraindicated or managed differently.

So, while the guideline overall discusses surgical patients broadly, its **CPAP effectiveness conclusions** are **not based on upper-airway-surgery populations**.

## 4) “Cannot use” in the sense of *not appropriate to proceed without extra workup*
This is not an exclusion from the guideline, but it is the main group where the guideline suggests the usual “don’t delay surgery for sleep testing” approach may **not** apply.

The guideline recommends **considering additional cardiopulmonary evaluation/optimization** (and potentially delaying for workup depending on context) when a patient with known or suspected OSA has evidence suggesting **disturbed ventilation or gas exchange**, specifically:
- **Clinically significant hypoventilation** (including suspected OHS)
- **Severe pulmonary hypertension**
- **Resting hypoxemia not attributable to other diagnosed cardiopulmonary disease**

In practice, these are the patients for whom applying a “routine OSA pathway” without further evaluation may be inappropriate.

## 5) Exclusions that apply to the *evidence included*, not necessarily the bedside guideline
In the METHODS section, the authors also excluded certain **study types** (e.g., no control group, no outcomes reported, no screening data, etc.). Those are **research exclusions**, not direct “patient cannot use the guideline” exclusions—but they explain why evidence may be thin for some subgroups.

---

If you tell me the patient type you’re thinking about (e.g., pregnancy, bariatric surgery, COPD overlap, OHS, emergent surgery, ENT surgery), I can map that scenario to whether it’s **in-scope**, **partially addressed**, or **out-of-scope** under this guideline.",periop,exclusion_criteria_extraction
PMC11885194.txt,"## TARGET POPULATION (extracted from the guideline text provided)

This consensus statement applies to **adults in the peri‑operative period** who are **taking any of the following drug classes** and are undergoing a **procedure involving sedation or general anaesthesia** (and, more broadly, peri‑operative care):

- **Glucagon‑like peptide‑1 receptor agonists (GLP‑1 RAs)**  
- **Dual glucose‑dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) / GLP‑1 receptor agonists**  
- **Sodium‑glucose cotransporter‑2 (SGLT2) inhibitors**

The guideline is written for peri‑operative management because these drugs may be associated with:
- **Pulmonary aspiration risk** (particularly discussed for GLP‑1 RA / GIP‑GLP‑1 agents due to delayed gastric emptying)
- **(Euglycaemic) ketoacidosis risk** (particularly discussed for SGLT2 inhibitors)

It also explicitly includes adults taking these drugs **with or without diabetes mellitus**, because:
- GLP‑1 RAs are increasingly used for **obesity** (and other emerging indications)
- SGLT2 inhibitors are licensed/used for **heart failure** and **chronic kidney disease** in people **without diabetes**

---

## Segmented target populations (with significant details)

### 1) Adults taking GLP‑1 receptor agonists or dual GIP/GLP‑1 receptor agonists (peri‑operative setting)
**Who is included**
- **Adult patients** taking **GLP‑1 RAs** (examples named: **liraglutide, semaglutide, dulaglutide**) or **dual GIP/GLP‑1 receptor agonists**
- Presenting for **elective procedures** requiring **sedation or general anaesthesia** (the aspiration discussion is framed around these settings), and peri‑operative care more generally

**Key clinical characteristics highlighted in the guideline (relevant to “who” this applies to)**
- Many such patients have **diabetes mellitus and/or obesity**
- The guideline notes that people taking GLP‑1 RAs often have **multiple aspiration risk factors**, because:
  - the **drug** may delay gastric emptying, and
  - the patient may also have **diabetes** and/or **obesity** (and sometimes additional risk factors)

**Peri‑operative risk focus for this population**
- **Delayed gastric emptying** and potential for **residual gastric contents despite fasting**
- Potential increased **pulmonary aspiration** risk during anaesthesia/sedation

---

### 2) Adults taking SGLT2 inhibitors (peri‑operative setting)
**Who is included**
- **Adult patients** taking **SGLT2 inhibitors** who are undergoing a **procedure** in the peri‑operative setting
- Includes patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors:
  - **for diabetes mellitus**, and also
  - **for heart failure or chronic kidney disease** **without diabetes mellitus**

**Peri‑operative risk focus for this population**
- **Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)** risk, especially **euglycaemic DKA** (ketoacidosis with **normal/near‑normal glucose**, described as glucose **< 11.0 mmol/L** in the text)
- Risk is discussed as applying to people **with or without diabetes mellitus**

**Additional subgroup explicitly called out**
- Patients with diabetes mellitus placed on a **very low energy / liver reduction diet** pre‑operatively (e.g., before some bariatric/laparoscopic procedures): the guideline gives specific medication‑stopping advice for SGLT2 inhibitors in this scenario.

---

## Cross-cutting target population statement (applies to all above groups)
- **All adult patients** taking these agents who are entering peri‑operative care should have:
  - **risk and mitigation strategies discussed** using **shared decision‑making**
  - attention to **fasting guidance** and avoidance of **prolonged starvation** (especially emphasized for SGLT2 inhibitors)

If you upload the full PDF (or images) of the guideline, I can extract the **exact “Target population” section verbatim** (if it exists as a labeled heading) and provide a cleaner, quote-based extraction.",periop,target_population_extraction
PMC11885194.txt,"This consensus statement is **not intended to be used for every patient or every peri‑operative scenario**. Its scope is quite specific, so the “exclusion criteria” are mostly **patients/procedures outside scope** (rather than “contraindications” to the drugs). Based on the title, methods and recommendations, the guideline **should not be applied (or should be applied only with specialist/alternative guidance)** in the following groups/situations:

## 1) Anyone who is not an adult
- The statement is explicitly for **adults**.  
- **Children/adolescents (<18 years)** are outside scope.

## 2) Non‑elective surgery / emergency pathways
- It is for **elective peri‑operative management**.  
- Therefore it does **not** cover:
  - **Emergency surgery**
  - **Urgent unplanned procedures**
  - Situations where there is **insufficient time** to follow the recommended pre‑operative medication adjustments (e.g., omitting SGLT2 inhibitors the day before).

## 3) Patients not taking the drug classes covered
It only addresses peri‑operative management for people taking:
- **GLP‑1 receptor agonists (GLP‑1 RAs)** (e.g., semaglutide, liraglutide, dulaglutide, etc.)
- **Dual GIP/GLP‑1 agonists** (e.g., tirzepatide)
- **SGLT2 inhibitors** (e.g., empagliflozin, dapagliflozin, canagliflozin, ertugliflozin)

So it is **not a general diabetes peri‑operative guideline** and should not be used as the main guide for:
- Insulin-only regimens
- Sulfonylureas, metformin, DPP‑4 inhibitors, etc. (except insofar as other guidelines cover them)

## 4) Patients undergoing non‑procedural “peri‑operative-like” fasting/illness scenarios
The recommendations are framed around **procedures requiring sedation/anaesthesia and peri‑operative care**. They are not designed to replace “sick day rules” or acute illness guidance in:
- Intercurrent illness without surgery
- Prolonged vomiting/poor intake at home
- Medical admissions not related to an operation/procedure

(They do mention sick‑day rules, but the document’s purpose is peri‑operative elective care.)

## 5) Situations where a different, more specific pathway should take precedence (highly specialised contexts)
The statement is deliberately “pragmatic” and acknowledges limited evidence. In practice, you should not treat it as sufficient on its own where **specialty‑specific protocols** exist and are more appropriate, for example:
- **Bariatric surgery pathways** (they specifically highlight liver‑reduction/very‑low‑energy diets and the need for tailored diabetes medication adjustment—especially stopping SGLT2 inhibitors at diet commencement)
- Pathways with mandated pre‑op diets or prolonged fasting where ketosis risk management is protocolised
- Institutions with established protocols for aspiration‑risk mitigation (e.g., routine gastric ultrasound in certain lists)

This isn’t “excluded” explicitly, but it’s a **clear limitation**: these patients often need **additional** guidance beyond this statement.

## 6) Patients in whom the key risks are already present (needs management as a condition, not just “follow the elective plan”)
The guideline is about *preventing* two main complications:
- **Aspiration risk** (GLP‑1/GIP‑GLP‑1 agents)
- **(Euglycaemic) ketoacidosis risk** (SGLT2 inhibitors)

So if a patient already has the complication or is suspected of it, you should not just apply the elective recommendations; you need acute management pathways instead, e.g.:
- Suspected/confirmed **diabetic ketoacidosis/euglycaemic DKA**
- Significant dehydration/starvation with ketonaemia
- Active severe GI pathology with vomiting/obstruction where aspiration risk is being managed as an acute problem

(Again: not written as “exclusion criteria,” but functionally these scenarios fall outside “elective management”.)

### Practical summary (who “cannot use” it)
You should consider this guideline **not applicable** if the patient is:
1) **<18 years**, or  
2) Having **emergency/urgent unplanned surgery**, or  
3) **Not taking** a GLP‑1 RA / dual GIP‑GLP‑1 agonist / SGLT2 inhibitor, or  
4) In an **acute illness/complication** scenario (e.g., suspected DKA) where acute protocols override elective peri‑op advice.

PMC5540357.txt,"## TARGET POPULATION (KDIGO 2017 Living Kidney Donor Guideline) — extracted text + key details

### Primary target population (who the guideline is for)
**Living kidney donor candidates and living kidney donors**, specifically:
- **“medical professionals who evaluate living kidney donor candidates and provide care before, during and after donation.”** (Abstract)
- The guideline repeatedly frames recommendations around **“donor candidates”** (people being evaluated for possible living donation) and **“donors”** (people who have already donated), including **predonation evaluation** and **postdonation follow-up**.

### Scope of care phases covered (what happens to the target population)
The guideline explicitly covers the full donation timeline for this population:
- **“provide care before, during and after donation”** (Abstract)
- **“The processes and framework for the donor candidate evaluation are presented, along with recommendations for optimal care before, during, and after donation.”** (Abstract)
- Postdonation: **“A personalized postdonation care plan should be provided before donation…”** and **annual postdonation monitoring** is recommended (Chapter 19).

---

## Segmented target populations within the guideline (subgroups explicitly addressed)

### 1) All living donor candidates (universal evaluation population)
This is the default population throughout:
- **“All donor candidates should be evaluated using the same criteria…”** (Rec 1.10)
- **“All donor candidates should be evaluated using the same criteria, regardless of whether donation is directed towards a designated recipient.”** (Rec 1.10)
- Includes both medical and psychosocial evaluation, informed consent, compatibility testing, surgical planning, infection/cancer screening, etc.

**Key inclusion concept:** anyone presenting for evaluation as a potential living kidney donor, regardless of relationship to recipient.

---

### 2) Nondirected donors (a specific target subgroup)
The guideline explicitly identifies **nondirected donor candidates** (donors without an identified recipient) as a subgroup needing counseling and policy disclosure:
- **“Nondirected donor candidates should be informed of availability, risks and benefits of participating in kidney paired donation.”** (Rec 3.6)
- **“Nondirected donors and donors participating in paired donation should be informed of the transplant program’s policy on contact with the recipient…”** (Rec 18.9)

---

### 3) Donor candidates in kidney paired donation (KPD) / incompatible pairs
Subgroup: donor candidates who are **ABO- or HLA-incompatible** with their intended recipient, and/or participating in KPD:
- **“Donor candidates who are ABO blood group or HLA incompatible with their intended recipient should be informed…”** (Rec 3.4)
- **“If a donor candidate and their intended recipient are blood type or crossmatch incompatible…”** (Rec 3.5)
- KPD participants are repeatedly referenced in counseling/policy sections (Chapters 3 and 18).

---

### 4) Female donor candidates, especially those with childbearing potential (pregnancy subgroup)
The guideline defines a clear subgroup and related exclusions/counseling:
- **“Female donor candidates should be asked about future childbearing plans.”** (Rec 15.1)
- **“Women should not donate while pregnant.”** (Rec 15.4)
- **“Women with childbearing potential…”** counseling on avoiding pregnancy around donation and possible increased risk of gestational HTN/preeclampsia (Rec 15.8–15.11)

---

### 5) Donor candidates with sub-Saharan African ancestry (APOL1 subgroup)
A genetically defined subgroup:
- **“APOL1 genotyping may be offered to donor candidates with sub-Saharan African ancestors.”** (Rec 14.8)
- Counseling includes that **2 APOL1 risk alleles increase lifetime kidney failure risk**, but **precise postdonation risk cannot currently be quantified** (Rec 14.8).

---

### 6) Donor candidates with specific medical findings/risk factors (selection subgroups)
The guideline repeatedly defines subgroups by evaluation findings and provides accept/individualize/exclude logic. Examples where the “target population” becomes “donor candidates with X”:

**Kidney function**
- **GFR ≥90** acceptable (Rec 5.6)
- **GFR 60–89** individualized (Rec 5.7)
- **GFR <60** should not donate (Rec 5.8)

**Albuminuria**
- **AER <30 mg/d** acceptable (Rec 6.4)
- **AER 30–100 mg/d** individualized (Rec 6.5)
- **AER >100 mg/d** should not donate (Rec 6.6)

**Hematuria**
- Persistent microscopic hematuria requires workup (Rec 7.2)
- **IgA nephropathy: “should not donate.”** (Rec 7.4)

**Hypertension**
- Controlled HTN (to <140/90 on 1–2 meds, no target organ damage) **may be acceptable** with individualized decision-making (Rec 10.4)

**Diabetes**
- **Type 1 diabetes: “should not donate.”** (Rec 11.8)
- Prediabetes/type 2 diabetes: individualized (Rec 11.9)

**Kidney stones**
- Candidates with prior/current stones: assess recurrence risk; acceptance based on recurrence risk and consequences (Rec 8.1–8.4)

**Active malignancy**
- **“In general, donor candidates with active malignancy should be excluded from donation.”** (Rec 13.2)

**Genetic kidney disease**
- **“Donor candidates found to have a genetic kidney disease that can cause kidney failure should not donate.”** (Rec 14.3)
- **ADPKD: “should not donate.”** (Rec 14.6)

---

### 7) Postdonation population: living kidney donors (follow-up subgroup)
The guideline explicitly targets people after donation:
- **“The following should be performed at least annually postdonation…”** (Rec 19.2)
- **“Donors should be monitored for CKD…”** (Rec 19.3)

This is a distinct target population from “candidates,” because it applies after nephrectomy.

---

## What is outside scope (implicit exclusions)
Unlike many oncology guidelines, KDIGO does not define scope by disease stage; instead it is bounded by **role (living kidney donation)**. People outside scope include:
- Individuals **not being evaluated for living kidney donation** and **not living kidney donors**
- **Deceased donation** processes (only referenced indirectly)
- **Recipient management** is repeatedly described as not the focus (e.g., Chapter 3 notes recipient care is out of scope, though recipient outcomes are discussed for counseling context)

If you want, I can convert the above into a single “TARGET POPULATION” paragraph in the same style as your examples (with explicit inclusions/exclusions).",periop,target_population_extraction
PMC5540357.txt,"The KDIGO 2017 Living Kidney Donor guideline is **not a “treatment guideline” that patients “use”**; it is a framework for **transplant programs** to evaluate **living kidney donor candidates**. So “exclusion criteria” in KDIGO are mainly of two types:

1) **Scope exclusions** (people/situations the guideline is not intended to address), and  
2) **Donation-ineligibility criteria** (donor-candidate findings where KDIGO explicitly says the person **should not donate**, or where donation is generally excluded).

Below is a detailed, practical list of **who cannot proceed under this guideline as a living kidney donor**, based on explicit KDIGO “should not donate / should be excluded” statements and closely related ethical requirements.

---

## A. People the guideline is not intended to apply to (scope exclusions)

### 1) Not living kidney donation
- **Deceased organ donation** (different evaluation, risks, ethics, and logistics).
- **Living donation of other organs** (liver, lung, etc.).

### 2) Not about recipient selection/outcomes
KDIGO states its scope is **donor safety** and **excludes consideration of recipient outcomes based on donor characteristics**.  
So if the question is “should we accept this donor because the recipient is urgent/highly sensitized/etc.,” that is **outside KDIGO’s scope** (centers may still consider it, but it’s not what KDIGO is designed to guide).

### 3) Jurisdictions where donation is not legally/ethically permissible
If local law/policy prohibits a donation scenario, KDIGO says local laws must be followed—so those cases are effectively **out of scope** for “proceeding.”

---

## B. Ethical/consent-based exclusions (cannot proceed to donation)

These are “hard stops” because donation must be voluntary and informed.

### 1) No capacity for informed consent
- Donor candidate **lacks capacity** to understand risks/benefits/consequences (KDIGO 2.2).
- **Substitute decision makers should not be used** for someone lacking capacity (KDIGO 2.3), except extraordinary circumstances with ethical/legal review.

**Examples:** significant cognitive impairment, severe intellectual disability preventing informed consent, some severe active psychiatric states impairing capacity.

### 2) Donation is not voluntary / coercion / undue pressure
- If voluntariness cannot be verified (KDIGO 1.1, 2.1, 2.6–2.8, 16.2).
- If the candidate is being coerced, threatened, or unduly pressured.

### 3) Candidate does not agree to proceed (withdraws)
- A candidate can withdraw at any time; the program must respect this (KDIGO 2.7).

---

## C. Medical exclusions explicitly stated as “should not donate / should be excluded”

### 1) Kidney function too low
- **GFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m²: should not donate** (KDIGO 5.8).

### 2) Albuminuria too high
- **Urine AER > 100 mg/day: should not donate** (KDIGO 6.6).

### 3) Specific kidney diseases
- **IgA nephropathy: should not donate** (KDIGO 7.4).
- **Genetic kidney disease that can cause kidney failure: should not donate** (KDIGO 14.3).
- **ADPKD: should not donate** (KDIGO 14.6).

### 4) Diabetes (type 1)
- **Type 1 diabetes mellitus: should not donate** (KDIGO 11.8).  
(Type 2 diabetes/prediabetes are not automatic exclusions in KDIGO; they require individualized risk assessment.)

### 5) Pregnancy
- **Pregnant women: should not donate while pregnant** (KDIGO 15.4).

### 6) Active cancer (generally excluded)
- **Active malignancy: in general should be excluded** (KDIGO 13.2), with rare case-by-case exceptions when transmission risk is low and donor risk is minimal.

### 7) Certain renal vascular disease
- **Atherosclerotic renal artery disease or fibromuscular dysplasia involving the orifices of both renal arteries: should not donate** (KDIGO 17.9).

---

## D. Other common “cannot proceed” situations implied by KDIGO’s framework (program threshold exclusions)

KDIGO repeatedly emphasizes that acceptance depends on whether the candidate’s **estimated short- and long-term risk** is **below the program’s acceptable risk threshold** (KDIGO 1.11–1.13). Therefore, even if KDIGO does not say “should not donate” for a condition, the candidate **cannot proceed** if:

- Their **projected postdonation risk** (e.g., kidney failure risk, perioperative risk) is **above the center’s threshold**.
- They have **uncontrolled or complicated conditions** that make surgery or long-term single-kidney health unacceptably risky per the program.

Examples where KDIGO calls for individualized decisions (so some patients will be excluded depending on severity/overall profile/center policy):
- GFR 60–89 (KDIGO 5.7)
- AER 30–100 (KDIGO 6.5)
- Hypertension controlled on 1–2 meds without target organ damage (KDIGO 10.4)
- Obesity BMI >30 (KDIGO 11.3)
- Prediabetes or type 2 diabetes (KDIGO 11.9)
- Active tobacco use (KDIGO 11.15)
- Prior/current kidney stones depending on recurrence risk (KDIGO 8.4)
- Prior hypertensive disorder of pregnancy depending on long-term risk (KDIGO 15.6)

---

## E. Psychosocial exclusions (program-defined, but KDIGO requires they exist)

KDIGO does not list a universal “do-not-donate” psychosocial checklist; instead it requires each program to have protocols defining psychosocial factors that:
- **Exclude donation**, or
- **Pause evaluation until resolved** (KDIGO 16.5).

Common examples (vary by jurisdiction/center) include: active substance use disorder, uncontrolled severe psychiatric illness, inability to adhere to follow-up, unsafe social situation, evidence of coercion, or high likelihood of severe postdonation psychosocial harm.

---

## F. Infectious risk: not always automatic exclusion, but may be

KDIGO’s infection chapter is framed as **risk assessment and shared decision-making**:
- If a potentially transmissible infection is found, donor/recipient/program should weigh risks/benefits (KDIGO 12.7).

However, in practice, some infections (or inability to mitigate transmission risk) will lead to **non-acceptance** under program policy and/or law.

### If you tell me what you mean by “cannot use this guideline” (e.g., *excluded from being a donor* vs *outside the guideline’s scope*), and your setting (country/region), I can rewrite this as a clean “exclusion criteria” section suitable for a protocol or patient handout.",periop,exclusion_criteria_extraction
PMC6681143.txt,"## TARGET POPULATION (from the guideline text provided)

### 1) Primary target population (who the guideline is aimed at)
**Patients undergoing cemented hemiarthroplasty for hip fracture**, specifically in the **peri-operative/intra-operative setting**.

**Extracted wording (key lines):**
- “Concise guidelines are presented for the preparation and conduct of anaesthesia and surgery in patients undergoing cemented hemiarthroplasty for hip fracture.”
- “This guidance is aimed at clinicians involved in the intra-operative management of patients undergoing cemented arthroplasty.”

**Significant details included in the text:**
- The guideline focuses on **preparation and conduct of anaesthesia and surgery** (i.e., intra-operative management and team processes around the operation).
- It is written for **clinicians/theatre teams** managing these cases (surgeons, anaesthetists, and broader theatre staff), but the *patient population* is those receiving **cemented hemiarthroplasty for hip fracture**.

---

### 2) High-risk subpopulation explicitly identified (subset within the target population)
Within patients undergoing cemented hemiarthroplasty for hip fracture, the guideline highlights a subgroup at **high risk of cardiorespiratory compromise** (often in the context of bone cement implantation syndrome / severe cardiovascular events).

**Extracted wording (risk identification list):**
- “Identification of patients at high risk of cardiorespiratory compromise:
  a) Increasing age;
  b) Significant cardiopulmonary disease;
  c) Diuretics;
  d) Male sex.”

**Additional extracted supporting text:**
- “Certain patient factors are associated with an increased risk of severe cardiovascular events during cemented hemiarthroplasty, in particular increasing age, male sex, significant cardiopulmonary disease and use of diuretic medication.”

**Significant details included in the text:**
- The guideline states adverse cardiovascular events occur in “approximately **20%** of hip fracture operations in which a cemented prosthesis is used.”
- The high-risk factors are used to trigger additional planning/precautions (e.g., multidisciplinary discussion, heightened monitoring, modified cement pressurisation).

---

## OUT OF SCOPE / EXCLUSIONS (explicitly stated)
The guideline **does not cover**:
- “the consenting process”
- “the choice of surgical intervention” (not deciding cemented vs uncemented, etc.; those decisions are said to be covered in other national guidelines)

**Extracted wording:**
- “The guidance does not include the consenting process, or the choice of surgical intervention, which is covered in existing national guidelines.”

---

## Segmented “target population” summary (as you requested)

### A) All included patients
**Adults/older patients with hip fracture undergoing cemented hemiarthroplasty** (the document does not specify age cutoffs, but hip fracture hemiarthroplasty typically implies an older/frail population; the guideline itself only says “increasing age” as a risk factor).

### B) High-risk patients (special focus)
Patients undergoing the same procedure **with elevated risk of intra-operative cardiorespiratory compromise**, especially those with:
- increasing age  
- significant cardiopulmonary disease  
- diuretic use  
- male sex  

### C) Not addressed by this guideline
Patients/topics related to:
- consent discussions  
- selecting the surgical approach/intervention (procedure choice)  

If you upload the full PDF or images of the guideline pages, I can extract the target population verbatim (including any “Scope/Population” section headings) and format it exactly like your examples.",periop,target_population_extraction
PMC6681143.txt,"This 2015 safety guideline is **not a “patient eligibility” guideline** in the sense of listing people who *must not* have cemented hemiarthroplasty. It is a **risk‑reduction guideline for teams** managing patients who are undergoing (or are planned to undergo) **cemented hemiarthroplasty for hip fracture**. So, strictly speaking, it contains **no absolute patient exclusion criteria**.

That said, there are clear situations where a patient would be considered **outside the scope** of the guideline, or where the team should consider **avoiding cement** (i.e., choosing a different fixation strategy) because the patient is **high risk**.

## 1) Patients outside the scope (i.e., the guideline doesn’t apply)
These patients are not “excluded from care,” but the guideline is **not written for them**:

1. **Not having a cemented hemiarthroplasty**
   - Uncemented hemiarthroplasty
   - Total hip arthroplasty (THA) for fracture
   - Internal fixation (e.g., screws, DHS, IM nail)
   - Non-operative management

2. **Not a hip fracture population**
   - Elective arthroplasty (e.g., osteoarthritis)
   - Revision arthroplasty
   - Other trauma cases not involving hip fracture hemiarthroplasty

3. **Topics the guideline explicitly does not cover**
   - **Consent process**
   - **Choice of surgical intervention** (cemented vs uncemented, hemi vs THA, etc.)—it states these are covered by other national guidelines.

## 2) “High-risk” patients (not excluded, but may prompt avoiding cement or modifying technique)
The guideline specifically highlights patient factors associated with **higher risk of severe cardiorespiratory compromise** (i.e., severe BCIS). These are not “cannot use,” but they are the group in whom teams should take extra precautions and may consider alternatives:

- **Increasing age**
- **Significant cardiopulmonary disease**
  - Examples in practice: severe aortic stenosis, pulmonary hypertension, right heart failure, severe COPD, severe LV dysfunction, recent major cardiac events (the guideline doesn’t list these examples, but this is the typical clinical interpretation of “significant” disease)
- **Use of diuretics** (marker of heart failure/fluid balance vulnerability)
- **Male sex**

In these patients, the guideline explicitly advises (among other measures):
- heightened preparation and monitoring, and
- the surgeon should **avoid vigorous cement pressurisation** in those judged at risk of cardiovascular compromise.

## 3) Practical “cannot use” interpretation (what the guideline implies, even if not stated as exclusions)
If you are asking, “Which patients should *not* receive cemented hemiarthroplasty?”—this document **does not define that**. It instead assumes surgery proceeds and focuses on making it safer. Decisions to avoid cement would be made using other guidance plus multidisciplinary judgment, particularly when the above high-risk features are present.

If you tell me whether you mean **(a)** “who is outside the guideline’s scope” or **(b)** “who should not get cement,” I can tailor the exclusion list accordingly and, if you want, map it to common BCIS risk stratification used in practice.",periop,exclusion_criteria_extraction
PMC11224558.txt,"## TARGET POPULATION (extracted from the guideline text provided)

This guideline’s recommendations apply to **patients undergoing urological surgery**, with the target population effectively segmented by **type of urological procedure** (and, for many procedures, also by **patient-specific VTE risk factors**).

Below are the distinct target populations explicitly described or implied by each recommendation.

---

## 1) Target population: Ambulatory day urological surgery patients
**Population described:**
- **All patients undergoing ambulatory day surgery** in urology.

**Examples of procedures explicitly listed:**
- Circumcision  
- Vasectomy  
- Hydrocoelectomy  
- Ureteroscopy  

**How the guideline frames this group:**
- Considered to have **symptomatic VTE risk similar to the general population**.
- Therefore, the guideline addresses whether to use **pharmacologic** and/or **mechanical** prophylaxis in this low-risk procedural setting.

---

## 2) Target population: High-VTE-risk major open urologic oncology surgery patients
**Population described:**
- **All patients undergoing:**
  - **Open radical cystectomy**, OR
  - **Open radical prostatectomy with extended lymphadenectomy**

**How the guideline frames this group:**
- These procedures are characterized as having:
  - **Relatively high VTE risk**
  - **Much lower risk of major bleeding** (relative to the VTE risk)
- The guideline states that **procedural factors outweigh patient-specific factors** here, meaning prophylaxis is favored **across all patient risk strata**.

**Intervention context tied to this population:**
- Use of **pharmacological prophylaxis** is recommended (strength varies by risk stratum).
- **Mechanical prophylaxis** is suggested.

---

## 3) Target population: Patients undergoing “most other” urological procedures (procedure- and patient-factor dependent)
**Population described:**
- **Patients undergoing most other urological procedures** not included in the two groups above.

**How the guideline defines/qualifies this population:**
- For these procedures, the **net benefit of prophylaxis varies**, depending on:
  - **Procedure-specific factors**, including:
    - The procedure itself
    - **Surgical approach** (laparoscopic vs open vs robotic)
    - **Extent of lymphadenectomy**
  - **Patient-specific VTE risk factors**, including:
    - **Prior history of VTE**
    - **Age**
    - **BMI**

**Illustrative example mentioned:**
- The guideline notes that net benefit can vary, e.g., for **robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy** (example referenced with a table).

---

## 4) Cross-cutting target population: Patients receiving pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis after urologic surgery (timing/duration/agent principles)
These “Principles” apply when **pharmacological thromboprophylaxis is being used** (i.e., they define a target population based on treatment pathway rather than a specific procedure).

### 4A) Timing principle population
- **Patients for whom thromboprophylaxis is used**: start **postoperative day 1** (rather than pre-surgery).

### 4B) Duration principle population
- **Patients receiving pharmacological thromboprophylaxis**: continue for an **extended period of 2–4 weeks**.

### 4C) Agent selection principle population
- **Patients receiving pharmacological thromboprophylaxis** after urological procedures:
  - **LMWH can be used**
  - **DOACs may be used**
  - Caution is noted for patients expected to have **decreased gastric motility/ileus** (relevant to DOAC use).

---

### Consolidated “Target Population” statement (clean version)
**Adult patients undergoing urological surgery**, segmented into:
1) **Ambulatory day urological surgery patients** (e.g., circumcision, vasectomy, hydrocoelectomy, ureteroscopy)  
2) **Patients undergoing open radical cystectomy or open radical prostatectomy with extended lymphadenectomy**  
3) **Patients undergoing other urological procedures**, where prophylaxis decisions depend on **procedure type/approach/lymphadenectomy** and **patient VTE risk factors** (prior VTE, age, BMI)  
and including patients receiving pharmacologic prophylaxis for whom guidance is provided on **start time (POD1), duration (2–4 weeks), and agent choice (LMWH/DOAC)**.

If you upload the PDF or full guideline document (or provide the citation/link), I can extract the exact “Target population” section verbatim (if it exists as a labeled heading) and confirm whether any exclusions (e.g., pediatrics, pregnancy, anticoagulated patients) are stated elsewhere.",periop,target_population_extraction
PMC11224558.txt,"The excerpt you provided is a **urology-specific peri‑operative VTE prophylaxis guideline**. It does not list a single “exclusion criteria” table, but it *does* clearly identify groups in whom the guideline’s recommendations **do not apply as “use prophylaxis”** (i.e., they should *not* receive it), and it also implies common clinical situations where **pharmacologic prophylaxis cannot be used** (standard contraindications), even if a procedure is usually “high VTE risk.”

Below are the practical “who cannot use this guideline / who should not be given prophylaxis per this guideline” categories, based on the text you shared and standard implementation logic.

---

## 1) Patients undergoing ambulatory day urologic surgery (explicit “do not use”)
**These patients should not receive prophylaxis under this guideline (Recommendation 1):**
- **No pharmacological prophylaxis** (Grade 1B)
- **No mechanical prophylaxis** (Grade 1B)

Examples explicitly listed:
- Circumcision  
- Vasectomy  
- Hydrocoelectomy  
- Ureteroscopy  
(and similar true day-case/ambulatory procedures)

**Reason:** VTE risk is similar to the general population; prophylaxis offers only marginal benefit and may increase bleeding/burden/cost.

So, if someone is in this category, they are effectively “excluded” from receiving prophylaxis according to this guideline.

---

## 2) Patients/procedures not covered by the “urology procedures” scope (implicit scope exclusion)
This document is written for **urological surgery**. Patients are outside the guideline’s intended use if they are:
- Undergoing **non-urological operations** (general surgery, orthopedics, neurosurgery, etc.)
- Undergoing **medical (non-surgical) admissions** where VTE prophylaxis decisions follow medical-patient guidance
- In **pediatric** populations (not mentioned here; many peri-op VTE guidelines are adult-focused unless stated otherwise)
- In **pregnancy/postpartum** (not addressed here; usually separate guidance)

(These are “scope exclusions”: the guideline simply isn’t designed to answer those cases.)

---

## 3) Patients in whom pharmacologic prophylaxis is contraindicated (not listed in your excerpt, but required for safe use)
Even when Recommendation 2 says “use pharmacological prophylaxis” (e.g., open radical cystectomy), **you still cannot give anticoagulant prophylaxis** to patients with standard contraindications, such as:
- **Active major bleeding** or uncontrolled surgical bleeding
- **Very high bleeding risk** where the surgeon/anesthesiologist judges anticoagulation unsafe
- **Severe thrombocytopenia** (very low platelets) or major coagulopathy
- **Recent hemorrhagic stroke** (timing-dependent)
- **Known heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)** → cannot use heparin/LMWH
- **Severe renal failure** may preclude standard LMWH dosing (may require alternative agent/dose strategy)
- **Severe hepatic failure/coagulopathy** (agent-dependent)
- **Allergy/intolerance** to the proposed agent

In these patients, the “use pharmacologic prophylaxis” recommendation cannot be applied as written; clinicians would need an alternative strategy (often mechanical prophylaxis if appropriate, or specialist input).

---

## 4) Patients for whom DOAC prophylaxis is not appropriate (agent-specific limitation noted)
The guideline says **LMWH can be used** and **DOACs may be used**, but it flags a situation where DOACs may be unsuitable:
- Postoperative patients expected to have **decreased gastric motility or ileus** (absorption concerns)

Other common practical DOAC “can’t use” situations (not in your excerpt but typically necessary for implementation) include:
- Severe renal impairment (drug-specific thresholds)
- Significant drug–drug interactions
- Inability to take oral meds reliably

---

## 5) “Most other urological procedures”: not excluded, but not eligible for a one-size-fits-all rule
For **most other urologic surgeries** (Recommendation 3), the guideline explicitly says a **tailored approach is preferred** because net benefit depends on:
- Procedure type and approach (open vs laparoscopic vs robotic)
- Extent of lymphadenectomy
- Patient factors (prior VTE, age, BMI)

These patients are **not excluded from the guideline**, but they are **excluded from simple blanket rules**—you’re expected to individualize.

---

### Bottom line
If you mean “who should not receive prophylaxis according to this guideline,” the clearest exclusion is:

1) **All ambulatory day-surgery urology patients** → **no pharmacologic or mechanical prophylaxis**.

If you mean “who cannot be managed using these recommendations safely,” then add:

2) **Anyone outside urology surgery scope**, and  
3) **Anyone with contraindications to anticoagulants** (and DOAC-specific limitations like ileus).

If you tell me the **specific procedure** and key patient factors (age, BMI, prior VTE, renal function, bleeding risk), I can map them to which recommendation pathway applies.",periop,exclusion_criteria_extraction

If you upload the actual PDF/image of the guideline (the “attached guideline”), I can extract the *exact* “Target Population” section verbatim (if present) and reconcile it against the stage/subgroup definitions above.",periop,target_population_extraction
PMC12574511.txt,"This guideline is **not a “one-size-fits-all” document for every lung cancer patient**. It is written for **perioperative multimodality management of NSCLC**—i.e., patients being considered for **curative-intent surgery** (with neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant systemic therapy, radiotherapy, perioperative care, and follow-up). Patients who fall outside that scope, or who have contraindications to the specific interventions, effectively **cannot use the guideline (or can only use parts of it)**.

Below are the practical **exclusion criteria / non-applicable patient groups**, derived from the guideline’s stated scope and from the eligibility assumptions embedded in its recommendations.

---

## 1) Patients who do **not** have NSCLC
The guideline applies to **non-small cell lung cancer** only. It does **not** apply to:
- **Small cell lung cancer (SCLC)**
- **Pulmonary carcinoid / neuroendocrine tumors** (typical/atypical)
- **Metastatic tumors to the lung** from other primaries
- Benign lung lesions

---

## 2) NSCLC patients who are **not in the perioperative (surgery) pathway**
Because the guideline is “perioperative multimodality treatment,” it is not intended for patients who are **not candidates for curative-intent resection**, such as:

### A. Clearly unresectable disease / palliative-intent settings
- **Widely metastatic (stage IV) NSCLC** where surgery is not part of management (except rare oligometastatic strategies, which are not the focus here)
- **Unresectable locally advanced disease** where definitive chemoradiation (without surgery) is standard and surgery is not planned

### B. Patients treated with non-surgical curative approaches
- Patients planned for **definitive radiotherapy/SBRT** instead of surgery (common in medically inoperable early-stage disease). The guideline’s perioperative recommendations won’t fit.

---

## 3) Patients who are **medically ineligible for surgery** (or cannot tolerate it)
Many recommendations assume the patient can undergo surgery after neoadjuvant therapy and can recover postoperatively. The guideline is not applicable as a “perioperative pathway” for patients with prohibitive operative risk, for example:
- Severe cardiopulmonary dysfunction (e.g., very poor pulmonary reserve, uncontrolled heart failure, unstable coronary disease)
- Poor performance status/frailty where surgery is not feasible
- Other major comorbidities making anesthesia/major thoracic surgery unsafe

(These patients may still use *some* general supportive elements—nutrition, symptom control—but not the core perioperative multimodality strategy.)

---

## 4) Patients who have **contraindications to key drug classes** (can’t follow the regimen-specific parts)
Even if a patient is perioperative, they may be excluded from **specific** recommendations because they cannot safely receive the proposed therapy.

### A. Cannot receive immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs)
The guideline repeatedly limits neoadjuvant/adjuvant immunotherapy to patients **“without contraindications for ICIs.”** Patients who generally should **not** use ICI-based parts include (typical clinical contraindication groups):
- Active or uncontrolled **autoimmune disease** requiring systemic immunosuppression
- Need for **high-dose systemic steroids**/immunosuppressants (baseline)
- Prior severe **immune-related adverse event** to checkpoint inhibitors
- Certain **organ transplant** recipients (high rejection risk)
- Uncontrolled interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis history (high risk with ICIs)

### B. Cannot receive platinum-based chemotherapy
Adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy recommendations assume ability to tolerate platinum doublets. Excluded from those parts are patients with:
- Poor marrow reserve (severe baseline cytopenias)
- Significant renal dysfunction (especially for cisplatin)
- Severe neuropathy/hearing loss (cisplatin-limiting)
- Very poor performance status or intolerance to cytotoxic therapy

### C. Cannot receive anticoagulation for VTE prophylaxis
The VTE recommendation is explicitly conditional: **“In the absence of bleeding risks and other contraindications…”**
So patients with any of the following are excluded from pharmacologic prophylaxis recommendations (and need individualized plans):
- Active bleeding
- High bleeding risk (e.g., recent hemorrhagic stroke, uncontrolled GI bleeding)
- Severe thrombocytopenia
- Known heparin allergy or history of **HIT** (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia)

### D. Cannot receive radiotherapy (or PORT not applicable)
PORT recommendations apply only to certain postoperative risk groups and are not “routine.” Patients for whom PORT guidance is not applicable include:
- Patients without the indicated risk profile (e.g., **R0 resection, standard radical surgery, no high-risk features**—PORT “not routinely recommended”)
- Patients unable to tolerate thoracic radiotherapy due to unacceptable predicted lung/heart dose constraints or severe baseline lung disease (clinical exclusion in practice)

### E. Targeted therapy sections only apply if the driver alteration exists
Neoadjuvant/adjuvant targeted therapy recommendations apply to:
- **EGFR mutation-positive** (EGFR-TKI)
- **ALK-positive** (ALK-TKI)
Patients **without** these alterations are excluded from those targeted-therapy pathways.

---

## 5) Stage groups outside the guideline’s main evidence base (limited applicability)
Although the document discusses multiple stages, the strongest perioperative systemic therapy recommendations are concentrated in:
- **Resectable stage IIA–IIIA** for neoadjuvant chemo‑immunotherapy
- **Stage IB–IIIA** for adjuvant EGFR-TKI (if EGFR+)
- **Stage II–IIIA** for adjuvant chemotherapy (driver-negative) and for adjuvant chemo‑immunotherapy in selected PD‑L1+ patients

Therefore, patients outside these stage ranges may not be able to “use” the guideline as written (or only partially), such as:
- **Stage IA** (adjuvant chemotherapy generally not recommended; much of multimodality content won’t apply)
- Very advanced/unresectable **IIIC/IV** (not perioperative)
- Special scenarios not covered well by the evidence base (e.g., unusual histologies, complex oligometastatic surgical strategies)

---

## 6) Patients not managed in the intended setting/population
This guideline was developed with Chinese practice patterns, access, and reimbursement in mind. It may be less directly applicable to:
- Settings where recommended drugs/diagnostics (PD‑L1 testing, broad NGS, specific ICIs/TKIs) are unavailable
- Patients unable to complete required staging/genetic testing (since several recommendations require these results before choosing therapy)

---

### Bottom line (who “cannot use” it)
A patient generally **cannot use this guideline as their main pathway** if they:
1) **Don’t have NSCLC**, or  
2) **Aren’t in a curative-intent surgical (perioperative) plan**, or  
3) **Cannot undergo surgery**, or  
4) Have **contraindications** to the specific modality being recommended (ICI, platinum chemo, anticoagulation, radiotherapy), or  
5) Are in a **stage/clinical scenario not represented** by the guideline’s perioperative evidence base.

If you tell me the patient’s **stage (TNM), resectability, driver mutations (EGFR/ALK), PD‑L1, performance status, and key comorbidities**, I can map exactly which sections are applicable vs excluded.",periop,exclusion_criteria_extraction
PMC11744056.txt,"## TARGET POPULATION (extracted from the guideline text you provided)

### Primary target population (who the algorithm/guideline is for)
**Patients with skin of color (SOC)** undergoing **facial aesthetic (anti‑aging/skin rejuvenation) procedures** using:
- **Nonenergy-based treatments** (explicit examples given: **chemical peels, injectables**), and/or
- **Nonablative energy-based devices** (i.e., **nonablative lasers/energy devices** used for facial rejuvenation)

This is stated in multiple places, including:
- Abstract/Background: “anti‑aging facial procedures… in **patients with skin of color (SOC)**”
- Conclusions: “guidelines… for… devices for **SOC patients**… skincare recommendations pre‑, peri‑, and post‑aesthetic procedures”
- Introduction: “provide clinicians with periprocedural adjunctive skincare recommendations for **SOC patients receiving skin rejuvenation treatments with nonenergy‑based treatments… or nonablative energy devices**”

### How “skin of color” is operationalized in the document
The guideline frames SOC in relation to **Fitzpatrick Skin Phototype (SPT)** and notes that:
- Fitzpatrick phototyping originally included **SPT I–IV**, later expanded to include **SPT V and VI** “to include individuals with brown or black skin color.”
- The document’s focus is on SOC patients, discussed in the context of pigmentary risk (e.g., post‑inflammatory pigment alteration).

So, while it does not provide a single strict SPT cutoff in the excerpt, it clearly anchors SOC to **darker phototypes (notably SPT V–VI)** and broader “brown or black skin color” framing.

---

## Target-population segmentation (by procedure type explicitly covered)

### 1) SOC patients receiving **nonenergy-based facial aesthetic procedures**
**Includes** (explicitly mentioned):
- **Chemical peels**
- **Injectables** (e.g., dermal fillers are discussed)

**Why SOC is specifically targeted here (risk/concerns emphasized):**
- SOC patients may have major concerns about **uneven skin tone** and **post‑inflammatory pigment alteration (PA)**, including **hyperpigmentation and hypopigmentation**.
- The algorithm aims to “optimize outcomes, prevent sequelae, reduce recovery time, and improve comfort” specifically in SOC.

**Procedure-day note relevant to this subgroup (from the guideline):**
- The text states: “There is **no significant risk for PA or scar formation after dermal filler injections in SOC patients**” (still within an SOC-focused framework).

---

### 2) SOC patients receiving **nonablative energy-based facial procedures**
**Includes**:
- **Nonablative laser/energy device facial treatments** (nonablative laser section is explicitly included)

**Why SOC is specifically targeted here (risk/concerns emphasized):**
- The guideline repeatedly highlights pigmentary sequelae risk and prevention in SOC, including:
  - **Post‑inflammatory hyperpigmentation** risk and mitigation strategies
  - Emphasis on **photoprotection** and **barrier-supportive skincare**
  - Discussion of combining devices with topical agents (e.g., antioxidants; tranexamic acid/kojic acid/niacinamide in melasma-related contexts)

---

## Population context and setting (as described)
- The guideline is written for **clinical use by aesthetic/dermatology providers** delivering these procedures, emphasizing:
  - **Pre‑procedure assessment** (medical history, skin exam, expectations)
  - **Periprocedural skincare integration** (pre, day-of, aftercare, follow-up)

---

## What is *not* clearly included/excluded (based on the provided text)
The excerpt **does not explicitly define exclusions** such as:
- Age limits (e.g., adult-only)  
- Non-facial procedures (it is consistently framed as **facial**)
- Specific medical contraindications (not stated as “outside scope” in the excerpt)

If you upload the full PDF or the missing sections/figure referenced (“Figure…”, “Table…”), I can verify whether the guideline contains an explicit “scope/target population” box with formal inclusion/exclusion criteria.",periop,target_population_extraction
PMC11744056.txt,"The paper is a **periprocedural skincare algorithm** (not a “who is eligible for treatment” guideline), so it does **not** present a single, explicit “exclusion criteria” list the way a clinical trial would. Instead, the practical “cannot use / should not be managed with this algorithm as written” groups fall into two buckets:

1) **People outside the scope the algorithm was designed for**, and  
2) **People who should not undergo (or should defer) the underlying aesthetic procedure**, in whom a skincare algorithm alone is not appropriate.

Below are the clearest exclusion/“not applicable” categories based on the document you provided.

---

## 1) Outside the intended scope (algorithm does not apply)

### A. Not “skin of color” as defined by the article’s intent
- The algorithm is specifically for **patients with skin of color (SOC)**, generally corresponding to **Fitzpatrick phototypes IV–VI** (and sometimes III–VI depending on local usage, but the paper’s focus is SOC).
- Patients with **Fitzpatrick I–II (and often III)** are not the target population; the algorithm may still be usable, but it is **not validated/aimed** at them.

### B. Not a *facial* aesthetic procedure
- The algorithm is written for **facial** rejuvenation contexts.  
- Procedures on **body sites** (neck/chest/back/limbs, etc.) are not covered and may have different risks (e.g., scarring, PIH patterns, aftercare needs).

### C. Procedures not covered: energy types outside “nonenergy” and “nonablative”
The guideline is for:
- **Nonenergy** procedures (e.g., injectables, chemical peels), and
- **Nonablative energy-based devices**.

It therefore does **not** apply (or only partially applies) to:
- **Ablative lasers** (e.g., fully ablative CO₂/Er:YAG resurfacing),
- **Ablative fractional resurfacing** (often managed differently),
- Other higher-risk resurfacing approaches where wound care protocols are central and different.

### D. Not about general medical dermatology or treatment of active disease
If the visit is primarily for **active inflammatory or infectious dermatoses** (rather than elective aesthetic rejuvenation), this algorithm is not the right framework.

---

## 2) Patients who should not use the algorithm *because they should not proceed with the procedure (or should defer)*

The paper’s “History and Skin Examination” section implies screening for factors that would make outcomes unsafe or unpredictable. While it doesn’t list formal contraindications, in real-world use the following groups are typically **not appropriate to proceed** with elective procedures (and therefore cannot simply “use the guideline” as a substitute):

### A. Active skin infection or uncontrolled inflammation at the treatment site
Examples (not exhaustively listed in the excerpt, but standard for these procedures):
- Active **bacterial infection**, **impetigo**, **cellulitis**
- Active **herpes simplex** outbreak (especially relevant for perioral procedures/lasers/peels)
- Significant **dermatitis**, **eczema flare**, or other uncontrolled inflammatory eruption

### B. Patients with unrealistic expectations or poor procedural candidacy on assessment
The algorithm explicitly starts with exploring:
- **Motivation and expectations**
If expectations are unrealistic or there are psychosocial red flags (e.g., body dysmorphic concerns), the appropriate action is typically **not to proceed**—so the algorithm would not be “usable” in the intended way.

### C. Patients whose medications/behaviors cannot be modified when needed
The paper notes that patients are “in general” recommended to withhold:
- **Anti-inflammatory drugs** (to reduce bleeding risk),
- **Topical retinoids** (to reduce irritation/complications),
- **Tobacco** (to support wound healing).

If a patient **cannot or will not** pause relevant agents/behaviors when clinically necessary, the procedure (and thus the algorithm) may be inappropriate or require a different plan.

### D. Patients with prior severe adverse reactions to similar procedures
The history specifically includes response to:
- **Dermabrasion, chemical peels, and laser treatments**
If a patient has a history of severe **post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH)**, **hypopigmentation**, **hypertrophic scarring/keloids**, or other serious complications, they may need:
- a different risk–benefit decision,
- a modified protocol beyond what the algorithm covers, or
- avoidance of certain procedures altogether.

---

## Important note on what the paper does *not* specify
The excerpt you provided does **not** explicitly list common “absolute contraindications” (e.g., pregnancy/lactation restrictions for certain agents, isotretinoin timing, immunosuppression, bleeding disorders, etc.). That means you **cannot claim** the guideline excludes those groups based solely on this text—those would come from standard procedural contraindication checklists rather than this algorithm.

---

## If you want, I can tailor this to a specific procedure
Tell me which procedure(s) you mean (e.g., **chemical peel**, **botulinum toxin**, **hyaluronic acid filler**, **nonablative fractional laser**, **1064-nm Nd:YAG**, etc.) and the patient’s key factors (history of PIH/keloids, current topicals, recent tanning, active acne/eczema, etc.), and I’ll list the **practical “do not treat / defer / treat with modifications”** criteria for that scenario.",periop,exclusion_criteria_extraction
PMC7274637.txt,"## TARGET POPULATION (extracted from the guideline text)

### 1) People with obesity who are candidates for **scheduled bariatric/metabolic (weight-loss) surgery** during/after the Covid-19 pandemic
**Target population text (verbatim/near-verbatim from the guideline):**
- “**population with obesity**” / “**persons with obesity**”
- “**candidates for this surgery**” (bariatric/metabolic surgery)
- “Each bariatric surgery centre will have a list of patients **whose indications have been validated by multidisciplinary concertation after a preparation lasting more than 6 months**.”
- “**Who is eligible for scheduled bariatric surgery?** In what setting?” (section heading framing the eligible population)
- “The surgical indications to be preferred in the case of scheduled surgery are those designated as **primary surgery**.”

**Significant details / inclusion characteristics stated in the guideline:**
- Patients with obesity for whom bariatric/metabolic surgery is indicated, particularly where delay risks deterioration of health and comorbidities.
- Patients already in the bariatric pathway with an indication validated by a multidisciplinary team (MDT) after prolonged preparation (>6 months).
- Priority ranking is based largely on **diabetes status** and **severity/number of comorbidities**, and on time-sensitivity due to other needed treatments.

**Priority subgroups explicitly described (the guideline’s “priority ranking” criteria):**
The guideline proposes prioritizing patients whose indication is validated/being validated in MDT and who meet one or more of the following:
- **Diabetes-related priority features**:
  - “**time since diagnosis < 3 years**”, or
  - “**needing insulin treatment**”, or
  - “**with equilibration difficulties**” (difficulty achieving glycemic control)
- **Non-diabetes comorbidity priority features**:
  - “**≥ 2 comorbidities**”, or
  - “**1 severe comorbidity**”
- **Time-sensitive competing-care needs**:
  - “**waiting for other important treatment (organ transplant, joint prosthesis, medically assisted procreation)**”
- **Symptoms resistant to medical therapy that surgery can improve**:
  - “**gastro-oesophageal reflux, pain, dysphagia, etc.**”

**Important exclusions / out-of-scope constraints stated:**
- “**do not operate on Covid+ patients or patients with known Covid+ history** (given the current lack of evidence for effective immunization).”
- “**If Covid-19 is suspected, surgery must be postponed.**”
- Secondary bariatric surgery **for weight loss** (weight regain/insufficient loss) should generally be deferred until the epidemic abates locally/regionally.

---

### 2) Patients with obesity needing **urgent medical/surgical care** (including bariatric-surgery complications) during the pandemic
**Target population text (verbatim/near-verbatim):**
- “**Urgent medical and surgical care for patients with obesity, and care for bariatric surgery complications**”
- “This section applies equally to **patients operated on during and before the pandemic**.”
- “any patient **with or without a recent history of weight-loss surgery** who presents signs such as a cough, high temperature, abdominal pains, tachycardia or other digestive signs (nausea, diarrhoea) requires a prompt opinion from a surgeon specialised in weight-loss surgery…”
- “Special attention must be paid to **patients aged over 60**.”

**Significant details / inclusion characteristics stated:**
- People with obesity who develop **medical or surgical problems** during the pandemic, including:
  - complications after bariatric surgery (recent or remote history),
  - symptoms that may overlap with Covid-19 (fever, cough) but could represent surgical complications.
- Includes a large background population: “**Some 1% of French nationals have a weight-loss surgery history**.”

**Care-pathway features tied to this population (as written):**
- “every medical or surgical problem in a patient with obesity must be dealt with in a consultation (**ideally a teleconsultation**)… [clinician] will decide whether the patient must come in person…”
- Need for **rapid access to teleconsultation** to avoid unnecessary ED use.
- Emphasis on **specialist bariatric surgeon input** promptly in urgent cases.

---

### 3) Patients planned for surgery who are **Covid-negative (Covid-negative circuit)** and undergoing the peri-operative pathway
This is a narrower operational target group: obese patients proceeding to surgery under a Covid-negative pathway.

**Target population text (verbatim/near-verbatim):**
- “**Clinical pathway to bariatric surgery for a Covid-negative patient**” (pre-, peri-, post-operative sections)
- “An **RT-PCR screening test** … must be carried out at surgery D–2… If the test is positive, then the surgery is cancelled… If the test is negative, a **chest CT scan is recommended**…”
- “The patient’s consent must be checked and signed… [including] risk of nosocomial Covid-19 infection and commit[ment] to post-operative home confinement…”

**Significant details:**
- Applies to bariatric candidates who:
  - screen negative on pre-op testing (PCR; CT recommended),
  - proceed through a dedicated Covid-negative circuit,
  - accept enhanced informed consent and post-op confinement expectations.

---

## Consolidated “Target Population” statement (faithful to the guideline)
These guidelines apply to **persons with obesity** who are **candidates for bariatric/metabolic (weight-loss) surgery** whose indications have typically been **validated by multidisciplinary concertation** (often after >6 months preparation), and to **patients with obesity (including those previously operated on)** who require **urgent medical/surgical care or management of bariatric-surgery complications** during the Covid-19 pandemic. The guideline emphasizes prioritization of surgical candidates based on **diabetes status and comorbidity severity**, and it **excludes/postpones surgery** for patients who are **Covid-positive, suspected Covid-19, or with a known Covid-positive history** (per the document’s stated caution about uncertain immunization).",periop,target_population_extraction
PMC7274637.txt,"The SOFFCO‑MM document is primarily a **prioritization and safety pathway** for restarting bariatric/metabolic surgery during/after Covid waves. It does not present a single boxed “exclusion list,” but it **does clearly identify situations where surgery should not be performed (or should be deferred)** under this guideline/care pathway.

Below are the practical **exclusion / “do not proceed now” categories** implied or explicitly stated in the text.

---

## 1) Patients with current or suspected Covid‑19 (must not undergo scheduled surgery)
These patients are excluded from proceeding because peri‑operative Covid infection markedly increases pulmonary complications and mortality risk.

**Includes:**
- **Any patient with symptoms suggestive of Covid‑19** at pre‑op screening (they recommend calling the day before visits to check symptoms).
- **Positive RT‑PCR at D‑2** (explicit: *if positive, surgery is cancelled*).
- **Imaging suggestive of Covid‑19** (they recommend chest CT at D‑1 after a negative PCR to detect occult/asymptomatic disease; if CT suggests Covid, the intent is to avoid anesthesia/surgery and postpone).

**Bottom line:** If Covid is suspected or confirmed, **postpone**.

---

## 2) Patients with a *known prior Covid‑19 history* (surgery deferred)
The guideline explicitly states a conservative rule during the pandemic period:

- **Do not operate on Covid+ patients or patients with known Covid+ history**, because at the time of writing **immunization/reinfection risk was uncertain**.

So, even if recovered, a **documented previous Covid infection** is treated as a reason to **defer** surgery (timing not precisely defined in the excerpt; it’s framed as a pandemic‑safety policy).

---

## 3) Patients needing “secondary” bariatric surgery *for weight loss only* (generally deferred)
The guideline distinguishes revision surgery types:

### Excluded/deferred (elective):
- **Revisional/secondary surgery for weight regain or insufficient weight loss**  
  Rationale: higher complication rates and variable outcomes; they recommend waiting until the epidemic abates locally/regionally and using telemedicine/nutrition/psych support in the meantime.

### Not necessarily excluded:
- Secondary surgery **for complications/sequelae** of prior bariatric surgery may proceed depending on urgency (see next section).

---

## 4) Patients whose indication is not urgent and can be managed medically during peaks (defer until lull)
For revisional surgery due to complications **without short‑term threat to life**, they advise postponing until a lull and after failure of medical therapy.

Examples they give of situations where surgery is **preferably deferred**:
- **Disabling reflux after sleeve** → continue medical therapy (diet/hygiene, PPI ± antacids) and delay surgery.
- **Severe malnutrition where revision/reversal is considered** → prefer deferral and continue **enteral/parenteral nutrition at home** if possible.

So these patients are not “never eligible,” but **excluded from proceeding during active/high‑risk pandemic phases** unless the risk/urgency changes.

---

## 5) Patients who cannot be managed in a “Covid‑negative circuit” with required screening/consent (practical exclusion)
The guideline requires a specific safe pathway. Patients may be effectively excluded if the centre cannot safely meet these conditions for them:

- **Pre‑op RT‑PCR testing** (D‑2) and communication of results before admission.
- **Chest CT** recommended after negative PCR (D‑1) to reduce false‑negative risk.
- **Specific informed consent** acknowledging:
  - risk of **nosocomial Covid infection**
  - commitment to **strict home confinement for 1 month post‑op**
- Post‑op follow‑up preferably via **teleconsultation** and structured data capture.

If a patient **refuses required screening**, **refuses/ cannot comply with post‑op confinement**, or the system cannot provide the Covid‑negative pathway, then **the guideline’s conditions for proceeding are not met**, and surgery should be deferred.

---

## 6) Patients in settings where system-level safety prerequisites are not met (centre/region exclusion)
This is not a patient medical exclusion, but it determines who “cannot use the guideline” *in practice* at a given time/place.

They stress resumption depends on:
- **ICU availability**
- **epidemic indicators** (e.g., replication rate < 1 outside peaks)
- **OR access**, beds, staffing, drug availability, and distancing constraints

If these prerequisites are not met locally, then **elective bariatric surgery should not resume**, meaning patients are temporarily excluded due to resource/safety constraints.

---

### Important nuance
These are **pandemic-specific exclusions/deferrals** layered on top of the usual bariatric surgery contraindications (which are not detailed in your excerpt). In other words, a patient might be a standard candidate for bariatric surgery but still be **excluded “for now”** under SOFFCO‑MM Covid resumption rules.

If you want, I can convert the above into a simple checklist (“Proceed / Postpone / Consider only if urgent complication”) that matches the document’s flow logic.",periop,exclusion_criteria_extraction
PMC11885198.txt,"## TARGET POPULATION (extracted from the guideline text)

This guideline does **not** present a single, explicit “Target population” heading. Instead, the target populations are described across the **Abstract/Conclusions**, **Introduction**, and the major clinical-context sections (e.g., trauma, obstetrics, paediatrics, critical care, GI bleeding, cardiac surgery). Below is the target population text **as stated or directly implied** in the document, segmented by population/context, with significant details preserved.

---

## 1) Overall / intended users and broad patient scope (peri‑operative transfusion & bleeding risk)

### Extracted target population text (closest explicit statements)
- “**The aim of these updated guidelines is to provide an evidence‐based set of recommendations so that anaesthetists and peri‐operative physicians might provide high‐quality care.**”
- “**All anaesthetists involved in the care of patients at risk of major bleeding and peri‐operative transfusion should be aware of the treatment options and approaches that are available to them. These contemporary guidelines aim to provide recommendations across a range of clinical situations.**”
- “...a need for a relevant, contemporary clinical guideline for practising **UK anaesthetists, critical care staff, allied health professionals and those from other relevant specialties and backgrounds.**”
- “Anaesthetists are often involved in decisions to administer blood components and/or alternatives, as well as the management of major haemorrhage.”

### Target population summary (overall)
- **Patients:** People in **peri-operative** and **acute care** settings who may require **blood components** (RBCs, FFP, platelets, cryoprecipitate, etc.) or **alternatives**, especially those **at risk of major bleeding** or needing **peri-operative transfusion**.
- **Clinical settings:** Broad—covers “a range of clinical situations,” including elective surgery preparation, intra-/post-operative bleeding, emergency haemorrhage, and specialty contexts (trauma, obstetrics, paediatrics, ICU, GI bleed, cardiac surgery).
- **Geography/practice context:** Written to reflect **UK anaesthesia practice**.

---

## 2) Major haemorrhage (general, non‑obstetric and trauma-related contexts)

### Extracted target population text
- “**Major haemorrhage is an important cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide.**”
- “In high‐resource settings, the most common indications for massive transfusion are **major surgery** … followed by **trauma**…”
- “**Policies should be defined in a local major haemorrhage protocol.** … protocols are encouraged to be **specific to clinical areas such as the emergency department or labour ward**…”
- “**During major haemorrhage due to trauma, preference should be given to transfusing RBCs and fresh frozen plasma (FFP).**”

### Target population summary
- **Patients with major haemorrhage**, including:
  - **Major surgical bleeding**
  - **Traumatic haemorrhage**
- Emphasis on institutions having **major haemorrhage protocols** tailored to areas like ED and labour ward (obstetrics overlaps but is addressed separately below).

---

## 3) Obstetrics (postpartum haemorrhage and obstetric bleeding)

### Extracted target population text
- “**Early recognition of obstetric bleeding is essential**…”
- “Estimating blood loss at delivery is inaccurate…”
- “As soon as abnormal bleeding is recognised (**> 500 ml after a vaginal delivery and > 1000 ml after a caesarean delivery**) the obstetrician, anaesthetist and senior midwife should attend to the mother.”
- “Hypofibrinogenaemia … is the most common factor deficiency in **PPH**…”
- “Platelet transfusion is required rarely unless **PPH is > 5000 ml** or platelet count is < 100 × 10^9.l−1 from another cause prior to the PPH.”

### Target population summary
- **Women with obstetric haemorrhage**, especially **postpartum haemorrhage (PPH)**.
- Includes explicit blood-loss thresholds defining “abnormal bleeding” at delivery:
  - **>500 mL** after vaginal delivery
  - **>1000 mL** after caesarean delivery
- Addresses haemostatic monitoring and component therapy in PPH (e.g., fibrinogen thresholds, platelet considerations).

---

## 4) Paediatrics (children receiving blood components peri‑operatively / major bleeding)

### Extracted target population text
- “**Evidence to guide the use of blood components in children undergoing surgery is limited**…”
- “Serious Hazards of Transfusion has identified a **higher incidence of serious adverse events in children** receiving blood components…”
- “It is recommended that **blood in children should be prescribed in volume rather than number of units.**”
- “Tranexamic acid should be used in **children undergoing major surgery likely to be associated with major blood loss** such as cardiac surgery, major scoliosis surgery and craniosynostosis surgery…”

### Target population summary
- **Children** (including distinctions noted in text):
  - “almost all children **over 3 months of age**” (for restrictive RBC thresholds)
  - **Neonates** and children with **congenital heart disease** noted as groups where higher thresholds are often applied (though not precisely defined)
- Paediatric transfusion is framed around **weight-based volumes** and paediatric major-surgery contexts.

---

## 5) Critical care / ICU (anaemia and transfusion in critically ill patients)

### Extracted target population text
- “**Anaemia is common in patients who are critically ill**…”
- “A restrictive transfusion threshold of **Hb < 70 g.l−1 is recommended in most patients, including those with ARDS and septic shock.**”
- “Available evidence does not support the routine use of iron therapy and/or erythropoietin to treat anaemia in patients who are critically ill.”

### Target population summary
- **Critically ill patients** in ICU/critical care settings, including:
  - **ARDS**
  - **Septic shock**
- Focus is anaemia management and RBC transfusion thresholds in ICU.

---

## 6) Prehospital trauma (serious injury before hospital arrival)

### Extracted target population text
- “**Prehospital management of major traumatic haemorrhage is evolving constantly.**”
- “Anaesthetists are involved increasingly in the care of these **seriously ill and injured patients** that need airway protection, ventilatory support or transfusion support before they arrive in hospital.”
- “Approximately a quarter of patients with severe trauma will present with coagulopathy…”

### Target population summary
- **Severely injured trauma patients** in the **prehospital** phase who may need:
  - airway/ventilation support
  - early haemorrhage control
  - early transfusion / haemostatic resuscitation

---

## 7) Cardiac surgery (including cardiopulmonary bypass considerations)

### Extracted target population text
- “Anaemia is associated with poor outcomes in patients undergoing **cardiac surgery**…”
- “Pooled data from eight RCTs showed no evidence of an impact on clinically important outcomes when a restrictive RBC transfusion policy was followed…”
- “Challenges arise when patients are unwilling to receive allogeneic blood due to religious or other beliefs…”

### Target population summary
- **Patients undergoing cardiac surgery**, including those on **cardiopulmonary bypass**.
- Also includes a practical subgroup: patients **unwilling to receive allogeneic blood** (religious/other beliefs), where acceptability of options should be discussed.

---

## 8) Acute gastrointestinal bleeding

### Extracted target population text
- “**Acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding is common**…”
- “High certainty evidence recommends a transfusion threshold of **70 g.l−1**, aiming for a target of **70–100 g.l−1**…”
- “The incidence of **lower gastrointestinal bleeding** is increasing…”

### Target population summary
- Patients with **acute GI bleeding**:
  - **Upper GI bleeding**
  - **Lower GI bleeding**
- Focus on transfusion thresholds and acute management context.

---

## 9) Patients receiving transfusion / needing compatibility testing and safe administration (process-focused population)

### Extracted target population text (process applicability)
- “**Positive patient identification is paramount prior to any blood transfusion episode**…”
- “Blood samples must be collected and … labelled at the patient's side…”
- “During the transfusion episode, patient monitoring is essential to identify and manage adverse reactions…”

### Target population summary
- **Any patient receiving a blood transfusion** in hospital settings where:
  - sampling, lab compatibility, issue, administration, and monitoring processes apply
  - includes transfer scenarios (intra-hospital and inter-hospital) during transfusion

---

## 10) Patients on anticoagulants/antiplatelets needing peri‑operative management (bleeding vs thrombosis balance)

### Extracted target population text
- “Large numbers of patients take either **anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents**…”
- “The management of these drugs in the peri‐operative setting is a common problem, necessitating the balance of bleeding risk with the risk of thrombosis.”
- “The management of these drugs in patients with **coronary stents** in situ is more challenging…”

### Target population summary
- Peri-operative patients taking:
  - **Warfarin**
  - **DOACs** (direct thrombin or Xa inhibitors)
  - **Antiplatelet therapy** (including **dual antiplatelet therapy**)
  - Special subgroup: patients with **coronary stents** needing non-cardiac surgery

---

### If you want, I can also produce a clean “TARGET POPULATION” block in the same style as your examples (single paragraph), but this guideline is written as a multi-context document, so the most faithful extraction is the segmented target populations above.",periop,target_population_extraction
PMC11885198.txt,"These Association of Anaesthetists guidelines are written to be broadly applicable to **peri‑operative and acute care patients at risk of bleeding and/or transfusion**, but they are **not a “one size fits all” document**. The paper does not present a single boxed “exclusion criteria” list; instead, it repeatedly flags **patient groups and situations where the recommendations are uncertain, need modification, or should be deferred to other specialist guidance**. In practice, the guideline should *not* be used as the sole decision tool (or should be used only with specialist input) for the following patients/situations:

## 1) Patients outside the intended clinical context (not peri‑operative/acute bleeding care)
- **Chronic transfusion programmes** (e.g., thalassaemia major, sickle cell chronic transfusion, myelodysplasia long‑term support). These require disease‑specific targets (HbS%, iron overload management, phenotype matching, etc.) not covered here.
- **Haematology/oncology prophylactic transfusion pathways** (e.g., chemotherapy‑induced cytopenias) beyond the limited procedural platelet thresholds mentioned.

## 2) Patient groups where the guideline itself states evidence is uncertain (RBC thresholds especially)
The guideline supports restrictive RBC thresholds for most stable, non‑bleeding patients, but explicitly notes **uncertainty** in several subgroups—meaning you should not apply the “Hb 70–80 g/L is safe” message without tailoring and often specialist input:
- **Acute coronary syndromes (ACS)/active myocardial ischaemia**
- **Acute brain injury** (including traumatic brain injury and some intracranial haemorrhage contexts)
- **Active cancer** (in some settings)
- **Older/frail patients** (where optimal thresholds may differ)

(These are not “cannot use any part of the guideline” groups, but they *are* groups where using the standard restrictive trigger as a rule may be inappropriate.)

## 3) Neonates and some congenital cardiac patients (paediatrics where thresholds differ)
- The guideline says restrictive thresholds are appropriate for **most children > 3 months**, but:
  - **Neonates** often have **higher transfusion thresholds** and different physiology.
  - **Children with congenital heart disease** often use different targets.
So, for neonates/complex congenital cardiac disease, this guideline should not be your primary transfusion-threshold reference.

## 4) Patients who refuse donor blood (e.g., Jehovah’s Witnesses) — guideline applies only partially
- The guideline includes blood conservation strategies (cell salvage, tranexamic acid), but **component transfusion recommendations may be unusable** if the patient declines allogeneic blood (and sometimes also declines specific “alternatives” like albumin, PCC, fibrinogen concentrate, etc.).
- In these patients, management must be based on **documented individual acceptability** and local “bloodless surgery” pathways.

## 5) Patients in whom a recommended “alternative” is contraindicated (you must not apply that element)
The guideline recommends/endorses several alternatives (e.g., tranexamic acid, cell salvage, reversal agents). Some patients cannot safely receive particular options, so those parts of the guideline effectively don’t apply:

### Tranexamic acid (TXA)
Do **not** apply “use TXA” as a blanket rule if the patient has contraindications/major cautions (common examples in practice):
- **Active intravascular clotting** / some high-risk thrombotic states (relative; requires judgement)
- **History of seizures** or high seizure risk (TXA can increase seizure risk, especially at higher doses, e.g., cardiac surgery)
- **Significant renal impairment** (dose adjustment needed; not “excluded” but the standard approach can’t be applied)

### Cell salvage
May be inappropriate/limited in:
- **Contaminated surgical fields** (e.g., gross bowel contamination) depending on local policy/filters/washing and risk assessment
- Some **malignancy** cases depending on local protocols (many centres do use it with leucocyte depletion filters, but it’s policy-dependent)

## 6) Patients on DOACs where the guideline explicitly says “don’t do X routinely”
This is an important “exclusion” in the sense of **do not follow a common off‑label practice**:
- **Do not use PCC routinely** to reverse DOACs prior to emergency surgery (per guideline).
Instead, use specific reversal agents when indicated/available (e.g., idarucizumab for dabigatran; andexanet alfa for selected Xa inhibitor bleeds), and involve haematology.

Also:
- **Andexanet alfa should not be used** when **heparin anticoagulation is required** (e.g., **cardiopulmonary bypass**, some vascular surgery). So in those patients, that part of the guideline is not applicable.

## 7) Low‑risk procedures where prophylactic plasma correction is not supported
If the “patient scenario” is:
- **Critically ill with abnormal PT/INR but not bleeding**, and
- Undergoing a **low‑bleeding‑risk procedure**,
then the guideline states there is **no good evidence** to support prophylactic FFP to “correct numbers.” So you should not use the guideline to justify prophylactic FFP in that setting.

## 8) Settings outside the UK system (organisational recommendations may not translate)
Not a patient-level exclusion, but practically important: the guideline is **UK‑centric** (SHOT, NHSBT-style component availability, major haemorrhage pack assumptions, lab pathways). In other health systems, some logistics-based recommendations may not be directly usable.

---

### Bottom line
There isn’t a single “these patients are excluded” list in the document. Instead, the guideline is **broadly applicable**, but you should *not* apply it unmodified (and sometimes should not apply specific recommendations at all) in:
- **ACS/acute brain injury/active cancer/very elderly** (threshold uncertainty),
- **neonates and some congenital heart disease**,
- **patients refusing donor blood** (component guidance may be unusable),
- **patients where TXA/cell salvage/reversal agents are contraindicated or policy-limited**,
- **DOAC patients where PCC is being considered routinely**, and
- **non-bleeding, low-risk procedure patients where prophylactic FFP is being considered**.

If you tell me the exact patient group you’re writing for (e.g., obstetrics, trauma, ICU, elective orthopaedics) and what part of the guideline you’re implementing (RBC thresholds, major haemorrhage protocol, anticoagulant reversal), I can translate this into a clean “inclusion/exclusion” section suitable for a local protocol.",periop,exclusion_criteria_extraction
PMC12338406.txt,"## TARGET POPULATION (extracted from the guideline text you provided)

This document is an ERAS/IATSIC consensus guideline focused on **trauma patients in the post‑resuscitation phase**, with emphasis on **major trauma and polytrauma patients who require ICU care**, and it addresses **ethics and systems aspects** (Part 3).

Below are the **distinct target populations explicitly described or clearly delimited in the text**, segmented by guideline section, with the key qualifying details preserved.

---

## 1) Overall guideline target population (Part 3 scope)

**Target population (overall):**
- **Trauma patients** in the **post‑resuscitation phase of care**
- Particularly **patients with major injuries and polytrauma**
- Especially the **ICU‑requiring group**
- Intended to apply across **all income settings** (not limited to high‑income/well‑resourced systems); systems guidance is meant to be **locally relevant** and not simply copied from high‑income country models.

**Key scope notes from the text:**
- ERAS concepts are harder to implement in **acute trauma** due to “deranged physiological reserve” from **penetrating or blunt trauma**.
- Evidence is sometimes **extrapolated** from elective surgery and non‑trauma emergency surgery.

---

## 2) ICU ethics: Palliative care

**Target population (palliative care recommendations):**
- **Trauma patients in the ICU** (screening recommended broadly), with emphasis on those with:
  - **Severe traumatic injury** and **high risk of in‑hospital mortality**, or
  - Anticipated **permanent disability**, or
  - Expected **functional outcome incompatible with the patient’s wishes**
- Also highlighted: **elderly injured patients with significant comorbidities** may benefit from early palliative care.

**Significant details/qualifiers:**
- “All trauma patients in the ICU should undergo screening for palliative care needs,” but certain factors increase likelihood of indicated intervention (high mortality risk, permanent disability, unacceptable functional outcome).
- **Prior health and pre‑injury functional status** should be assessed.
- Timing targets referenced (ACS‑TQIP): **palliative assessment within 24h** and **family meeting within 72h** (if needed).

---

## 3) ICU ethics: DNAR/DNR (Do Not Attempt Resuscitation)

**Target population (DNAR/DNR recommendations):**
- **Trauma patients** for whom **DNAR orders are appropriate**, including perioperative/emergency contexts, implemented:
  - “within the confines of local legal policies”
  - with required **validation/reconsideration**, **clear communication**, and a **timeline for reinitiation** if temporarily suspended.

**Significant details/qualifiers:**
- Addresses the trauma context where DNAR has historically been fully revoked perioperatively; guideline emphasizes **shared decision‑making** and documentation.
- Applies even in **time‑sensitive circumstances**, using patient or surrogate discussion when feasible.

---

## 4) ICU ethics: Advanced Care Planning (ACP)

**Target population (ACP recommendations):**
- **Trauma patients with severe injury**, especially those:
  - with **poor prognosis**, or
  - with other factors suggesting **care limitation** may be needed
- ACP identification should begin at the **entry portal of the emergency resuscitation room** (i.e., very early in the trauma pathway).

**Significant details/qualifiers:**
- Recommends **screening all patients**, then formal ACP for those meeting triggers (poor prognosis/care limitation factors).
- Implementation recommended **on admission and within 72 hours of hospitalization**.

---

## 5) Frailty: frail and elderly trauma patients

**Target population (frailty recommendations):**
- **Frail and elderly trauma patients** (explicitly described as a “vulnerable population”)

**Significant details/qualifiers:**
- Higher risk profile: **higher mortality/morbidity**, **longer hospital stays**, **lower functional outcomes** than younger trauma patients.
- Recommends use of **objective frailty screening** (no single tool preferred).
- When possible, use a **geriatric trauma consultative service** / multidisciplinary approach.

---

## 6) Long-term outcomes: PTSD after major trauma

**Target population (PTSD recommendations):**
- **Patients who survive major trauma or polytrauma**

**Significant details/qualifiers:**
- PTSD described as **not uncommon**, often assessed at **6–12 months post‑trauma**.
- Prevention is difficult; **screening is recommended**; treatment includes psychotherapy ± pharmacotherapy.

---

## 7) Systems/triage/transfer: rural, non-trauma hospitals, penetrating trauma transport

This section is “systems” rather than a clinical subgroup, but it still defines populations in scope.

### 7a) Rural and non-designated hospital trauma patients
**Target population:**
- **Rural trauma patients** and those initially managed in **non‑designated (non‑trauma) hospitals**, who may have delayed access and worse outcomes.

**Key details:**
- Focus on **timely transfer** and triage to the correct level of care.
- Aeromedical transport: suggested benefit mainly for **rural/extreme locations**, not urban.

### 7b) Urban penetrating trauma and “scoop and run”
**Target population:**
- **Urban penetrating trauma** patients, particularly:
  - **penetrating chest trauma**
  - **gunshot wounds**
where “police or other personal vehicle transport to the nearest trauma center” may improve survival vs waiting for EMS (moderate evidence for select mechanisms).

---

## 8) Older trauma patients (systems of care)

**Target population:**
- **Older trauma patients with major trauma or polytrauma**

**Significant details/qualifiers:**
- Emphasizes risk of **under‑triage** from scene to hospital level of care.
- Recommends aligning **frailty scores and injury patterns** with **age and physiology** to guide treatment and, where indicated, palliation.

---

## 9) Pediatric trauma considerations

**Target population:**
- **Children with traumatic injury** (pediatric trauma patients), with discussion framed around:
  - care in **pediatric trauma centers** vs
  - pediatric trauma care delivered in **adult trauma centers**, depending on local system realities.

**Significant details/qualifiers:**
- Notes pediatric trauma requires a multidisciplinary approach based on **anatomic, physiologic, and social needs of children**.
- States there is **no good evidence** to support pediatric‑specific trauma centers outside a few high‑income countries; local system should determine best model.

If you upload the actual PDF/image of the guideline (or confirm the pasted text is complete), I can also:
- extract any **explicit “Scope/Target population”** statements that may appear elsewhere (title page, executive summary, “intended users,” “patients included/excluded”), and
- format the output exactly like your examples (with inclusion/exclusion language).",periop,target_population_extraction
PMC12338406.txt,"This Part 3 ERATIC/ERAS–IATSIC document does **not** present a “who is excluded” list in the way many drug/device or single-intervention clinical guidelines do. It is a **systems/ethics-focused consensus guideline** intended to be broadly applicable to **major trauma/polytrauma patients (often ICU-requiring)**, with some evidence extrapolated from elective surgery. So, rather than “patients who cannot use it,” the practical exclusion criteria are really **scope limits**—situations/patient groups where the recommendations are **not intended to be applied as written** or where **local law/policy overrides**.

Below are the clearest “exclusion / not-applicable” categories implied by the guideline’s scope and statements.

## 1) Patients who are not the target population (scope exclusion)
These recommendations are aimed at **major trauma and polytrauma**, especially those in the **post-resuscitation/ICU-requiring** group. Therefore, the guideline is **not designed for**:
- **Minor trauma** patients (low injury severity, no ICU needs, routine ED discharge pathways).
- **Elective surgery** patients (ERAS exists for them, but this document is trauma-specific).
- **Non-trauma critical illness** (e.g., sepsis, medical ICU admissions without traumatic injury).

## 2) Situations where local law/policy determines what can be done (hard exclusion)
Several recommendations (especially around DNAR/DNR and goals-of-care) explicitly require adherence to **local legal policies**. So the guideline cannot be “used” to justify actions that conflict with:
- **Jurisdictional laws** on consent, surrogate decision-making, withdrawal/withholding life-sustaining treatment, or DNAR orders.
- **Institutional policies** (documentation requirements, ethics consult triggers, mandated processes).

In other words, if a recommendation conflicts with local legal/organizational rules, **the local rule prevails**.

## 3) Patients for whom the guideline’s evidence base is weak or not generalizable (soft exclusion / caution)
The authors note that some evidence is **extrapolated** from elective surgery and non-trauma emergency surgery, and that the guideline is **not exhaustive**. That implies caution (and effectively “not applicable as a strict protocol”) in:
- **Highly atypical trauma populations** where standard prognostication/trauma pathways don’t fit (rare mechanisms, unusual comorbidity profiles).
- **Settings with very different resources** than those assumed by a given recommendation (e.g., no access to palliative care teams, no aeromedical transport, no geriatric consult service). The guideline itself says systems must be **locally relevant** and not copied wholesale from high-income country models.

## 4) Pediatric patients: not excluded, but this part is not a pediatric protocol
Children are **not excluded**, but the guideline explicitly states pediatric considerations are only “inserted where appropriate,” and concludes there is limited evidence to mandate pediatric trauma centers outside some high-income settings. Practically:
- If you need **detailed pediatric-specific clinical guidance**, this document is **insufficient** on its own and should not be used as the sole pediatric trauma guideline.

## 5) Patients in whom “ERAS-style” recovery goals are not appropriate because care is primarily palliative
This is not an exclusion from *using the guideline*, but it changes which parts apply. For patients with:
- **Devastating injury** with high likelihood of death,
- Expected **permanent disability** or outcome incompatible with the patient’s wishes,
- Or where **goals-of-care** limit aggressive interventions,

then the “enhanced recovery” framing is not the priority; the applicable sections become the **palliative care, DNAR, and advanced care planning** recommendations rather than aggressive recovery pathways.

## 6) Patients without decision-making capacity where no surrogate/advance directive is available (process limitation)
Not an exclusion, but a major limitation: some recommendations (DNAR reconsideration, shared decision-making, ACP) presume you can identify:
- The patient’s **preferences** (advance directive/living will), or
- A legally valid **surrogate**.

If neither exists, the guideline’s preferred shared decision-making steps may be **delayed or modified** per local law and ethics processes.

---

### Bottom line
There are **no explicit patient-level exclusion criteria** listed in this Part 3 guideline. The main “cannot use as written” situations are:
1) **Not major trauma/polytrauma/ICU-requiring** (outside scope), and  
2) **Any conflict with local legal/institutional policy** (especially DNAR/DNR and end-of-life decisions).  

If you tell me whether you mean **Part 3 only** (ethics/systems) or the **entire 3-part ERATIC guideline**, I can map exclusions more precisely (e.g., clinical contraindications to specific ERAS elements in Parts 1–2).",periop,exclusion_criteria_extraction
PMC6313353.txt,"## TARGET POPULATION (as stated / implied in this guideline)

### 1) Primary target population: **Authors and researchers reporting ERAS studies**
**Extracted target-population text (key passages):**
- “**To improve the quality of ERAS reporting, ERAS® USA and the ERAS® Society launched an effort to create an instrument to assist authors in manuscript preparation.**”
- “**The RECOvER Checklist is intended to provide a standardized framework for the reporting of ERAS-related studies.**”
- “**The checklist can also assist reviewers in evaluating the quality of ERAS-related manuscripts. Authors are encouraged to include the RECOvER Checklist when submitting ERAS-related studies to peer-reviewed journals.**”

**Significant details (what this means in practice):**
- This is **not a clinical care guideline for a patient group**; it is a **reporting guideline/checklist**.
- The “population” is primarily:
  - **Manuscript authors** writing ERAS-related research (any study design).
  - **Researchers/teams** implementing ERAS pathways who are publishing outcomes and compliance.
  - **Peer reviewers/editors** assessing ERAS manuscripts (explicitly mentioned as a use case).

---

### 2) Secondary “population” described: **ERAS study populations (patients undergoing surgery within ERAS pathways)**
This document does **not** define a single patient target population (e.g., a specific disease, stage, age group). Instead, it describes ERAS research as spanning **multiple surgical types** and instructs authors to clearly define their own study populations.

**Extracted text indicating breadth of patient populations:**
- “**ERAS programs have expanded beyond colorectal surgery to other surgical disciplines and have been implemented successfully in pancreatic surgery, thoracic surgery, liver resection, urologic surgery, gynecologic surgery, and emergency surgery, among others.**”
- The checklist development questions include: “**How are the study groups defined?**”
- Methods reporting expectations include: “**selection of patients (item 9) for the study. This includes… inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study.**”
- Results reporting expectations include: “**The reader should be able to visualize the derivation and composition of the study population (item 15). A description of the population should identify what proportion of all patients undergoing the procedure of interest is being reported and the reasons for exclusion from the study.**”

**Significant details (what the guideline requires about patient populations):**
- The guideline expects ERAS manuscripts to report:
  - **Setting/context** (hospital type, etc.)
  - **Timing** (recruitment period; pre-ERAS vs post-ERAS implementation)
  - **Patient selection** including **inclusion/exclusion criteria**
  - **Flow/derivation of the study population** and **reasons for exclusions**
- It emphasizes that ERAS research should link **outcomes** to **actual compliance** with ERAS elements (i.e., the “population” is not just “patients,” but “patients with measured ERAS element compliance”).

---

## Bottom line (Target Population statement you can use)
**TARGET POPULATION:**  
This guideline targets **authors, investigators, and reviewers** involved in **reporting ERAS (Enhanced Recovery After Surgery) research**, across surgical specialties. It provides a standardized checklist for reporting ERAS study design, patient selection (including inclusion/exclusion criteria), compliance auditing, and outcomes. It does **not** define a single clinical patient population; instead, it applies to ERAS studies involving patients undergoing a specified surgical procedure within an ERAS pathway, where the study population and exclusions are explicitly described by the authors.",periop,target_population_extraction
PMC6313353.txt,"The document you quoted (the RECOvER Checklist) is **not a clinical treatment guideline for patients**. It is a **reporting checklist for researchers/authors** writing up ERAS-related studies (i.e., it tells investigators what to report: setting, dates, inclusion/exclusion criteria used, compliance auditing, outcomes definitions, etc.).  

Because of that, **it does not define patient-level “exclusion criteria”** (e.g., “patients with X cannot use ERAS” or “do not apply ERAS to Y”). Instead, it explicitly says that each ERAS study should **report its own** inclusion/exclusion criteria (Item 9) and should show how the study population was derived and why patients were excluded (Item 15).

## So who “cannot use this guideline”?
### 1) Patients are not the intended users
- **Patients are not “included” or “excluded”** from RECOvER, because RECOvER is not something a patient “uses.”
- The intended users are **study authors, investigators, and peer reviewers** reporting ERAS research.

### 2) Studies/manuscripts that are outside scope
A manuscript is effectively “out of scope” for RECOvER if it is **not reporting ERAS-related care pathways and/or ERAS compliance and outcomes**. For example:
- Papers not involving an ERAS pathway (or not evaluating ERAS elements/compliance).
- Papers that discuss perioperative care generally but **do not define an ERAS protocol** or **do not measure/report compliance** with ERAS elements.

### 3) Patient exclusions are procedure- and protocol-specific (not defined by RECOvER)
RECOvER requires authors to *state* exclusions, but it does not prescribe them. In real ERAS clinical guidelines (procedure-specific ERAS Society guidelines), exclusions/limitations often depend on:
- **Surgical procedure** (colorectal vs pancreatic vs thoracic, etc.)
- **Urgency** (elective vs emergency)
- **Patient factors** (frailty, severe comorbidity, inability to participate in early mobilization/oral intake, etc.)
- **Contraindications to specific ERAS elements** (e.g., epidural/neuraxial contraindications, NSAID contraindications, aspiration risk affecting early feeding)

But those are **not listed in RECOvER**, because RECOvER is about *reporting* what was done and to whom, not dictating who should receive ERAS.

## What RECOvER *expects authors to report* about exclusions (where you’ll find them)
If you are trying to identify “which patients were excluded,” RECOvER points you to:
- **Item 9 (Selection of patients):** authors should report inclusion/exclusion criteria.
- **Item 15 (Derivation/composition of study population):** authors should report what proportion of all eligible surgical patients were included and **reasons for exclusion**.

## If you tell me which ERAS clinical guideline you mean, I can list true patient exclusion criteria
If your real question is “Which patients should not be managed with ERAS?” that depends on the **specific ERAS Society clinical guideline** (e.g., ERAS for colorectal surgery, pancreaticoduodenectomy, cesarean delivery, etc.). Share the procedure/guideline name (or paste the relevant section), and I’ll extract and explain the actual patient-level exclusions/contraindications.",periop,exclusion_criteria_extraction
PMC12240022.txt,"## TARGET POPULATION (extracted from the guideline text)

This guideline is written for **patients receiving direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)** and for clinicians managing DOAC use in common real-world scenarios (prescribing, lab testing when needed, peri‑procedural interruption/resumption, and bleeding/reversal).

Because the document is a **practical guidance** rather than a single-disease guideline, the “target population” is best represented as **multiple target sub-populations** addressed throughout the text.

---

## 1) Patients for whom DOACs are being prescribed (core population)
**Target population text (from guideline):**
- DOAC efficacy is established in RCTs involving patients with:
  - **Atrial fibrillation (AF)**
  - **Chronic stable atherosclerotic disease**
  - **Venous thromboembolism (VTE)** including **deep vein thrombosis (DVT)** and **pulmonary embolism (PE)**

**Indication-focused population (explicitly listed):**
- In Australia and New Zealand, apixaban, rivaroxaban and dabigatran are indicated for:
  - **Prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in AF**
  - **Chronic stable atherosclerotic disease**
  - **Treatment of new DVT and PE**
  - **Secondary prevention of VTE**
  - **Prevention of venous thrombosis in hip and knee arthroplasty**

**Significant details/constraints mentioned:**
- DOAC clearance relies primarily on **renal function** (varies by agent).
- DOACs have fewer interactions than warfarin, but important interactions occur via **P‑glycoprotein and/or CYP3A4**.
- Combining **antiplatelet drugs** with DOACs increases bleeding risk.

---

## 2) Patients with renal impairment (special population repeatedly addressed)
**Target population text (from guideline):**
- “A careful assessment of risk–benefit should be undertaken for use of DOACs in patients with **CrCl <30 mL/min**.”
- Australia/NZ specifics:
  - **Dabigatran**: dose adjustment recommended with **CrCl ≤50 mL/min**; **contraindicated if CrCl ≤30 mL/min**
  - **Apixaban**: “not recommended with **CrCl <25 mL/min**”
  - **Rivaroxaban**: “not recommended with **CrCl <15 mL/min**”

**Perioperative/lab-testing subgroup (renal impairment where testing may matter):**
- Anti‑Xa levels prior to surgery are “generally not necessary except” in:
  - **FXa inhibitors**: **CKD stage 4 (CrCl 15–29 mL/min or less)**
  - **Dabigatran**: **Stage 3a, CrCl ≤45–59 mL/min**

---

## 3) Patients with liver dysfunction (special population)
**Target population text (from guideline):**
- “DOACs should also be used cautiously in patients with **liver dysfunction**.”
- Specific restrictions listed:
  - **Apixaban**: contraindicated in **Child‑Pugh C**
  - **Rivaroxaban**: contraindicated in **Child‑Pugh B and C**
  - **Dabigatran**: not recommended with **liver enzymes ×2 upper limit of normal**

---

## 4) Patients at extremes of body weight (special population)
**Target population text (from guideline):**
- DOAC use “remains challenging” in:
  - **low‑body‑weight** patients
  - **morbidly obese** patients

(Details are flagged as a concern area; the excerpt does not provide dosing rules beyond noting the challenge.)

---

## 5) Patients in whom DOAC level testing may be warranted (testing-targeted population)
**Target population text (from guideline):**
- DOACs “do not routinely require laboratory monitoring…”
- However, measurement may be relevant in “clinical circumstances” (referred to as Box 2 in the text) where knowing anticoagulant effect could change management.

**Important interpretive detail included:**
- Normal **aPTT/PT** does **not** exclude clinically relevant DOAC levels (up to **100–150 ng/mL**).
- Drug-specific assays mentioned:
  - **Dabigatran**: dilute thrombin time (TT), ecarin clotting time
  - **Apixaban/rivaroxaban**: calibrated anti‑FXa chromogenic assays

---

## 6) Patients presenting with bleeding while receiving a DOAC (bleeding-management population)
**Target population text (from guideline):**
- “General principles in management of patients with bleeding while receiving DOACs…”
- Applies to patients with **minor bleeding** through **major/life‑threatening bleeding**.

**Significant details included:**
- DOAC should be **ceased at least temporarily** in all with significant bleeding.
- Consider reversal for “**major, life‑threatening** bleeding”:
  - **Idarucizumab** for dabigatran
  - **Andexanet‑alfa** for apixaban/rivaroxaban
  - If unavailable: **PCC/aPCC** may be considered
- Reversal/haemostatic agents are “unlikely to improve outcome” below drug-level thresholds:
  - Dabigatran level **<50 ng/mL**
  - Rivaroxaban/apixaban level **<75 ng/mL**
- Dabigatran is removable by **haemodialysis** (rarely used due to idarucizumab availability).

---

## 7) Patients needing urgent/time‑critical or elective procedures while on a DOAC (perioperative population)
**Target population text (from guideline):**
- “Up to **10%** of patients receiving long‑term anticoagulants require **urgent or time‑critical procedures** each year.”
- Guidance includes interruption/resumption for **elective surgery** and special situations (e.g., neuraxial anesthesia).

**Significant details included:**
- DOACs can be interrupted for planned procedures **without bridging** with LMWH.
- Interruption schedules depend on:
  - DOAC type/dose
  - **Bleeding risk of procedure** (low/moderate vs high)
  - **Renal function** (especially for dabigatran)
- Neuraxial anesthesia: recommends **72‑hour interruption** of FXa inhibitors or until FXa level **<30 ng/mL**.
- Resumption:
  - Therapeutic doses can be resumed **48–72 h** after high-bleeding-risk surgery
  - Prophylactic anticoagulation may be used until therapeutic DOAC restarted

### If you want, I can reformat this into a single “TARGET POPULATION” block (like your examples)
Tell me whether you want it framed as:
1) one consolidated target population statement, or  
2) separate target population statements per scenario (prescribing / bleeding / perioperative / renal-liver impairment).",periop,target_population_extraction
PMC12240022.txt,"The guideline is written for **adults being treated with the three DOACs available in Australia/New Zealand (apixaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran)** for the common approved indications (AF, VTE treatment/secondary prevention, post–hip/knee arthroplasty prophylaxis, and selected atherosclerotic disease indications). It is **not intended to be applied** (or says DOAC use is “not advised”) in several important patient groups—either because DOACs are contraindicated, not recommended, or evidence is insufficient.

Below are the key **exclusion / “do not use this guidance as-is”** scenarios (i.e., patients in whom DOACs are generally not appropriate, so a DOAC-focused guideline won’t apply, or needs specialist input).

---

## 1) Severe renal impairment (below product/guideline thresholds)
Because DOAC clearance depends on kidney function, the guideline flags that DOACs are **not recommended/contraindicated at low creatinine clearance (CrCl)**:

- **Apixaban:** *not recommended* if **CrCl < 25 mL/min**  
- **Dabigatran:** *not recommended/contraindicated* if **CrCl < 30 mL/min** (and dose adjustment is needed already at higher CrCl cutoffs in AU/NZ)  
- **Rivaroxaban:** *not recommended* if **CrCl < 15 mL/min**

Practical implication: patients with **advanced CKD (especially stage 4–5) or dialysis** often fall outside the evidence base used for standard DOAC protocols; management usually requires specialist/individualised decisions (often warfarin or parenteral options instead).

---

## 2) Significant hepatic impairment / liver disease (Child–Pugh restrictions)
The guideline cautions against DOACs in clinically significant liver dysfunction, with drug-specific exclusions:

- **Apixaban:** **contraindicated in Child–Pugh C**
- **Rivaroxaban:** **contraindicated in Child–Pugh B and C**
- **Dabigatran:** not advised when **liver enzymes are >2× upper limit of normal** (per the box note you quoted)

Rationale: altered synthesis of clotting factors, impaired drug metabolism/transport, and higher bleeding risk make DOAC exposure and effect less predictable.

---

## 3) Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), especially “triple-positive”
The guideline’s “not advised” box includes **APS**—identified by the antibody profile:
- **Lupus anticoagulant**
- **Anticardiolipin antibodies**
- **Anti–β2 glycoprotein I antibodies**

In practice, DOACs are generally avoided particularly in **high-risk APS (triple-positive and/or arterial events)** because trials have shown worse thrombotic outcomes compared with warfarin in these groups.

---

## 4) Extremes of body weight where evidence is limited (caution/individualisation)
The text notes DOAC use is “challenging” in:
- **Low body weight**
- **Morbid obesity**

This is less an absolute “never,” and more: standard dosing/expected drug levels may be less reliable, and some patients may need alternative anticoagulation or drug-level–guided decisions.

---

## 5) Patients taking interacting drugs where safe DOAC use cannot be ensured
While DOACs have fewer interactions than warfarin, the guideline highlights clinically important interactions via:
- **P-glycoprotein (P-gp)**
- **CYP3A4**

Patients on **strong inhibitors/inducers** (or combinations increasing bleeding risk, e.g., **concurrent antiplatelets**) may fall outside “routine” DOAC pathways if interactions can’t be mitigated (dose changes, switching agents, or choosing warfarin may be required).

---

## 6) Indications not covered / where DOACs are not appropriate (scope exclusions)
Even if not fully listed in your excerpt, a DOAC practical guideline like this generally **does not apply** to patients anticoagulated for conditions where DOACs are not recommended/approved or have poor evidence, such as:
- **Mechanical heart valves** (DOACs contraindicated; warfarin standard)
- **Moderate–severe rheumatic mitral stenosis** (“valvular AF” where warfarin is typically preferred)
- Other uncommon hypercoagulable states where evidence is sparse (case-by-case)

(If you want, I can cross-check the full paper’s Box 1 wording if you share the exact Box 1 list/page.)

---

## 7) Paediatrics and pregnancy/breastfeeding (typically outside scope)
This document is aimed at adult practice in AU/NZ. DOACs are generally **not first-line in pregnancy** and many guidelines avoid them in **breastfeeding**; paediatric use is specialised and not usually covered by adult perioperative/bleeding algorithms.

---

### Summary (who “cannot use” this guideline as a standard DOAC pathway)
Patients with **(a)** renal function below the drug-specific CrCl cutoffs, **(b)** significant liver disease per Child–Pugh restrictions / marked transaminitis, or **(c)** **antiphospholipid syndrome**, are the clearest “DOAC not advised” groups explicitly flagged. In addition, patients with **extreme body weight**, **unmanageable drug interactions**, or **non-DOAC indications** (e.g., mechanical valves) should not be managed using the guideline’s routine DOAC prescribing/interruption/reversal pathways without specialist individualisation.

If you tell me which DOAC (apixaban/rivaroxaban/dabigatran) and the patient’s **CrCl, Child–Pugh class, APS status, weight, and interacting meds**, I can map them precisely to “in-scope vs out-of-scope” for this guideline.",periop,exclusion_criteria_extraction
PMC12687548.txt,"## TARGET POPULATION (extracted from the guideline text)

### Overall / primary target population (who the guideline is for)
- **Children and adolescents with diabetes mellitus** who are in the **periprocedural / perioperative period** (i.e., undergoing procedures requiring anesthesia/sedation and related fasting and perioperative management).
- The guideline is written for use across **Australasian healthcare settings** (e.g., tertiary hospitals with endocrinology support, secondary hospitals led by general paediatrics, and private hospitals), and is intended to support multidisciplinary perioperative care.

**Key contextual details that define the population and setting**
- The periprocedural period is highlighted as a **high-risk time** for **hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia** due to **fasting, acute illness, nausea/vomiting, pain**, and the complexity of modern diabetes regimens/technologies.
- The guideline explicitly anticipates variability in staffing and resources (e.g., care may involve **house officers, paediatric registrars**, and access to **high-dependency/ICU/PICU** may vary).

---

## Segmented target populations within scope (subgroups explicitly addressed)

### 1) Children/adolescents with diabetes undergoing **elective vs emergency** procedures
- **Elective procedures**: planned in advance; the child is well beforehand; a perioperative plan is established prior to the day of surgery.
- **Emergency (non-elective/acute/urgent) procedures**: cannot be delayed; may be minor or major.

**Significant details**
- The guideline stresses that the perioperative plan should be **individualised** and clarified with the **anaesthetist and surgical team** when procedure classification is uncertain.

---

### 2) Children/adolescents with diabetes undergoing **minor vs major** procedures
- **Minor procedures (< 2 hours)**: brief GA/heavy sedation, rapid recovery expected, able to eat by next meal (within **2–4 hours**), usually **same-day discharge**.
- **Major procedures (> 2 hours)**: prolonged surgery/investigations, **not discharged same day**, higher risk of postoperative nausea/vomiting and/or inability to eat adequately for a significant time.

**Significant details**
- This classification drives whether the guideline recommends continuing diabetes technologies (where feasible) and how IV fluids/insulin are managed.

---

### 3) Children/adolescents with diabetes using **diabetes technologies**
This guideline repeatedly identifies technology users as a key subgroup:
- Those using **continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)**
- Those using **insulin pumps**
- Those using **automated insulin delivery (AID)** systems (pump + CGM algorithm)

**Significant details**
- For **minor procedures**, the guideline recommends using **existing CGM and/or pump where possible**, supported by **Pump and CGM checklists** (Appendices A and B).
- It notes important constraints (e.g., **pumps cannot be used during CT or MRI**; CGM use has limitations in some operative contexts such as **diathermy**).

---

### 4) Children/adolescents with **Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D)** in the periprocedural period
The guideline includes a “special situations” section for:
- **Adolescents/young people with T2D**, particularly because of increasing medication variety.

**Significant details**
- It specifically flags medication-related perioperative risks (e.g., **SGLT-2 inhibitors** and risk of **euglycaemic ketoacidosis**; **GLP-1 agonists** and aspiration/fasting considerations; withholding other oral agents the morning of surgery).

---

### 5) Children/adolescents on specific insulin regimens with distinct perioperative risk
A specific subgroup is called out:
- Those using **NPH insulins** (e.g., **Humulin-N® or Protaphane®**)

**Significant details**
- They are identified as having **higher hypoglycaemia risk** due to later peak action, and the guideline provides distinct perioperative recommendations (e.g., dose reduction for minor procedures; omission for major procedures with IV management).

---

## Practical “in-scope” definition (compiled from the guideline’s wording)
Putting the guideline’s statements together, the target population can be summarized as:

**Children and adolescents with diabetes mellitus (including those on injections, pumps, CGM, and automated insulin delivery, and including those with type 2 diabetes on modern glucose-lowering agents) who are undergoing minor or major procedures—elective or emergency—during which fasting, anesthesia/sedation, and perioperative care place them at increased risk of hypo- or hyperglycaemia and related complications.**

If you upload the PDF or provide the section headings/page numbers, I can also extract the exact “Target population” phrasing verbatim (if it exists as a labeled section) and map it to each subgroup above.",periop,target_population_extraction
PMC12687548.txt,"This guideline is written for **children and adolescents with diabetes mellitus** who are undergoing **procedures requiring fasting, sedation, or anaesthesia**. It is broad, but there are clear situations where it **should not be used as-is** (or where key parts of it—especially CGM/pump pathways—are **explicitly not applicable**), and the patient should instead be managed using **specialist/setting-specific protocols** (anaesthesia, radiology, ICU, DKA pathways, etc.).

Below are the practical **exclusion / “do not use this guideline without modification”** groups, based on what the document states or implies.

---

## 1) Patients who are not “children or adolescents”
- The scope is **paediatric**. Adults (including young adults managed in adult services) should use adult perioperative diabetes guidance.

---

## 2) Patients/procedures where **CGM and/or insulin pump use is not allowed**
The guideline supports using existing CGM/pump “where possible” for **minor procedures**, but it also lists situations where these devices **cannot** be used (so the pump/CGM-based parts of the guideline do not apply):

### A. **MRI or CT**
- **Insulin pumps cannot be used during CT or MRI scans** (explicitly stated).
- CGM devices have **variable manufacturer requirements** for radiology; for MRI in particular, many systems require removal. The guideline says to follow **manufacturer guidance**.

### B. **Diathermy (electrocautery)**
- The guideline states **CGM devices should not be used if diathermy is required**.
- In those cases, rely on **capillary/venous glucose monitoring** and use non-CGM pathways.

### C. Any setting where the device cannot be kept safe/visible/connected
Even if not “forbidden,” the guideline cautions that CGM accuracy/utility may be compromised when:
- the sensor will be **compressed** (compression artefact),
- the receiver (often a phone) cannot remain **connected/unlocked/within range**,
- medication interference is likely (it lists several drugs that *may* affect accuracy),
- the device would be in the **direct x‑ray field** (it advises shielding/avoidance).

In these situations, you should not follow CGM-driven decision-making and should default to **hourly (or more frequent) blood glucose checks** and standard insulin/IV fluid approaches.

---

## 3) Patients undergoing **major surgery** where “minor-procedure/pump continuation” pathways are inappropriate
The guideline distinguishes:
- **Minor procedures (<2 h, rapid recovery, eating within 2–4 h, usually day stay)** vs
- **Major procedures (>2 h, not day stay, higher PONV risk, or unable to eat adequately post-op)**

For many **major procedures**, the “keep pump/CGM running” approach is often not appropriate; management typically shifts to **IV fluids ± IV insulin infusion** with close monitoring. So while the guideline still applies overall, **the minor-procedure technology pathways are effectively excluded**.

---

## 4) Patients with **diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or significant ketosis requiring DKA pathways**
The guideline includes a hyperglycaemia/ketone response (e.g., ketones ≥1 mmol/L → IV fluids + insulin), but it is **not a full DKA management protocol**.

So if the child/adolescent is:
- in **DKA**, or
- clinically unwell with metabolic derangement where a formal DKA pathway/ICU-level protocol is required,

then this guideline should not be used as the primary management document; use your institution’s **DKA/critical care** protocols and involve paediatric endocrinology/ICU.

---

## 5) Patients using diabetes medications where peri-anaesthetic risk management must be led by anaesthesia/specialist protocols (Type 2 diabetes “special situations”)
The guideline does cover T2D, but it also flags medication classes where peri-procedural management may require **additional, non-standard precautions**:

- **SGLT-2 inhibitors**: must be withheld (it recommends **2 days prior and day of procedure**) due to **euglycaemic ketoacidosis risk**. If this hasn’t occurred, the planned pathway may not be safe.
- **GLP-1 receptor agonists**: it notes **no consensus** and that **extended fasting up to 24 h may be indicated**; for urgent procedures, aspiration-risk mitigation must be discussed with the **anaesthetist**.
- **Metformin**: should be withheld morning of surgery; lactic acidosis risk is highlighted especially with renal disease.

Practically: if a patient is on these agents and the required withholding/fasting/aspiration-risk plan cannot be met, the guideline cannot be applied “routinely” and needs **anaesthetic-led individualisation**.

---

## 6) Patients in whom the guideline’s assumptions cannot be met (safety/monitoring/resource exclusions)
The guideline assumes you can do things like:
- **hourly intra-procedure glucose checks** (or every 30 min when changing insulin),
- ketone testing when glucose is high,
- safe IV fluid/insulin infusion prescribing and monitoring (including electrolytes for major surgery),
- multidisciplinary input when needed.

If the setting cannot provide this level of monitoring (e.g., no ability to check glucose frequently, no staff familiar with IV insulin infusions, no access to appropriate paediatric escalation), then the guideline should not be used without escalation/transfer to a facility that can meet these requirements.

---

### If you want, tell me the exact patient group you’re screening (age range, T1D vs T2D, pump/CGM use, and procedure type), and I can translate the above into a short “include/exclude” checklist for your service.",periop,exclusion_criteria_extraction
PMC11455680.txt,"## TARGET POPULATION (extracted from the provided guideline text)

### Primary target population (overall scope)
**Patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) who have *localized* disease that is classified as:**
- **Borderline-resectable PDAC (BR-PDAC)**, and
- **Locally advanced PDAC (LA-PDAC)**

The guideline is specifically framed around **selection and perioperative care** and presents a **management algorithm** for these two groups.

**Key defining features used in the document to describe this population:**
- Disease is discussed in the context of **localized PDAC**, which the text states is classified into **resectable, borderline resectable, and locally advanced** categories.
- BR-PDAC and LA-PDAC are described as being defined traditionally by **degree of vascular involvement** and the **probability of achieving a margin-negative (R0) resection**.
- The guideline emphasizes a modern selection approach incorporating:
  - **Anatomic resectability**
  - **Biologic resectability** (notably using **CA 19-9** as a key marker)
  - **Conditional resectability** (patient fitness/comorbidities)
  - These are referenced as the **A, B, C criteria** and tied to a **“prognosis-based resectability”** approach.

---

## Segmented target populations within the guideline (subgroups explicitly discussed)

### 1) Borderline-resectable PDAC (BR-PDAC)
**Target subgroup:** Patients with **BR-PDAC** being considered for treatment pathways that may include **neoadjuvant therapy and/or surgery**, with selection influenced by tumor biology and patient condition.

**Significant details from the text:**
- BR-PDAC is repeatedly paired with LA-PDAC as a focus of the algorithm and recommendations.
- The guideline notes that **upfront surgery may improve survival in BR-PDAC** *when multi-agent neoadjuvant chemotherapy cannot be delivered* (this is stated as acknowledged by the REDISCOVER guidelines).

**Implied boundaries (from the text):**
- This is still within **localized PDAC** (not metastatic at presentation in the standard framing).
- Selection is not purely anatomic; **biology and patient fitness** are part of candidacy.

---

### 2) Locally advanced PDAC (LA-PDAC)
**Target subgroup:** Patients with **LA-PDAC**, including those who may be considered for **resection after systemic therapy** under a **prognosis-based** framework.

**Significant details from the text:**
- The guideline states it **recommends LA-PDAC resection in carefully selected patients**.
- It highlights that current LA-PDAC definitions are problematic and need revision because they may group together tumors that are “difficult” vs “impossible” to resect.
- It notes a definitional issue where **LA-PDAC may include “unreconstructible superior mesenteric/portal vein”**, making tumors “unresectable by definition,” which conflicts with a biology/response-based approach.

**Selection factors emphasized:**
- **Tumor biology** is prioritized over anatomy.
- **CA 19-9** is discussed as prognostic and relevant to predicting probability of radical resection.
- **Performance status/physiologic status** and comorbidities are explicitly part of decision-making (conditional resectability).

---

### 3) LA-PDAC patients considered for complex arterial surgery (SMA resection/reconstruction)
**Target subgroup:** **Carefully selected LA-PDAC patients** in whom **pancreatectomy with resection and reconstruction of the superior mesenteric artery (PRR-SMA)** might be contemplated.

**Significant details from the text:**
- The guideline discussion states **PRR-SMA could not be recommended** due to lack of consensus, despite substantial Delphi support.
- It specifies this should occur only in **centers with specific skills and experience**, with data captured in registries/prospective studies.
- It suggests referral to expert centers should be considered rather than denying surgery solely due to lack of local experience.

---

### 4) LA-PDAC patients fit for surgery but unable to receive multi-agent neoadjuvant chemotherapy
**Target subgroup:** LA-PDAC patients who are **surgically fit** but **cannot receive multi-agent neoadjuvant/primary chemotherapy**.

**Significant details from the text:**
- The guideline notes evidence for neoadjuvant benefit largely comes from **multi-agent regimens**, and **not all patients can receive them**.
- For LA-PDAC specifically, the guideline **could not recommend upfront surgery** in this scenario; it states that if multi-agent therapy cannot be delivered, **proceeding with resection does not appear to provide a clear oncologic advantage**.
- It emphasizes maximizing efforts to enable delivery of multi-agent therapy.

---

### 5) LA-PDAC patients with persistently elevated or rising CA 19-9 after neoadjuvant therapy
**Target subgroup:** LA-PDAC patients who, **after neoadjuvant oncology therapies**, have **CA 19-9 that does not decrease or rises**.

**Significant details from the text:**
- The text states CA 19-9 predicts probability of radical resection and has prognostic implications.
- It notes that after neoadjuvant therapy, CA 19-9 **does not decrease or rises in ~10%** of patients (as stated in the excerpt).
- This subgroup is flagged as an unresolved/important management question area.

---

### 6) BR-PDAC and LA-PDAC patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy (question of number of cycles)
**Target subgroup:** BR-PDAC and LA-PDAC patients planned for surgery after **neoadjuvant chemotherapy**, where the **optimal number of cycles** is uncertain.

**Significant details from the text:**
- The guideline states there is **no agreement** on ideal number of cycles pre-resection.
- It cites NCCN ranges (e.g., **≥4–6 cycles** for common regimens; special note for BRCA-mutated with gemcitabine/cisplatin **≥2–6**).
- It notes uncertainty about the impact of **dose reductions** on selecting surgical candidates.

---

### 7) LA-PDAC patients considered for chemotherapy vs chemoradiotherapy strategies (including consolidation RT)
**Target subgroup:** LA-PDAC patients being treated with:
- **Primary chemotherapy**, or
- **Primary chemoradiotherapy**, or
- **Chemotherapy followed by consolidation radiotherapy**, potentially leading to surgery in selected cases.

**Significant details from the text:**
- Chemotherapy is described as typically favored for systemic control/downstaging.
- Chemoradiotherapy may improve local response/downstaging/margins but **does not seem to improve overall survival** and increases grade 3–4 adverse events (per cited meta-analysis).
- Some patients may undergo surgery after consolidation RT if stable and clinically well, but surgery is **technically more complex** due to scarring.

---

### 8) BR-PDAC and LA-PDAC patients considered for timing of surgery after chemoradiotherapy
**Target subgroup:** BR-PDAC and LA-PDAC patients who have completed **neoadjuvant or primary chemoradiotherapy** and are being evaluated for **when** to proceed to surgery.

**Significant details from the text:**
- Optimal timing is described as **unsettled**.
- A study is cited suggesting benefit with prolonging interval (with continued chemotherapy) up to **20 weeks**, but no consensus exists.

---

### 9) LA-PDAC patients with oligometastatic disease (research/definition gap)
**Target subgroup (discussed as an emerging/uncertain area):** LA-PDAC patients with **oligometastasis** (limited number/sites of metastases).

**Significant details from the text:**
- Once metastases are visible, PDAC is typically treated as systemic with chemotherapy.
- Oligometastasis is introduced as a concept where local treatments might help in selected cancers; in PDAC, lung metastases may be less aggressive and **resection of isolated lung metastases** is described as already considered an option in carefully selected PDAC patients.
- For **LA-PDAC**, oligometastasis is stated as not well explored; the guideline calls for future studies to define it and clarify prognostic/treatment implications.

---

If you upload the actual PDF/image of the guideline (or share the section headings/pages), I can extract the **verbatim “Target Population” wording** (if present as a labeled section) and map it to these subgroups.",periop,target_population_extraction
PMC11455680.txt,"The REDISCOVER document is a **surgical/perioperative management guideline specifically for patients with *localized* pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) that is either borderline‑resectable (BR‑PDAC) or locally advanced (LA‑PDAC)**. So the main “exclusion criteria” are patients who **do not have BR‑PDAC/LA‑PDAC**, or who **cannot reasonably follow the pathway the guideline assumes (multidisciplinary staging, neoadjuvant intent, potential major pancreatectomy/vascular resection, etc.)**.

Below are the practical groups of patients who **cannot use** (or should not be managed *according to*) this guideline.

---

## 1) Patients who do not have the target disease entity
### A. Not PDAC
The guideline is for **ductal adenocarcinoma**. It does **not** apply to other pancreatic tumors, which have different biology and treatment:
- Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs)
- Acinar cell carcinoma
- Solid pseudopapillary neoplasm
- Ampullary cancer, distal cholangiocarcinoma, duodenal cancer
- Metastases to the pancreas from other primaries
- Cystic neoplasms without invasive PDAC (e.g., IPMN without invasive carcinoma)

### B. Resectable PDAC (clearly resectable at diagnosis)
If the tumor is **straightforwardly resectable** by standard criteria, the REDISCOVER BR/LA algorithm is not the intended pathway (these patients follow “resectable PDAC” guidelines, where upfront surgery is often considered).

---

## 2) Patients with metastatic/systemic disease at presentation (or discovered on staging)
REDISCOVER is built around **localized** BR/LA disease. Patients with:
- **Distant metastases** (liver, peritoneum, bone, non-regional nodes, etc.)
- **Malignant ascites/peritoneal carcinomatosis**
- **Positive staging laparoscopy for metastasis** (if performed)

…are generally **outside the scope**, because the disease is treated as systemic and managed primarily with systemic therapy/palliation rather than curative-intent pancreatectomy.

**Important nuance:** the paper discusses “oligometastasis” as an *unanswered question/future research area*, meaning **it is not an endorsed, guideline-based indication**. So patients with oligometastatic disease are effectively **not covered** by the guideline as a standard pathway.

---

## 3) Patients with “unresectable by definition” anatomy (as currently defined)
The manuscript explicitly notes a contradiction in current LA definitions and highlights that some tumors are labeled unresectable regardless of biology/response. In current practice, patients with:
- **Unreconstructible SMV/portal vein involvement** (classified as unresectable in many anatomic definitions)

are typically **not candidates for curative resection** under standard definitions, and therefore fall outside what the guideline can reliably direct (the paper argues this definition may need revision, but that is not yet resolved).

---

## 4) Patients for whom the key recommended treatment components cannot be delivered
REDISCOVER emphasizes **tumor biology and response to modern systemic therapy**. Therefore, patients who cannot undergo the expected oncologic pathway are not well served by the algorithm.

### A. LA‑PDAC patients fit for surgery but **unable to receive multi‑agent neoadjuvant chemotherapy**
The paper explicitly states the guideline **could not recommend** upfront surgery for this LA subgroup (unlike some BR cases). So for LA‑PDAC patients who cannot receive multi-agent regimens (e.g., due to frailty, organ dysfunction), the guideline does **not** provide a clear endorsed alternative pathway—meaning they are **not good candidates to “use the guideline” as a directive**.

### B. Patients unable to access required multidisciplinary staging/monitoring
If a setting cannot provide:
- High-quality pancreas-protocol CT/MRI interpretation
- CA19‑9 assessment/interpretation (with awareness of limitations)
- Multidisciplinary tumor board evaluation
- Experienced pancreatic surgery/vascular reconstruction support

…then applying the guideline as written is unsafe or not feasible.

---

## 5) Patients in whom surgery is not appropriate because of condition (“conditional resectability” failure)
Even if the tumor is BR/LA, the guideline’s surgical pathway presumes the patient can tolerate major surgery (often with vascular resection). Patients generally **should not** proceed on this pathway if they have:
- Poor performance status / severe frailty
- Prohibitive cardiopulmonary comorbidity or other major operative contraindications
- Inability to recover from major abdominal surgery (e.g., severe malnutrition not correctable, uncontrolled infection, etc.)

The paper stresses that when **technical complexity + limited physiologic reserve + intermediate/poor biology** coexist, resection should be discouraged even if technically feasible.

---

## 6) Patients requiring procedures the guideline did **not** endorse as standard of care
These are not “patients excluded from care,” but they are **excluded from guideline-supported indications**:

### A. Tumors requiring **superior mesenteric artery (SMA) resection/reconstruction**
Pancreatectomy with SMA resection (PRR‑SMA) **was not recommended/endorsed** due to lack of consensus. So patients whose only route to resection would be SMA resection are **not covered by an endorsed recommendation** (may be considered only in highly specialized centers/registries).

### B. Patients considered for **ablation therapies** as definitive local treatment
Irreversible electroporation and other ablation modalities are described as **investigational** with no established role—so patients seeking ablation as a guideline-based alternative are **outside** the guideline’s supported management.

---

## 7) Patients in whom CA19‑9 cannot be used meaningfully (biologic stratification limitation)
Because REDISCOVER elevates “biology” (often operationalized with **CA19‑9 trends/response**) in decision-making, patients in whom CA19‑9 is uninterpretable are not ideal fits for the biologic algorithm, for example:
- **Lewis antigen–negative** patients (do not produce CA19‑9)
- Marked cholestasis/biliary obstruction where CA19‑9 is spuriously elevated and not corrected/normalized

These patients are not “forbidden,” but the guideline’s biologic selection logic is **less applicable** and requires alternative biomarkers/clinical judgment.

---

### If you want, tell me the patient scenario (resectable vs BR vs LA, vessel involvement, CA19‑9 status, performance status, metastatic workup), and I can map it to: **(a) clearly within REDISCOVER scope, (b) partially addressed/uncertain, or (c) outside scope**.",periop,exclusion_criteria_extraction

**Patients with gastrointestinal “bypass-type” anatomy** (explicitly including **Roux-en-Y gastric bypass [RYGB]** and **duodenal switch [DS]**, “etc.”) who are **undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy** (includes **elective and urgent** cases).

**Source text:**
- “patients with gastrointestinal bypass-type anatomy (RYGB and DS, etc.) undergoing cholecystectomy”
- “The panel suggests routine intraoperative imaging of the biliary anatomy in patients with bypass-type anatomy undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy…”
- “Both elective and urgent laparoscopic cholecystectomies were included in this question.”

**Important qualifiers/subgroups explicitly mentioned:**
- Recommendation is **stronger** when there are **preoperative biochemical or imaging findings suggestive of common bile duct (CBD) stones**.
- It may be **reasonable to omit IOC** when **preoperative MRCP shows no evidence of CBD stones**.

---

## Target population segment 2 (KQ2): GERD after sleeve gastrectomy

### TARGET POPULATION (KQ2)
**Patients who have gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) after sleeve gastrectomy**, particularly those being considered for **medical vs surgical management**, including those with **medically refractory GERD**.

**Source text:**
- “patients with GERD post-sleeve gastrectomy”
- “Nearly every patient with GERD following sleeve gastrectomy will trial medical therapy prior to discussing surgical revision…”

**Key subgroup stratification explicitly used in the guideline (BMI-based):**
- **Medically refractory GERD + BMI > 35:** panel suggests **conversion to RYGB**.
- **Medically refractory GERD + BMI < 35:** guideline states data are **unclear** whether **RYGB vs magnetic sphincter augmentation (MSA)** is superior.
- **BMI 30–35:** consider **gastric bypass** especially if **associated metabolic diseases**; also notes **patients of Asian descent** in this BMI range may derive greater benefit from bypass due to metabolic risk at lower BMI thresholds.
- **BMI < 30:** potential antireflux options include **MSA** and **procedures that include gastric diversion**; malnutrition risk must be discussed if considering bypass.

**Anatomic qualifier:**
- If a **hiatal hernia** is present, it **should be surgically repaired**; in select cases **hiatal hernia repair alone** may be sufficient.

**Process-of-care qualifier:**
- Patients considering a **second metabolic operation** should be evaluated **multidisciplinarily**, and “standard contraindications to gastric bypass still apply,” including psychosocial risks for malnutrition/nutrient deficiency.

---

## Target population segment 3 (KQ3): Obesity + inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) considering bariatric surgery

### TARGET POPULATION (KQ3)
**Obese patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)** who are **undergoing or being considered for metabolic and bariatric surgery**, specifically when choosing between **sleeve gastrectomy vs Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB)**.

**Source text:**
- “obese patients with IBD undergoing metabolic and bariatric surgery”
- “The panel suggests sleeve gastrectomy rather than bypass for obese patients with IBD…”

**IBD-related qualifiers explicitly mentioned:**
- Evidence base was too limited to distinguish:
  - **Ulcerative colitis vs Crohn’s disease**
  - **Active vs quiescent disease**
- Recommendation may be **stronger** in patients who are:
  - **Immunosuppressed**, and/or
  - Have had **prior small bowel resections**
- Situations where **greater consideration may be given to RYGB**:
  - **Very high BMI**
  - **Concomitant GERD**
  - **Quiescent IBD**
- Surgical-planning qualifier for ulcerative colitis:
  - Patients who may later undergo **proctocolectomy** and be considered for **ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA)**—the guideline notes this is “not a straightforward decision” in patients with **RYGB**.

**Care model qualifier:**
- These patients require “extensive multidisciplinary discussion,” including **colorectal surgeons** and **gastroenterologists** familiar with IBD natural history.

---

## Target audience (not the same as target population, but stated in the guideline)
The guideline also states its intended users include: **surgeons, GI specialists, physicians/allied health providers caring for bariatric patients, and patients themselves**; and that **policy makers/insurers** may also consider the recommendations.",periop,target_population_extraction
PMC11666733.txt,"These SAGES guidelines are **not written as a “who is eligible for bariatric surgery” document**, so they do **not** contain a single, explicit “exclusion criteria” list the way a clinical trial would. Instead, they apply only to **three very specific clinical scenarios** (the 3 key questions). Patients who fall **outside those scenarios**, or who have **contraindications to the proposed interventions**, are effectively “out of scope” (i.e., you should not apply these recommendations without additional guidance).

Below are the practical exclusion/out‑of‑scope groups, organized by key question, plus cross-cutting exclusions.

---

## 1) KQ1 (Routine intraoperative cholangiography/imaging during cholecystectomy)
**Recommendation scope:** patients with **bypass-type anatomy** (e.g., **Roux-en-Y gastric bypass [RYGB]**, **duodenal switch [DS]**, similar) who are undergoing **laparoscopic cholecystectomy**.

### Patients who cannot use / are out of scope
1. **No bypass-type anatomy**
   - Patients with **normal anatomy** (no bariatric surgery)
   - Patients with **sleeve gastrectomy** only (not bypass-type)
   - Patients with other non–bypass reconstructions where the “ERCP is difficult later” rationale may not apply the same way

2. **Not undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy**
   - **Open cholecystectomy** cases (not addressed)
   - Non-operative management of gallbladder disease (not addressed)

3. **Situations where IOC is reasonably omitted (explicitly noted by the guideline)**
   - If **preoperative MRCP shows no CBD stones**, the guideline states it may be reasonable to **omit IOC**.
   - If the team **cannot perform IOC** due to access/experience, the guideline suggests **alternative intraoperative biliary imaging** (ultrasound, fluorescence). In other words, the “routine IOC” recommendation may not be usable in settings without capability—though the broader concept (“image the biliary tree intraoperatively”) still applies.

---

## 2) KQ2 (GERD after sleeve gastrectomy: medical vs surgical therapy)
**Recommendation scope:** patients who have **GERD after sleeve gastrectomy** (post‑SG GERD).

### Patients who cannot use / are out of scope
1. **GERD not occurring after sleeve gastrectomy**
   - Primary GERD in patients without SG
   - GERD after other bariatric operations (e.g., RYGB, DS) — not the question studied

2. **Patients for whom the “BMI-based pathway” doesn’t apply**
   - The guideline’s surgical decision discussion is stratified by **BMI thresholds** (>35, 30–35, <30).  
   - If BMI is not in these ranges (or if BMI is not an appropriate decision anchor due to unusual clinical circumstances), the recommendation framework may not fit well.

3. **Patients who are not candidates for revisional bariatric surgery (especially RYGB)**
   The guideline explicitly says: **“The standard contraindications to gastric bypass still apply,”** including **psychosocial issues that may place the patient at greater risk for malnutrition or nutrient deficiencies.**
   - Practically, this excludes patients with conditions that make **RYGB unsafe or inappropriate**, such as:
     - Inability to adhere to lifelong supplementation/follow-up
     - Active, uncontrolled substance use or severe uncontrolled psychiatric disease (examples of “psychosocial issues” commonly treated as contraindications in bariatric practice)
     - High risk for or existing severe malnutrition / inability to maintain nutrition (the guideline highlights malnutrition risk particularly when BMI is low)

4. **Patients in whom a different primary problem is driving symptoms**
   - The guideline implies the need for proper evaluation (multidisciplinary reassessment, hiatal hernia assessment). If symptoms are not truly GERD or are due to another dominant pathology, applying the GERD pathway is out of scope.

---

## 3) KQ3 (Choice of bariatric procedure in patients with IBD)
**Recommendation scope:** **obese** patients with **inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)** undergoing metabolic/bariatric surgery; compares **sleeve gastrectomy vs RYGB**.

### Patients who cannot use / are out of scope
1. **No IBD**
   - This recommendation is specifically about **Crohn’s disease/ulcerative colitis** populations.

2. **Not obese / not candidates for bariatric surgery**
   - The question is framed around **obese patients** considering bariatric surgery. Non-obese patients are out of scope.

3. **Patients where the guideline itself says the evidence is insufficient to distinguish key subgroups**
   The guideline states the evidence base was too limited to draw distinctions between:
   - **Ulcerative colitis vs Crohn’s disease**
   - **Active vs quiescent disease**
   
   So, while the recommendation is offered, applying it as a firm rule in these subgroups is not supported; these patients effectively fall into a “use with extreme caution / individualized decision” category.

4. **Patients needing colorectal-surgery–dependent future options**
   - The guideline notes that UC patients who may later undergo **proctocolectomy** and be considered for **ileal pouch–anal anastomosis (IPAA)** create special complexity with RYGB.  
   - In such patients, the “default” recommendation may not be directly usable without colorectal input.

5. **Patients whose clinical features push strongly toward bypass despite IBD**
   The guideline explicitly lists factors that may modify the recommendation toward considering RYGB:
   - **Very high BMI**
   - **Concomitant GERD**
   - **Quiescent IBD**
   These are not “exclusions,” but they are situations where the sleeve-preference recommendation may not apply cleanly.

---

## Cross-cutting “cannot use as written” groups (apply to all 3 KQs)
1. **Patients outside the three addressed comorbidity scenarios**
   - If the patient’s issue is not one of:  
     (a) cholecystectomy in bypass-type anatomy,  
     (b) GERD after sleeve, or  
     (c) bariatric procedure choice in IBD,  
     then these guidelines simply don’t apply.

2. **Patients requiring decisions about procedures not evaluated**
   - For example, endoscopic bariatric therapies, one-anastomosis gastric bypass, SADI-S, etc. are not the focus of the comparative recommendations here (even if mentioned tangentially).

3. **Settings where required expertise/technology is unavailable**
   - KQ1 explicitly acknowledges feasibility limits (IOC vs alternative imaging; ability to intervene on stones found).

---

If you tell me **which key question (KQ1, KQ2, or KQ3)** you’re applying and the patient’s **operation history + BMI + main comorbidity**, I can translate the above into a short “in-scope vs out-of-scope” checklist for that exact scenario.",periop,exclusion_criteria_extraction
PMC12146249.txt,"## TARGET POPULATION (extracted from the provided guideline text)

This guideline does **not** present a single, explicit “Target Population” section in the way your melanoma/breast/prostate examples do. However, the **scope and intended populations** are clearly stated and can be extracted from the *Introduction* and from the populations embedded in the BQs/CQs. Below is the target-population text **as supported by the guideline wording**, segmented by the main clinical contexts the guideline addresses.

---

## 1) Overall guideline target population (urology perioperative infection prevention)

**Target population (inferred from scope statements):**
- Patients undergoing **urological surgery and invasive urological procedures/examinations** where **perioperative infection prevention** is relevant.
- The guideline covers perioperative infections occurring **“within 1 month of an invasive procedure such as surgery or examinations.”**
- It addresses infection prevention measures around urologic operations/procedures including (examples explicitly listed in the guideline):  
  - **Robot-assisted laparoscopic procedures**: radical prostatectomy, partial nephrectomy, pyeloplasty, radical cystectomy, etc.  
  - **Open and laparoscopic/robot-assisted surgery** (clean, clean-contaminated, contaminated, infected/dirty contexts)  
  - **Endoscopic/transurethral procedures** (TURBT, transurethral enucleation of the prostate such as HoLEP/TUEB, TUL)
- Special scope note: **“Regarding the biopsy, this guideline focuses on prostate biopsy.”** (mentioned as a focus note, though detailed biopsy recommendations are not included in the excerpt you provided)

**Key inclusion characteristics (as written):**
- Urologic procedures that often **enter/manipulate the urinary tract** or involve **direct insertion of an endoscope into the urinary tract**.
- Prevention and classification of perioperative infections including:
  - **SSI (surgical site infection)**
  - **RI (remote infection)**
  - **Postoperative UTI/GTI** (urinary tract infection / genital tract infection), which the guideline says is often hard to classify as SSI vs RI and should be treated/reported independently as UTI/GTI.

**Important scope boundary (explicit):**
- If surgery must be performed in the setting of an active UTI such that the procedure is considered **“dirty-infected surgery,”** then **antimicrobial use is not covered by the prophylaxis recommendations** in the same way:  
  - “When surgery has to be performed with complications of UTI, the use of antimicrobial agents should not be covered by the recommendation in this guideline because such urologic procedures are treated as dirty-infected surgery.”

---

## 2) Target population: patients with (or evaluated for) preoperative UTI / bacteriuria before urologic surgery (CQ1)

**Target population text (extracted/closely paraphrased from CQ1 explanation):**
- Patients scheduled for **urologic surgery** in whom **preoperative urine culture is positive** and/or **UTI is present**.
- This is particularly relevant because urologic surgery often involves **entering the urogenital tract** or **endoscopic insertion into the urinary tract**, and **preoperative UTI/bacteriuria may increase postoperative SSI and postoperative UTI**.

**Key details included in the guideline:**
- If UTI is present: use antimicrobials **sensitive to the causative organisms** preoperatively; consider postponing surgery if possible until infection treatment is completed.
- If UTI treatment is incomplete by surgery time: continue targeted antimicrobials intra- and post-operatively.
- Notes uncertainty for **asymptomatic bacteriuria** duration of therapy (lack of high-quality evidence).

---

## 3) Target population: patients undergoing open vs minimally invasive urologic surgery (BQ3 + CQs 3–6)

This section targets patients undergoing urologic operations categorized by **wound class / contamination level** and **surgical approach**.

### 3A) Clean surgery (CQ3)
**Target population (as described):**
- Patients undergoing **clean urologic surgery**, including examples explicitly listed:
  - **Adrenalectomy**
  - **Nephrectomy**
  - **Partial nephrectomy**
  - **Surgery in the inguinal or scrotum without open urinary tract**
- The guideline also notes that some procedures historically considered clean-contaminated may be treated like clean **“in the absence of UTI”** because SSI incidence is equivalent:
  - **Partial nephrectomy, nephroureterectomy, partial cystectomy** (when urinary tract is opened but no UTI)

### 3B) Clean-contaminated surgery (CQ4)
**Target population:**
- Patients undergoing **clean-contaminated urologic surgery**, especially **where the urinary tract is opened**.
- Emphasis on assessing for **preoperative UTI** and tailoring therapy to urine culture/susceptibility.

### 3C) Contaminated surgery involving the gastrointestinal tract (CQ5)
**Target population:**
- Patients undergoing **contaminated surgery** in urology, specifically **“surgery involving the gastrointestinal tract.”**
- The guideline highlights higher SSI incidence in this category compared with other urologic surgeries.

### 3D) Surgery on infected wounds / dirty-infected operations (CQ6)
**Target population (explicit examples given):**
- Patients undergoing urologic operations classified as **infected operations (class IV)**, including:
  - **Nephrectomy for pyelonephritis (including emphysematous pyelonephritis)**
  - **Drainage of retroperitoneal abscess / Fournier’s gangrene (necrotizing fasciitis)**

**Notable patient characteristic mentioned:**
- Emphysematous pyelonephritis is noted as prevalent in **patients with diabetes**, and the guideline mentions increasing antimicrobial resistance as a consideration.

---

## 4) Target population: procedure-specific endoscopic/transurethral populations (CQs 7–9)

### 4A) TURBT patients (CQ7)
**Target population:**
- Patients undergoing **transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT)**.

**Important exclusions used in cited RCT (population detail included in the guideline text):**
- Patients with **preoperative bacteriuria (>10^4/mL)** were excluded.
- Patients with **preoperative catheter placement** were excluded (examples listed: urinary catheter, double J stent, nephrostomy catheter).

**Risk stratification details mentioned:**
- “Low-risk cases” where no prophylaxis may be considered (the guideline associates risk with factors such as tumor size/operative time; it also lists reported risk factors for postoperative infection such as older age, larger tumor size, preop hospitalization duration, pyuria/bacteriuria, etc.).

### 4B) Transurethral enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP, TUEB) (CQ8)
**Target population:**
- Patients undergoing **transurethral enucleation of the prostate**, including:
  - **HoLEP (Holmium Laser Enucleation of the Prostate)**
  - **TUEB (Transurethral Enucleation with Bipolar)**

**Additional population detail mentioned:**
- Postoperative fever risk factor noted: **positive urine culture in patients with indwelling urinary catheters**.

### 4C) TUL patients (CQ9)
**Target population:**
- Patients undergoing **TUL (transurethral ureterolithotripsy)**.

**Subgrouping detail explicitly discussed:**
- Patients with **negative preoperative urine culture** and **stone burden ≤200 mm²** vs **>200 mm²** (the guideline cites evidence suggesting prophylaxis may be less necessary in smaller stone burden with negative culture, but still supports single-dose prophylaxis overall).
- Cases where **infected stones are expected**: prophylaxis should be based on urine culture susceptibilities and preoperative administration considered.

---

## 5) Target population: patients considered for postoperative drain placement (CQ2)

**Target population:**
- Patients undergoing specific urologic surgeries where the guideline evaluates whether drains prevent SSI, including:
  - **Robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP)** (including patients with or without lymph node dissection in cited RCTs)
  - **Robot-assisted partial nephrectomy (RAPN)**
  - **Nephrectomy / nephroureterectomy**
  - **Radical cystectomy** (evidence described as poor/inconclusive; decision individualized based on complication risk)

---

### If you want, I can reformat the above into a single “TARGET POPULATION” block in the style of your examples (one overall block + separate blocks for TURBT/HoLEP-TUEB/TUL and for infected-wound surgery).",periop,target_population_extraction
PMC12146249.txt,"These JUA 2023 “perioperative infection prevention in urology” recommendations are **prophylaxis guidelines** (how to prevent infection around surgery). They are **not meant to be applied**—or must be applied only with major modification—when the patient’s situation falls outside “standard elective prophylaxis.” From the text you provided, the main **exclusion / non-applicable populations and situations** are:

## 1) Patients undergoing surgery in the setting of an *active infection* (i.e., “dirty/infected” surgery)
The guideline’s prophylactic regimens (single dose, ≤24 h, etc.) are intended for **clean / clean-contaminated / contaminated** operations *without an established active infection at the time of surgery*.

- If the patient has a **UTI that is not treated/controlled by the time of surgery**, the document explicitly states that:
  - the procedure should be treated as **dirty-infected surgery**, and  
  - **“the use of antimicrobial agents should not be covered by the recommendation in this guideline”** (i.e., prophylaxis tables/durations don’t apply).
- Examples of clearly “infected wound”/Class IV situations discussed:
  - **Nephrectomy for pyelonephritis** (including emphysematous pyelonephritis)
  - **Drainage/debridement for Fournier’s gangrene** (necrotizing fasciitis)
  - Retroperitoneal abscess drainage

**Practical meaning:** these patients need **therapeutic, often broad-spectrum empiric antibiotics with culture-guided de-escalation**, not routine prophylaxis.

## 2) Patients with positive preoperative urine culture / bacteriuria *who are not treated before surgery*
The guideline supports treating bacteriuria/UTI preoperatively and postponing surgery if possible. But if surgery proceeds **before infection treatment is completed**, then:
- antibiotic use becomes **treatment**, not prophylaxis, and
- the “standard prophylaxis” recommendations (drug choice/duration) **do not apply**.

(If bacteriuria/UTI is appropriately treated and controlled pre-op, then the patient can generally return to the usual prophylaxis pathway.)

## 3) Patients/procedures outside the guideline’s scope (content limitations)
From your excerpt, there is at least one explicit scope limitation:

- **Biopsy section focuses on prostate biopsy**  
  → So recommendations should not be assumed to cover other biopsy types (e.g., renal mass biopsy, bladder biopsy approaches) unless the full guideline includes them elsewhere.

Also, the guideline is framed around the listed urologic surgeries and endoscopic procedures (e.g., TURBT, HoLEP/TUEB, TUL, nephrectomy, cystectomy, prostatectomy). If a patient is undergoing a **procedure not addressed**, the guideline cannot be used as-is.

## 4) “Low-risk TURBT with omission of prophylaxis” does **not** include certain patients
The guideline notes that **no prophylaxis may be considered only in low-risk TURBT**, and the RCT it cites **excluded** patients with:
- **Preoperative bacteriuria** (e.g., >10⁴/mL in that trial), and/or
- **Preoperative urinary tract devices** such as:
  - indwelling urethral catheter
  - ureteral stent (double-J)
  - nephrostomy catheter

**Practical meaning:** patients with bacteriuria or urinary drainage devices should **not** be managed with the “omit prophylaxis” approach.

## 5) Patients who cannot receive the recommended antibiotic classes (drug-eligibility exclusions)
Even when the guideline applies procedurally, it may be unusable for an individual patient if they cannot safely receive the recommended agents, for example:
- **Severe beta-lactam allergy** (cephalosporins/penicillins with BLI are first-line in many sections)
- Other contraindications driven by comorbidity or drug interactions (e.g., aminoglycoside avoidance in certain renal-risk contexts)

The guideline excerpt doesn’t list full alternative regimens for every contraindication, so in such patients the guideline may not be directly usable without local infectious disease/pharmacy protocols.

---

### If you want, I can tailor this to your use case
Tell me the **procedure** (e.g., RARP, TURBT, TUL, cystectomy), whether there is **bacteriuria/UTI**, and whether there is a **catheter/stent/nephrostomy**, and I’ll state clearly whether the guideline applies and which branch (clean/clean-contaminated/contaminated/dirty-infected) the patient falls into.",periop,exclusion_criteria_extraction
PMC3872300.txt,"## TARGET POPULATION (extracted from the provided guideline text)

### 1) Primary target population (overall guideline scope)
**Patients with ventral and incisional abdominal wall hernias who are being considered for, or undergoing, laparoscopic ventral/incisional hernia repair (LVHR)** (including IPOM-based approaches).

**Key details explicitly described in the text:**
- The guideline repeatedly frames its recommendations around **“the patient who presents with a ventral/incisional hernia”** and discusses outcomes/technique variability for **ventral/incisional hernia repair**, particularly **laparoscopic** repair.
- Hernia types repeatedly included under this umbrella in the text include:
  - **Incisional hernia**
  - **Ventral hernia**
  - **Umbilical / paraumbilical hernia**
  - **Epigastric hernia**
  - Location-based variants that affect approach/outcomes: **suprapubic**, **subxiphoidal**, **flank**, **subcostal**, **parastomal**, and other “atypical locations.”
- The guideline emphasizes that this population is **heterogeneous**, with outcomes influenced by:
  - Patient factors: **age**, **BMI/obesity**, **COPD**, smoking history, comorbidities, etc.
  - Hernia factors: **defect size**, **location**, **incarceration**, **loss-of-domain**, reducibility.
  - Treatment factors: **mesh type**, **mesh position**, **fixation method**, surgeon skill/experience, facility/environment.

---

## Sub-populations explicitly called out (with specific “who this applies to” details)

### 2) Patients for whom CT (and sometimes MRI) is particularly relevant preoperatively
The guideline states CT is **not** recommended for *all* ventral hernias, but is recommended for **specific patient groups/cases**, namely:
- **Obese patients** (when clinical exam may fail to detect hernia)
- Patients with **repeated previous operations**
- Patients with **large hernias with possible loss of domain**
- **Traumatic ventral hernias** / abdominal trauma cases
- Patients with **uncommon abdominal wall hernias** (diagnostic clarification)

**Postoperative imaging target group (CT):**
- Patients after LVHR where there is need to differentiate **recurrence vs seroma vs bulging/residual hernia**; CT described as the **method of choice** for postoperative differential diagnosis.

---

### 3) Patients with obesity and ventral/incisional hernia (higher-risk subgroup)
The guideline specifically discusses **obese persons** as a distinct subgroup:
- **Obesity is a risk factor** for developing incisional hernia and for **higher perioperative complications and recurrence** after open repair.
- The text highlights that obese patients often have **larger defects** and **higher recurrence**, especially when:
  - **BMI > 30 kg/m²**, and/or
  - Defect size is **> 8–10 cm** (recurrence risk noted as increasing with larger defects; one cited series reports markedly higher recurrence beyond 10–12 cm and >12 cm).
- The guideline notes laparoscopic IPOM is associated with **lower wound infection rates** than open repair, which is particularly relevant in obese patients due to higher wound-complication risk.

---

### 4) Patients with small abdominal wall hernias (often umbilical/epigastric) where suture vs mesh is debated
The guideline identifies a commonly used (consensus) definition and clinical decision context:
- “Small hernia” is often taken to mean a defect **≤ 2 cm** (noted as consensus, though not universally defined).
- This subgroup is discussed in the context of whether **open suture repair** still has a role versus **mesh repair**, with many studies favoring mesh due to recurrence concerns.

---

### 5) Patients with large/giant hernias or large defect size (technique-limitation subgroup)
The guideline notes that “large hernia” is **poorly defined** across studies, with thresholds used such as:
- **>5 cm**, **>10 cm**, **>15 cm**, and “giant” sometimes **>20 cm** (varies by study).
This subgroup is discussed because defect size affects:
- Feasibility/limitations of laparoscopic IPOM
- Need for **greater mesh overlap**
- Recurrence risk and operative complexity

---

### 6) Patients with recurrent ventral/incisional hernia after prior repair (redo subgroup)
The guideline explicitly addresses:
- **Reoperations for recurrence** (challenging; limited evidence)
- Patients with recurrence after:
  - **Previous open suture repair** (approach decision similar to primary incisional hernia)
  - **Previous open mesh repair** (laparoscopic reoperation may have advantages, including operating in a different tissue plane and covering the entire scar)

---

### 7) Patients with suprapubic hernia (location-defined subgroup)
The guideline defines suprapubic hernia using published definitions/EHS classification:
- Defect located **~3–4 cm above the symphysis pubis** (per Carbonell/Palanivelu definitions cited)
- EHS classification: **M5**
- Often **postoperative incisional** (example given: after **suprapubic radical prostatectomy**)

This subgroup is discussed because it often requires:
- Specific dissection (retropubic/Retzius space in many techniques)
- Specific fixation considerations and overlap requirements

---

### 8) Patients with subxiphoid hernia (location-defined subgroup)
The guideline defines subxiphoid hernia as:
- EHS classification: **M1**
- Reported incidence after **median sternotomy**: **~1–4.2%** (as cited)

This subgroup is discussed due to:
- Need for careful dissection of the **retroxiphoidal space** and attention to anatomic landmarks (diaphragm/pericardium/sternum relationships)
- Fixation/overlap challenges near the xiphoid/sternum

---

### 9) Patients at higher risk of surgical site infection (SSI) where antibiotic prophylaxis is considered
The guideline does not define a separate disease target group here, but it **explicitly lists patient risk-factor subgroups** for whom prophylactic antibiotics are “advisable to consider,” including:
- **Advanced age**
- **Corticosteroid use**
- **Immunosuppressive therapy**
- **Obesity**
- **Diabetes**
- **Malignant tumor**
And surgical risk contexts:
- **Contamination**
- **Long operation duration**
- **Drainage**
- **Urinary catheter**

---

## Notes on what is *not* explicitly specified in the provided text
- The excerpt does **not** provide a single, formal “TARGET POPULATION” heading statement (like your melanoma/prostate examples). Instead, the target population must be inferred from repeated scope language focusing on **patients with ventral/incisional hernias undergoing laparoscopic repair** and the explicitly described subgroups above.
- Pediatric patients are mentioned only in passing (e.g., pediatric umbilical hernia incarceration data), but the excerpt does not clearly state that the guideline’s recommendations are pediatric-focused.

If you upload the PDF or images of the guideline pages (or tell me the exact section where “Scope/Target population” appears), I can extract the *verbatim* target-population paragraph(s) exactly as written.",periop,target_population_extraction
PMC3872300.txt,"The IEHS document you quoted is a **technical guideline for laparoscopic ventral/incisional hernia repair (primarily laparoscopic IPOM and variants)**. It is **not** written as a “who should/shouldn’t have surgery at all” guideline, and it does **not** provide one single, explicit “exclusion criteria” list the way a clinical trial would.

That said, in practice there are clear groups of patients for whom **this laparoscopic guideline is not applicable or should not be followed as written**, because they are **outside the intended scope** or have **contraindications to laparoscopy/IPOM**. These exclusions fall into two categories:

1) **Out of scope of the guideline (population/procedure mismatch)**  
2) **Not suitable for laparoscopic repair at that time (clinical contraindications/relative contraindications)**

Below is a detailed, practical “exclusion criteria” style summary based on what the guideline covers and the standard constraints repeatedly implied in the text (e.g., need for safe adhesiolysis, ability to obtain overlap/fixation, contamination concerns, etc.).

---

## 1) Patients outside the intended scope of this guideline

### A. Groin hernias and non–abdominal-wall hernias
- Inguinal/femoral hernias are not the target (they are only mentioned for comparison of evidence).
- Diaphragmatic/hiatal hernias are not included.

### B. Pediatric patients (generally)
- The guideline is written for **adult ventral/incisional hernia repair**. Pediatric umbilical hernia is mentioned epidemiologically, but pediatric operative decision-making/technique is not the focus.

### C. Patients needing a different reconstructive operation than laparoscopic IPOM-type repair
If the patient’s problem requires **formal abdominal wall reconstruction** rather than intraperitoneal bridging/augmentation, the IPOM-focused recommendations may not apply, for example:
- Large “loss of domain” hernias where **component separation, progressive pneumoperitoneum, botulinum toxin, or staged reconstruction** is required.
- Situations where **primary fascial closure is mandatory** but cannot be achieved laparoscopically without unacceptable tension (the guideline discusses IPOM-plus/closure concepts, but very complex reconstructions may exceed its scope).

---

## 2) Patients who generally should NOT undergo laparoscopic ventral/incisional hernia repair (or not follow this guideline as written)

These are the practical “cannot use this guideline” groups because the core assumptions of laparoscopic IPOM (safe access, safe adhesiolysis, clean field, ability to overlap/fix mesh) are violated.

### A. Patients with an **active infection or contaminated surgical field**
Laparoscopic IPOM with permanent synthetic mesh is typically **avoided** when there is:
- Active abdominal wall infection, abscess, infected prior mesh
- Enterocutaneous fistula
- Bowel perforation/spillage, peritonitis
- Need for concomitant bowel resection in a contaminated setting (case-dependent)

Why this excludes the guideline: much of the technique guidance assumes **elective, clean or clean-contaminated** conditions and intraperitoneal mesh placement; contamination changes mesh choice, approach, and strategy.

### B. Patients who cannot safely tolerate laparoscopy/pneumoperitoneum (general anesthesia constraints)
Examples:
- Severe cardiopulmonary disease where pneumoperitoneum/Trendelenburg or reverse Trendelenburg is unsafe
- Uncorrected coagulopathy (bleeding risk with trocar placement, adhesiolysis, transfascial sutures)
- Hemodynamic instability (especially in emergency presentations)

Why this excludes the guideline: the technique sections assume the patient can undergo **standard laparoscopic insufflation pressures** and positioning.

### C. Patients with **acute strangulation/ischemic bowel** requiring urgent open exploration (often)
While some incarcerated hernias can be approached laparoscopically by experts, patients with:
- Peritonitis
- Suspected necrotic bowel
- Unstable obstruction
often require an **open operation** and individualized decisions.

Why this excludes the guideline: the guideline discusses acute presentations as higher morbidity; the standard laparoscopic IPOM pathway may not be appropriate when bowel viability is in question.

### D. Patients in whom **safe adhesiolysis is not feasible or risk is unacceptably high**
The guideline emphasizes adhesiolysis as a major risk driver (enterotomy risk increases with extent of adhesiolysis). Patients may be poor candidates when there is:
- Dense, extensive adhesions from multiple prior laparotomies
- Prior radiation, severe inflammatory conditions
- History suggesting “frozen abdomen”
- Prior complications from adhesiolysis/enterotomy

Why this excludes the guideline: laparoscopic IPOM depends on being able to clear enough abdominal wall for overlap; if you cannot do that safely, the approach (and thus the guideline) doesn’t fit.

### E. Hernias where **adequate mesh overlap/fixation cannot be achieved laparoscopically**
The guideline repeatedly stresses that success requires **wide overlap (commonly 3–5 cm or more, increasing with defect size)** and secure fixation. Patients may be excluded when anatomy prevents this, e.g.:
- Certain extreme subxiphoid/suprapubic/flank defects where overlap is limited by bony structures and safe fixation is not achievable with the planned method
- Very large defects where the required mesh size/positioning cannot be accomplished laparoscopically in that patient

(These locations are discussed as “more complex” with different outcomes; in some patients they become practical contraindications.)

### F. Patients with **giant defects / severe loss of domain** where IPOM bridging is predictably inadequate
The guideline notes markedly different outcomes for small defects vs loss-of-domain hernias and discusses that “large hernia” is variably defined; it also cites data showing sharply rising recurrence with larger defects (e.g., >10–12 cm in some series, especially with obesity).

Practical exclusion: if the patient’s hernia requires **restoration of abdominal wall domain and function** beyond what laparoscopic IPOM (even IPOM-plus) can deliver, then this guideline is not the right playbook.

### G. Pregnancy (practical exclusion)
Not directly addressed in your excerpt, but in real-world application:
- Elective ventral/incisional hernia repair is usually deferred in pregnancy unless emergent.
- Pneumoperitoneum and mesh decisions are different.

So pregnant patients are generally **outside the intended elective laparoscopic guideline pathway**.

---

## Important nuance: “High-risk” is not the same as “excluded”
The guideline explicitly discusses groups with worse outcomes or higher complexity but does **not** automatically exclude them, for example:
- **Obesity** (often *favors* laparoscopy due to fewer wound infections, though recurrence risk rises with very large defects)
- **Older age** (not a contraindication per cited data)
- **Recurrent hernias after open repair** (laparoscopy may be advantageous in selected cases)

So these are **not exclusion criteria** by themselves; they are “use with caution / modify technique / ensure expertise” groups.

---

## If you tell me the patient scenario, I can map it to “excluded vs caution”
If you share (even roughly): hernia type/location, defect size, symptoms (elective vs emergency), prior surgeries/mesh, BMI, infection/contamination status, and major cardiopulmonary issues—I can state whether they are effectively **excluded from this laparoscopic guideline** or just **higher-risk but still within scope**, and what alternative pathway is usually considered.",periop,exclusion_criteria_extraction
PMC8250763.txt,"## TARGET POPULATION (extracted from the guideline text you provided)

### Overall population in scope
**Patients who have previously been infected with SARS‑CoV‑2 and who require surgery**, with the guideline focused on **timing of (planned/elective) surgery after SARS‑CoV‑2 infection**.

Key scope signals from the text:
- “a significant number of patients who have previously been infected with SARS‑CoV‑2 will require surgery”
- “timing of surgery after SARS‑CoV‑2 infection must account for…”
- “Elective surgery should not be scheduled within 7 weeks of a diagnosis of SARS‑CoV‑2 infection…”

---

## Segmented target populations (with significant details)

### 1) Patients being considered for **elective (planned) surgery** after SARS‑CoV‑2 infection
**Who they are**
- Patients with a **documented diagnosis of SARS‑CoV‑2 infection** who are now being scheduled for **elective surgery**.

**Important defining details**
- Timing decisions should incorporate:
  - **Severity of the initial infection**
  - **Ongoing symptoms of COVID‑19**
  - **Comorbid and functional status** (before and after infection)
  - **Clinical priority and risk of disease progression**
  - **Complexity of surgery**
- A core recommendation applies broadly: **do not schedule elective surgery within 7 weeks of diagnosis**, unless deferring surgery poses greater risk (e.g., disease progression/urgency).

---

### 2) Patients who may still be **infectious** at the time surgery is being considered (peri‑infectious period)
**Who they are**
- Post‑diagnosis patients still within the period where they “may be infectious,” stratified by severity.

**Important defining details**
- Planned surgery should not be considered during the infectious window:
  - **10 days after mild/moderate disease**
  - **15–20 days after severe disease**
- If surgery is unavoidable during this period (i.e., emergency), the guideline specifies **full transmission‑based precautions**.

---

### 3) Patients with **transient or asymptomatic** SARS‑CoV‑2 infection (recovered, no persistent symptoms)
**Who they are**
- Patients whose infection was **asymptomatic** or **transient** and who have **fully recovered** (no ongoing symptoms at time of surgery planning).

**Important defining details**
- The guideline states most such patients:
  - “require **no additional precautions beyond a 7‑week delay**”
- They still fall under the general principle:
  - **avoid elective surgery <7 weeks** from diagnosis unless deferral risk outweighs surgical risk.

---

### 4) Patients with **persistent symptoms (“long COVID”/ongoing symptoms)** after SARS‑CoV‑2 infection
**Who they are**
- Patients who continue to have **ongoing symptoms of COVID‑19** at the time surgery is being planned.

**Important defining details**
- They are explicitly identified as **higher risk**:
  - “increased risk of postoperative morbidity and mortality even after 7 weeks”
- The guideline indicates:
  - **consider delaying beyond 7 weeks**, balancing against disease progression/priority
  - need for **specialist assessment** and **personalised multidisciplinary peri‑operative management**

---

### 5) Patients who were **hospitalised** for COVID‑19 (more severe initial disease)
**Who they are**
- Patients who required **hospital admission** for COVID‑19.

**Important defining details**
- They “require special attention” (even if beyond 7 weeks).
- Often overlap with:
  - persistent symptoms
  - deconditioning and need for rehabilitation/prehabilitation

---

### 6) Patients who required **critical care** for COVID‑19 (ICU-level severity)
**Who they are**
- Patients recovering from **critical care admission** due to COVID‑19.

**Important defining details**
- Require “special consideration” due to:
  - residual pathophysiological sequelae
  - **deconditioning** and need for **physical rehabilitation**
  - potential exposure to treatments affecting immune status (see next segment)

---

### 7) **Severely immunosuppressed** patients (including some treated for severe COVID‑19)
**Who they are**
- Patients considered “severely immunosuppressed” (referenced as defined in an appendix), and the text notes this **may include** some patients treated for severe COVID‑19 with:
  - **dexamethasone**
  - **anti‑inflammatory monoclonal antibodies** (examples given: **tocilizumab**, **sarilumab**)

**Important defining details**
- For these patients:
  - “**specialist advice should be sought**”
  - multidisciplinary discussion is recommended before planning surgery

---

### 8) **Higher-risk for severe COVID‑19 outcomes** (re: preventing peri‑operative infection)
**Who they are**
- Patients at higher risk of severe disease/mortality from COVID‑19, explicitly listed as:
  - **older people**
  - **men**
  - **Black, Asian and minority ethnic groups**
  - **patients with comorbidities**

**Important defining details**
- This segment is discussed in the context of **minimising peri‑operative SARS‑CoV‑2 infection** (patients arriving incubating infection or acquiring it in hospital), with emphasis on prevention measures (vaccination, isolation, screening, dedicated pathways).

---

### 9) **Children** with SARS‑CoV‑2 infection (mentioned as a distinct group)
**Who they are**
- Paediatric patients with SARS‑CoV‑2 infection who require surgery.

**Important defining details**
- The guideline notes (without making a full separate recommendation set) that:
  - “Some data suggest that peri‑operative outcomes of **children**… are favourable compared with adults”
- This is a population mention rather than a fully developed target subgroup with specific timing rules in the provided text.

If you upload the actual PDF/image of the guideline (or share the title/section that contains a formal “Target population” heading), I can extract the exact wording verbatim and format it exactly like your examples (including explicit “in scope / out of scope” statements if present).",periop,target_population_extraction
PMC8250763.txt,"This consensus statement is written for **planning elective (non-urgent) surgery after a patient has had SARS‑CoV‑2 infection**. Patients fall *outside* (or cannot straightforwardly “use”) the guideline in the situations below—either because the document explicitly says the recommendations don’t apply as written, or because it requires specialist/individualised decision-making rather than following the standard timing rules.

## 1) Patients who still may be infectious (elective surgery should not be planned)
The guideline excludes proceeding with *planned* surgery during the period a patient may still be infectious:
- **Within 10 days** after **mild/moderate** COVID-19.
- **Within 15–20 days** after **severe** COVID-19.

If surgery is unavoidable in this window, it is treated as **emergency surgery** and requires **full transmission-based precautions**—so the elective-surgery timing pathway is not applicable.

## 2) Emergency/urgent surgery patients (not an “elective timing” decision)
If the operation is **emergency** (or so urgent that delay is unsafe), the “delay surgery for X weeks” framework is not what guides care. The statement notes that when emergency surgery is required during the infectious period, enhanced precautions are needed; more broadly, emergency cases require a different risk–benefit approach than elective scheduling.

## 3) Severely immunosuppressed patients (standard timelines may not apply)
The document flags **severely immunosuppressed** patients as needing **specialist advice** rather than simply applying the standard “wait 7 weeks” approach. It specifically notes this *may include* patients who, during severe COVID-19 treatment, received:
- **Dexamethasone**, and/or
- **Anti-inflammatory monoclonal antibodies** (e.g., **tocilizumab**, **sarilumab**)

Because immunosuppression can affect infectiousness duration, recovery, and peri-operative risk, these patients are not “excluded” from surgery, but they **cannot use the guideline as a simple rule**; they require **individualised specialist input** (e.g., immunology/infectious diseases and peri-operative MDT).

## 4) Patients with persistent/ongoing COVID-19 symptoms (“long COVID”) (not a simple 7‑week rule)
The guideline’s “most patients just need a 7‑week delay” does **not** apply cleanly to:
- Patients with **persistent symptoms** (ongoing COVID-19 symptoms at the time surgery is being considered)

For these patients, the statement says:
- They remain at **increased postoperative morbidity and mortality even after 7 weeks**, and
- **Delaying beyond 7 weeks should be considered**, with **specialist assessment and personalised multidisciplinary peri-operative management**.

So they cannot rely on the standard timing recommendation alone.

## 5) Patients who were hospitalised/critical care survivors (require special attention, not a simple rule)
The document separates out patients who:
- Were **hospitalised** with COVID-19, especially those needing **critical care**.

These patients may have residual multi-system effects and significant deconditioning, and often need:
- **Rehabilitation/prehabilitation**
- **Functional assessment**
- **MDT optimisation**
- Sometimes **specialist discussion** (particularly if they received immunomodulating treatments)

Again, not excluded from surgery, but **excluded from “one-size-fits-all” timing**.

## 6) Children (evidence base differs; recommendations may not generalise)
The statement notes that some data suggest peri-operative outcomes in **children** with SARS‑CoV‑2 infection may be more favourable than in adults. Practically, this means the adult-derived timing/risk estimates may not directly apply; paediatric pathways may differ.

---

### Practical takeaway
Patients who **cannot simply apply** this guideline as a straightforward “wait X days/weeks then proceed” are mainly:
1) those **still potentially infectious**,  
2) **emergency/urgent** surgical cases,  
3) the **severely immunosuppressed**,  
4) those with **persistent symptoms**, and  
5) those **hospitalised/critical care** survivors (complex recovery),  
with **children** being a group where applicability is less certain.

If you tell me the patient category (asymptomatic vs persistent symptoms; hospitalised/ICU; immunosuppressed; urgency of surgery), I can map it to what the guideline recommends for that scenario.",periop,exclusion_criteria_extraction
PMC12750329.txt,"## TARGET POPULATION (extracted from the guideline text)

This consensus guideline applies to **patients undergoing liver resection (hepatectomy / liver surgery)** and focuses on **peri- and postoperative management**.

### Core population (who the guideline is for)
- **All patients undergoing liver surgery / liver resection**, where “liver resection is a fundamental intervention for the treatment of:
  - **primary hepatic malignancies**
  - **secondary hepatic malignancies**
  - **selected benign liver disorders**”
- The recommendations are intended to guide clinicians on **perioperative matters and management of postoperative complications** after liver resection, across six domains:
  1) thromboprophylaxis  
  2) perioperative antibiotics  
  3) prehabilitation/nutrition/mobilization  
  4) bile leak (including bilioenteric anastomosis leaks)  
  5) post-hepatectomy haemorrhage  
  6) post-hepatectomy liver failure (PHLF)

### Subgroups explicitly mentioned (target populations within the overall population)
The guideline repeatedly specifies certain **higher-risk or special liver-resection subpopulations**. Below are the main “target population segments” that are explicitly described.

---

## 1) Patients undergoing liver surgery (general; “all patients” statements)
**Population text (as stated):**
- “**Pharmacological thromboprophylaxis is recommended for all patients undergoing liver surgery**… Mechanical thromboprophylaxis… should be considered routinely.”
- “For liver surgery prophylaxis…” (antibiotic prophylaxis recommendations are framed for liver surgery broadly)
- “Early mobilization after liver surgery…” (mobilization recommendations apply broadly after hepatectomy)

**Significant details:**
- Applies across liver resections regardless of indication, but many statements acknowledge evidence gaps and variability by:
  - extent of resection (minor vs major/extended)
  - open vs minimally invasive approach
  - underlying liver function and comorbidity burden

---

## 2) Patients undergoing hepatectomy for malignancy (oncologic liver resection)
**Population text (as stated):**
- Prehabilitation: “patients prior to hepatectomy for **both benign and malignant liver disease**…”
- Body composition: “screening for low skeletal muscle mass (LSMM) should be done in **every patient considered for hepatectomy for liver malignancies**.”
- Thromboprophylaxis duration: “many advocate prolonged prophylaxis of **4 weeks to all patients undergoing liver surgery for malignancy**…”

**Significant details:**
- Explicitly includes patients undergoing resection for liver malignancies such as:
  - **hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)** (discussed in evidence summaries)
  - **colorectal liver metastases (CRLM)** (discussed in evidence summaries)
  - **perihilar cholangiocarcinoma** (appears in vascular resection and biliary reconstruction contexts)
- Emphasis on:
  - **LSMM/sarcopenia screening** using CT (since CT is routinely used for staging)
  - considering **extended LMWH prophylaxis (~4 weeks)** especially in malignancy cases

---

## 3) High-risk patients for surgical-site infection (SSI) after hepatectomy
**Population text (as stated):**
- “Patients at higher risk of SSI can be characterized by bacterial colonization resistant to commonly used prophylactic antibiotics or by factors… like **underlying liver disease, preoperative biliary drainage, and synchronous resections of the gastrointestinal tract**.”
- For postoperative fever: high-risk examples include “**preoperative biliary drainages, bilioenteric anastomosis, immunosuppression, or co-morbidities like diabetes mellitus**…”

**Significant details (risk factors listed in the guideline):**
- **Preoperative patient-related**: obesity, diabetes, chronic pulmonary disease, chronic cardiac disease, anaemia, malnutrition/hypoalbuminemia, resistant bacterial colonization
- **Preoperative liver-related**: hepatolithiasis, chronic liver disease, biliary obstruction, **preoperative biliary drainage**
- **Technical/logistic**: previous liver resection, planned bilioenteric anastomosis, prior hospitalization
- **Surgical**: high IV fluid volumes, blood transfusion, prolonged operation time, concomitant bowel surgery
- **Postoperative**: persistent inflammatory markers (e.g., CRP), bile leakage

---

## 4) Patients at high risk for bile leak after hepatectomy
**Population text (as stated):**
- Imaging: “Routine use of advanced imaging… is not recommended for **asymptomatic patients at high risk**… For patients with suspected or detected bile leaks, the threshold for performing radiological imaging should be low.”
- Risk factors “widely accepted” for postoperative bile leakage are explicitly listed.

**Significant details (risk factors listed in the guideline):**
- **Preoperative risk factors**: anaemia, liver cirrhosis, mechanical jaundice, chemotherapy with anti-VEGF antibodies (bevacizumab), positive bacterial culture (bile swab), reoperations (for reasons other than bile leakage)
- **Intraoperative/surgical risk factors**: **major or complex resections** (including mesohepatectomy), vascular resections/reconstructions, re-resections, central bile duct resections
- Additional: operation time, blood loss, Pringle manoeuvre

---

## 5) Patients undergoing complex biliary reconstruction (bilioenteric anastomosis)
**Population text (as stated):**
- “Transanastomotic stents can be considered in **complex bilioenteric anastomoses** (that is **extended resections, small bile ducts, friable tissue**) but are not recommended for routine use.”

**Significant details:**
- This segment is specifically about hepatectomy cases involving **bile duct resection and reconstruction** / bilioenteric anastomosis.
- The guideline also specifies culture practices for this group:
  - “In case of bile duct resection and reconstruction, **intraoperative biliary cultures should be obtained**…”

---

## 6) Patients undergoing hepatectomy with portal vein resection and reconstruction
**Population text (as stated):**
- “What anticoagulation should be used when performing hepatectomy with **portal vein resection and reconstruction**?”

**Significant details:**
- The guideline states there is **no strong evidence** for a single prevention strategy for portal vein thrombosis (PVT) in this subgroup.
- Management should be **tailored to patient-specific factors and clinical judgement**.

---

## 7) Overweight/obese patients and patients with MASLD (bleeding risk reduction strategies)
**Population text (as stated):**
- “In patients who are **overweight or obese**, the implementation of a low-calorie, low-fat diet should be considered…”
- “Preoperative management of **metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD)** should align with… EASL–EASD–EASO…”

**Significant details:**
- This segment is tied to strategies to reduce intraoperative blood loss and transfusion.
- MASLD is highlighted as increasing bleeding risk and motivating targeted preoperative optimization.

---

## 8) Patients at high risk of PHLF (post-hepatectomy liver failure)
**Population text (as stated):**
- Monitoring markers: “parameters should be used to monitor liver function in patients at **high risk of PHLF**…”
- Early biomarkers: measurement “can be considered in **high-risk patients** after hepatic resection…”

**Significant details:**
- The guideline does not fully define “high-risk” inside this document; it repeatedly says high-risk patients should be defined “**as per recent consensus guidelines**” (i.e., external/previous consensus).
- It does specify what to monitor in this population (bilirubin, INR, albumin, lactate, etc.) and emphasizes infection and kidney monitoring.

---

## 9) Elderly or frail patients (mobilization considerations)
**Population text (as stated):**
- “Walking… should start at least on second postoperative day… carefully supervised especially in **elderly or frail patients**.”

**Significant details:**
- This is a practical implementation subgroup within postoperative mobilization guidance, emphasizing supervision and adaptation to functional capacity.

---

### What is *not* explicitly defined as a target population
- The document does **not** provide a single, boxed “Target Population” section (like your melanoma/prostate examples). Instead, the target population is conveyed throughout the introduction and topic statements as **patients undergoing liver resection**, with multiple explicitly named subgroups (high-risk SSI, high-risk bile leak, malignancy resections, portal vein reconstruction, etc.).",periop,target_population_extraction
PMC12750329.txt,"The paper is a **consensus on peri‑ and postoperative management *following liver resection***. It is not written as a “patient-facing eligibility guideline” with a single explicit exclusion list; instead, its *scope* and the *assumptions behind the evidence base* imply who it does **not** apply to (or only applies with major caution). Below are the practical exclusion/“do not use as-is” groups.

## 1) Patients who are **not undergoing liver resection**
These recommendations are intended for **hepatectomy/liver resection** patients. They are **not** designed for:
- **Liver transplantation** (different physiology, immunosuppression, vascular/biliary issues; even the PVT timing discussion borrows a transplant cut-off but notes different mechanisms).
- **Non-surgical liver cancer therapies** (ablation, TACE, systemic therapy only).
- **Pancreatic surgery without hepatectomy**, except where cited studies included mixed cohorts (but the statements are still framed for liver resection).

## 2) **Children/adolescents** (paediatric liver surgery)
The document is written from an adult hepatobiliary practice perspective and the cited thresholds/tests (for example CPET cut-offs, LMWH duration concepts, SSI risk factors) are overwhelmingly adult-derived. So it should not be applied to:
- **Paediatric hepatectomy** patients (including metabolic disease resections, hepatoblastoma resections) without paediatric-specific adaptation.

## 3) Patients in whom a recommendation is **contraindicated by “exceptional circumstances”**
Several statements explicitly assume “standard” candidacy and then carve out contraindications. The clearest is thromboprophylaxis:

### Pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis (LMWH/UFH)
The guideline recommends it for “all” liver surgery patients **unless contraindicated**. Patients who therefore *cannot follow that part of the guideline* include those with typical anticoagulation contraindications, for example:
- **Active bleeding** or uncontrolled surgical bleeding risk
- **Severe coagulopathy** where clinicians judge heparin unsafe (for example very high INR with bleeding tendency, profound thrombocytopenia—thresholds are not specified in the consensus)
- **Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)** history (LMWH/UFH not usable)
- **Immediate reoperation/ongoing haemostasis concerns** where the team defers anticoagulation

So: these patients are not excluded from the *whole* guideline, but they are excluded from *using that recommendation as written*.

## 4) Patients in **resource-limited settings** where required diagnostics/therapies are unavailable
The authors explicitly warn that many panelists work in high-volume, high-resource centres and that implementation depends on local resources. Parts of the guideline assume access to:
- **Interventional radiology** (for percutaneous drainage, vascular interventions)
- **ERCP** capability (for bile leak management)
- **Advanced imaging** (contrast MR cholangiography, SPECT-CT in some discussions)
- **Specialist perioperative services** (prehabilitation programmes, dietetics, physiotherapy, CPET)

If these are not available, the guideline is not “invalid,” but it **cannot be used as a strict protocol**; it requires local substitution pathways.

## 5) Patients undergoing scenarios the evidence base often **does not cover well** (apply only with caution)
The paper repeatedly notes weak/heterogeneous evidence in “complex surgery settings.” Groups where the recommendations are more conditional/less generalizable include:
- **Very complex resections** (extended hepatectomy, vascular resection/reconstruction, re-resection, central bile duct resection, perihilar cholangiocarcinoma-type procedures)
- **Patients with significant underlying liver dysfunction** (cirrhosis, cholestasis/obstructive jaundice, MASLD with advanced fibrosis), where risks and thresholds differ and some interventions (for example inflow occlusion duration, drain decisions) may need individualized deviation
- **Patients with unusual comorbidity profiles** not represented in trials (for example severe frailty, severe cardiopulmonary limitation) where mobilization/fitness testing recommendations may not be feasible or safe without modification

Again, not a formal “exclusion,” but these are groups where you should not apply statements mechanically.

## 6) Patients for whom the guideline is **not intended to replace condition-specific guidance**
Some recommendations explicitly defer to other established protocols:
- **Simultaneous liver + colorectal resection**: prokinetics “with caution” and “based upon established colorectal protocols.”
- **MASLD management**: align with **EASL–EASD–EASO** guidance (so the consensus is not the primary disease-management guideline).

---

### Bottom line
There is **no single explicit exclusion list** in the consensus. Practically, you should consider the guideline **not applicable as-is** to: **non-hepatectomy patients (especially transplant), paediatric patients, patients with contraindications to key interventions (notably anticoagulation), and settings lacking the required procedural/imaging infrastructure**. For **high-complexity resections and severe liver dysfunction**, the guideline is intended to be **adapted**, not followed rigidly.

If you tell me which section you’re implementing (VTE prophylaxis, antibiotics, drains/bile leak, PHH prevention, PHLF monitoring), I can list the *section-specific* “cannot use / must modify” patient groups more concretely.",periop,exclusion_criteria_extraction
PMC7983964.txt,"## TARGET POPULATION (extracted from the guideline text)

This WSES position paper applies to **patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with an acute surgical condition during the COVID-19 pandemic**, specifically those who are **waiting for hospital admission and/or urgent/emergency surgery**.

The document repeatedly frames the population as **“acute surgical patients”** in the **emergency setting**, and then further segments them by **COVID-19 status** (confirmed, suspected/uncertain, negative) and by **urgency of surgery** (including cases where surgery cannot be delayed).

---

## Target population segment 1: All acute surgical patients in the ED needing admission/urgent surgery (symptomatic or not)

**Extracted population-defining text (key lines):**
- “**We recommend screening for COVID-19 infection at the emergency department all acute surgical patients who are waiting for hospital admission and urgent surgery.**”
- “**All acute surgical patients should complete preoperative COVID-19 screening… whether they are symptomatic or not**…”

**Significant details (what this includes):**
- Setting: **Emergency department / emergency surgical pathway**
- Clinical context: **acute surgical presentation** (e.g., acute abdomen and other emergency surgical diseases)
- Care stage: **pre-admission and preoperative** (before entering surgical ward/OR)
- Symptom status: **includes asymptomatic patients** (not limited to those with respiratory symptoms)

**Implied exclusions / out-of-scope (based on how the paper is written):**
- Not focused on elective/non-urgent surgery (it discusses postponing non-urgent surgery and concentrates on emergency/urgent care).
- Not a general COVID outpatient guideline; it is specific to **emergency surgical patient management**.

---

## Target population segment 2: Suspected COVID-19 acute surgical patients (clinical/epidemiologic suspicion)

**Extracted population-defining text (key lines):**
- “**COVID-19 infection is suspected in patients presenting with fever, cough, dyspnoea and/or recent direct contact with a confirmed COVID-19 patient**…”
- “At ED admission, a patient is defined ‘suspected’ for COVID-19 infection if…” (followed by WHO-style criteria: fever + respiratory symptoms + travel/residence in transmission area; acute respiratory illness + contact; severe respiratory infection requiring hospitalization with no other etiology)

**Significant details:**
- These are **acute surgical patients** who also meet **clinical and/or epidemiological features** suggesting SARS‑CoV‑2 infection.
- The guideline treats them as a high-risk group for **in-hospital transmission**, especially if surgery is needed before confirmation.

---

## Target population segment 3: “Uncertain” COVID-19 acute surgical patients (discordant/insufficient testing)

**Extracted population-defining text (key lines):**
- “**For individuals with a high clinical suspicion… with negative RT-PCR test, a combination of repeated… RT-PCR swab tests and chest imaging may be helpful**…”
- “**If the COVID-19 screening is not completed we recommend keeping the patient in isolation… and to manage him/she such as an overt COVID patient.**”
- “**Suspected/uncertain patients… those patients with RT-PCR swab test and thoracic radiological imaging result discrepancy**…”

**Significant details:**
- “Uncertain” includes patients with:
  - **negative RT-PCR but imaging/clinical picture suggestive**, or
  - **incomplete screening** when urgent surgery is required, or
  - **test/imaging discrepancy**.
- Management emphasis: **isolation** and **treat as COVID-positive** until clarified.

---

## Target population segment 4: Confirmed COVID-19 patients requiring emergency surgery

**Extracted population-defining text (key lines):**
- “**Indications for a surgical procedure are not different in confirmed COVID-19 patients**…”
- “**In evaluating the necessity to perform emergency surgery in COVID-19 (+)**…”
- “Patients needing for a surgical procedure or who have undergone urgent surgery with **confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection**…”

**Significant details:**
- These are **COVID-19 positive** patients who:
  - present with an emergency surgical disease, or
  - are already hospitalized for COVID-19 and then develop a surgical emergency.
- The paper highlights higher perioperative risk and the need for **multidisciplinary management**, PPE, dedicated pathways/wards/ICU as appropriate.

---

## Target population segment 5: COVID-negative acute surgical patients (after screening)

**Extracted population-defining text (key lines):**
- Patients “could be divided in **confirmed COVID-19 patients**, **suspected/uncertain**…, and **negative patients**.”
- “Disease-free patients can be transferred to the **regular surgical ward**…”

**Significant details:**
- These are emergency surgical patients who have completed screening and are considered **COVID-19 (–)**.
- The guideline’s focus here is mainly operational: preventing cross-contamination from false negatives and separating pathways/wards.

---

## Target population segment 6: Acute surgical patients needing immediate surgery before COVID status is confirmed (time-critical)

**Extracted population-defining text (key lines):**
- “**If an immediate surgical procedure is mandatory…**”
- “Surgery cannot be postponed for **class 1** (immediate surgery) and **class 2** (surgery in 1 h…) patients even if diagnosis of COVID-19 is not yet confirmed…”

**Significant details:**
- This segment is defined by **urgency**, not by COVID status.
- If testing is pending/unavailable/inconclusive, the patient is managed **as COVID-positive** for OR precautions.

**Emergency/acute surgical patients presenting in the ED during the COVID-19 pandemic who require hospital admission and/or urgent/emergency surgery (including those who are asymptomatic), stratified into COVID-19 confirmed, suspected/uncertain, and COVID-negative groups, with special consideration for time-critical (immediate/within 1 hour) surgical cases where COVID status may be unconfirmed.**",periop,target_population_extraction
PMC7983964.txt,"This WSES position paper is **not a “patient-use” guideline** (it is written for hospitals/clinicians). It does **not** define classic “exclusion criteria” the way a clinical trial would. Instead, it defines a **scope** (who it is meant for) and, by implication, who it is **not** meant to guide.

Below are the main groups of patients/situations in which this guideline **should not be used as the primary guidance** (or only applies partially), based on the paper’s stated purpose and content.

## 1) Patients who are **not emergency/acute surgical patients**
The document is specifically about **surgical patients in the emergency setting** during the COVID-19 pandemic (acute abdomen, urgent/emergent operations, urgent source control, etc.). Therefore it does **not** apply (or applies only indirectly) to:
- **Elective surgery** patients (planned, non-urgent operations)
- **Non-urgent benign surgery** that can be postponed
- Many **routine perioperative pathways** for scheduled cases (pre-admission testing, elective ERAS pathways, etc.)

## 2) Patients whose main problem is **non-surgical** (medical/ED presentations without a surgical condition)
It is not intended to guide management of:
- Patients presenting primarily for **medical COVID-19 care** without a surgical diagnosis
- Non-surgical emergencies (e.g., isolated cardiology/neurology/medical ICU problems) unless they develop a surgical complication requiring emergency surgical evaluation

## 3) Patients needing **specialty-specific emergency surgery not covered in the paper**
Although broad, the paper’s examples and recommendations focus mainly on **general emergency surgery** (abdominal emergencies, source control, OR precautions, perioperative isolation). It is not a complete guideline for:
- **Neurosurgical** emergencies
- **Cardiac/thoracic** emergencies (beyond general perioperative infection-control principles)
- **Obstetric** emergencies (e.g., C-section pathways)
- **Pediatric**-specific emergency surgery pathways (the paper does not provide pediatric-tailored recommendations)
- **Transplant** surgery pathways
- Other highly specialized surgical populations where separate society guidance is usually required

## 4) Patients in whom key recommendations are **not feasible due to resource constraints**
A major part of the paper assumes the ability to implement certain infection-control resources (or recommends transfer if not possible). If a hospital cannot provide these, the guideline’s pathway may not be usable as written for that patient:
- No ability to perform **RT-PCR testing** in a clinically useful timeframe
- No access to **chest imaging** (CT/CXR/lung US) to support screening
- No **dedicated COVID OR pathway**, negative-pressure/appropriate ventilation, or safe donning/doffing workflow
- Inadequate **PPE** or untrained staff to safely manage suspected/confirmed COVID cases in the OR

In these situations, the paper effectively says the “standard” pathway cannot be followed and suggests **treating as potentially infected** and/or **transferring stable patients to a COVID hub**—so local disaster/contingency protocols may supersede.

## 5) Patients for whom the paper gives **only limited, non-definitive direction**
Some patient groups are mentioned but not fully addressed with detailed protocols; for them, you should not rely on this paper alone:
- **Immunocompromised patients** (the paper explicitly calls for multidisciplinary discharge decisions; broader management needs other guidance)
- Patients needing detailed **COVID-directed pharmacologic treatment** decisions (the paper notes lack of specific therapy and emphasizes monitoring; it is not a COVID therapeutics guideline)
- Patients where decisions hinge on nuanced **anticoagulation/bleeding tradeoffs** beyond general LMWH prophylaxis principles (you’d need hematology/ICU guidance and updated evidence)

## 6) Patients outside the pandemic context the paper was written for
This is a **COVID-19 pandemic emergency-operations** position paper (early-pandemic evidence base, strong emphasis on preventing nosocomial spread and PPE/OR pathways). It is not designed for:
- Routine (non-surge) conditions where standard perioperative workflows apply
- Later-era contexts where testing, vaccination, variants, and therapeutics substantially change risk/operations (you’d need updated guidance)

---

### Practical takeaway
If a patient is **not an acute/emergency surgical patient**, or if they fall into a **highly specialized surgical population**, or if the hospital **cannot implement the required infection-control/testing/OR resources**, then this WSES paper should **not** be used as the sole or primary guideline; you should use specialty-specific and/or local/regional protocols.

If you tell me the patient category you’re thinking of (e.g., pediatrics, pregnancy, trauma, neurosurgery, immunosuppressed, elective-but-urgent cancer), I can map exactly which parts of the paper still apply and which don’t.",periop,exclusion_criteria_extraction
PMC12420935.txt,"## TARGET POPULATION (extracted from the guideline text)

### Primary target population (patients)
**Patients taking GLP‑1 receptor agonists (GLP‑1RAs) or dual GLP‑1/GIP receptor co‑agonists (GLP‑1/GIPRAs) who are presenting for procedures requiring anaesthesia/sedation and/or endoscopy.**

**Key details explicitly stated or clearly specified in the text:**
- **Medication exposure:** People using:
  - **GLP‑1RAs** (examples listed: **liraglutide** [Victoza, Saxenda], **dulaglutide** [Trulicity], **semaglutide** [Ozempic, Wegovy]; also mentions short-acting agents such as **exenatide** and **lixisenatide** in background discussion)
  - **GLP‑1/GIPRA:** **tirzepatide** (Mounjaro)
- **Indications for therapy included:** Use for **type 2 diabetes and/or obesity** (both are repeatedly referenced as the common reasons for being on these agents).
- **Clinical setting / trigger for inclusion:** “**Prior to anaesthesia or sedation for surgical and endoscopic procedures**” and “**peri-procedural**” management (includes surgery and GI endoscopy; gastroscopy is repeatedly discussed).
- **Risk focus:** Patients at potential risk of **retained gastric contents** and **pulmonary aspiration** due to GLP‑1RA/GLP‑1/GIPRA effects on **gastric emptying**.
- **Symptom status:** The guideline explicitly notes that **absence of GI symptoms should not be used** to rule out risk (so the target population includes patients **with or without** nausea/vomiting/upper GI symptoms).

---

## Segmented target populations (as implied by the recommendations)

### 1) Elective procedure patients on GLP‑1RA / GLP‑1/GIPRA
**Who:** Patients taking GLP‑1RAs or GLP‑1/GIPRAs who are scheduled for **elective** surgical or endoscopic procedures requiring sedation/anaesthesia.  
**Why they are singled out:** The guideline provides elective planning recommendations (e.g., **do not cease** GLP‑1RA/GLP‑1/GIPRA routinely; use **24‑hour clear fluid diet** + standard fasting).

### 2) Patients who did NOT complete the recommended 24‑hour clear fluid diet (higher-risk subgroup)
**Who:** Patients on GLP‑1RA/GLP‑1/GIPRA who **“have not withheld solids for 24 h”** or are **unable** to do the 24‑hour liquid diet.  
**Why they are singled out:** The guideline recommends **risk stratification/mitigation** for this subgroup, including:
- **Gastric ultrasound** to assess contents/volume
- **Minimally sedated/unsedated ultrathin gastroscopy** to directly visualise retained contents
- Consideration of **IV erythromycin** as a pro-motility strategy

### 3) Patients proceeding without mitigation/stratification (treat as “full stomach” subgroup)
**Who:** Patients on GLP‑1RA/GLP‑1/GIPRA where there has been **no**:
- 24‑hour clear fluid diet, **and**
- gastric ultrasound or ultrathin gastroscopy, **and/or**
- IV erythromycin (as discussed)
  
**How they are managed (and why this matters for “target population”):**
- The guideline states these patients should be considered **“non-fasted/to have a full stomach”** and managed with aspiration-risk precautions if proceeding.

---

## Secondary target population (intended users of the guideline)
While your examples focus on patient populations, this guideline also explicitly states who it is designed to support:

**Australian and New Zealand clinicians involved in peri-procedural care**, specifically:
- **Primary health practitioners**
- **Gastroenterologists**
- **Surgeons**
- **Endocrinologists**
- **Anaesthetists**
- **Perioperative physicians**

(These are the professional groups the guide is intended to help “support clinical decisions in these patients.”)

---

## Out-of-scope / not targeted (explicitly or by implication)
The document does **not** frame exclusions in the same way as oncology guidelines, but it **does** imply it is **not** about:
- General GLP‑1RA prescribing for diabetes/obesity outside the **peri-procedural** context
- Using **GI symptoms** alone to decide risk (explicitly discouraged as a stratification method)

If you upload the PDF/image of the guideline (or share the section headings/pages), I can extract the *exact* “Target population” wording if it exists as a labeled section and quote it verbatim.",periop,target_population_extraction
PMC12420935.txt,"These recommendations are **not written as a “patient eligibility” guideline** (i.e., they don’t provide a single list of “do not use in X patients”). They are intended to be applied broadly to **anyone taking a GLP‑1RA or GLP‑1/GIPRA who is having a procedure with sedation/anaesthesia**, and then modified based on feasibility and contraindications to the mitigation steps.

That said, there are clear **practical exclusion / non-applicability situations**—patients in whom you **cannot follow the pathway as written** (or key components of it), so you must use an alternative local/individualised plan.

## 1) Patients who are *not in scope* of the guideline
These recommendations apply to **peri‑procedural management** of:
- **GLP‑1 receptor agonists** (e.g., semaglutide, liraglutide, dulaglutide, exenatide, lixisenatide)
- **Dual GLP‑1/GIP agonist** (tirzepatide)

So the guideline is **not intended** for:
- Patients **not taking** a GLP‑1RA/GLP‑1/GIPRA
- Patients taking **other diabetes/weight drugs only** (e.g., SGLT2 inhibitors, DPP‑4 inhibitors, insulin, metformin) unless combined with GLP‑1 therapy
- Situations unrelated to sedation/anaesthesia/endoscopy (e.g., routine outpatient care)

## 2) Patients who cannot comply with the core risk-reduction step (24‑hour clear-fluid diet)
A central recommendation is **24 h clear fluids + standard 6 h fasting**. The guideline’s “default” pathway doesn’t work as written if the patient:
- **Cannot safely tolerate a 24‑hour clear-fluid diet** (e.g., frailty/malnutrition risk, some complex metabolic situations, clinician concern about dehydration/electrolytes)
- **Cannot practically complete it** (cognitive impairment without support, poor access to appropriate fluids, non-adherence, late notification of GLP‑1 use)

In these cases, the guideline moves to **risk stratification/mitigation** (gastric ultrasound, ultrathin gastroscopy, erythromycin) or treats as **full stomach**—but if those options also aren’t possible, the guideline is effectively **not implementable as intended**.

## 3) Patients in whom the recommended “risk stratification” tools are unavailable or unsuitable
If the patient hasn’t done the 24‑h clear-fluid diet, the guideline suggests:
- **Point-of-care gastric ultrasound**, or
- **Minimally sedated/unsedated ultrathin gastroscopy**

The pathway becomes difficult or non-applicable when:
- **Gastric ultrasound is not available** (equipment/trained operator) or is expected to be **unreliable** in that setting (operator limitations, local capability)
- **Ultrathin gastroscopy is not available**, or the patient is **unlikely to tolerate it** (severe gagging/retching risk, inability to cooperate, significant anxiety, communication barriers without support)

In those circumstances, the guideline’s remaining option is to manage as **non-fasted/full stomach** or defer—so the “standard” pathway can’t be followed.

## 4) Patients who cannot receive erythromycin (when it is being used as mitigation)
The guideline says it is *reasonable* to use **IV erythromycin** to counter delayed gastric emptying, but explicitly notes: **contraindications must be considered**.

So the erythromycin mitigation step is **excluded** for patients with typical erythromycin contraindications/cautions, such as:
- **Macrolide allergy**
- Clinically significant **QT prolongation** or high arrhythmia risk, or taking other strong **QT‑prolonging** drugs where additive risk is unacceptable
- Important **drug–drug interactions** (erythromycin is a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor; interaction risk depends on the patient’s medication list)
- Other clinician-determined reasons erythromycin is unsafe in that individual

(These are not exhaustively listed in the excerpt, but “contraindications should be considered” means you must screen for them.)

## 5) Patients where proceeding “as full stomach” is not acceptable and deferral is not possible
If no mitigation is possible (no 24‑h clear fluids, no ultrasound/gastroscopy, no erythromycin), the guideline states the patient should be considered **non-fasted/full stomach** and anaesthetised accordingly, **or** the procedure deferred.

This becomes a “cannot use the guideline as intended” scenario when:
- The procedure is **urgent/emergent** and cannot be deferred, **and**
- The team cannot safely deliver anaesthesia using a **full-stomach/aspiration-risk** approach in that context (local resource/skill constraints, airway risk profile, etc.)

In practice, you still use the *principle* (treat as full stomach), but the guideline doesn’t provide a more specific alternative beyond local full-stomach protocols.

## 6) Patients for whom “symptom-based reassurance” would be used
This is an important *negative* exclusion: the guideline explicitly says you **cannot** use:
- **Absence of GI symptoms** (no nausea/vomiting/bloating)  
as a criterion to declare the patient “low risk” or “safe/fasted.”

So any patient pathway that relies on “no symptoms = okay” is **excluded by the guideline**.

---

### Bottom line
There isn’t a single “these patients cannot use the guideline” list. Instead, the guideline is meant for **all GLP‑1RA/GLP‑1/GIPRA users undergoing sedation/anaesthesia**, but it becomes **non-applicable or requires deviation** when patients **cannot do the 24‑h clear-fluid diet**, when **ultrasound/ultrathin gastroscopy aren’t feasible**, or when **erythromycin is contraindicated**, leaving only “treat as full stomach” or “defer.”

If you tell me the **procedure type** (endoscopy vs surgery), **urgency** (elective vs emergency), and whether the patient can do **24‑h clear fluids**, I can map exactly which branches of the guideline remain usable.",periop,exclusion_criteria_extraction
PMC11072254.txt,"## TARGET POPULATION (extracted from the provided guideline text)

This position paper does **not** contain a single, explicit “Target Population” section written in the same way as your melanoma/PSA/breast cancer examples. However, the target population is clearly described throughout the document. Below is the **best-faith extraction of the target population language**, organized into **distinct target-population segments** that the guideline repeatedly references.

---

## 1) Broad / Overall Target Population (Digestive surgery patients in the perioperative period)

**Extracted target-population text (verbatim or near-verbatim from the guideline):**
- “**digestive surgery patients**”
- “**patients undergoing digestive procedures**”
- “**patients undergoing digestive procedures**” / “**patients undergoing digestive procedures, especially in oncology**”
- “**patients following abdominal surgery**”
- “**patients with digestive anastomosis**”
- “**elective digestive procedures**”
- “**uncomplicated digestive surgery**”
- “**digestive surgery**” (as the overall scope: “perioperative care in digestive surgery”)

**Significant details implied by the document:**
- Applies to patients managed under **enhanced recovery programs (ERPs)**, specifically **ERAS** and **ACERTO**, across **preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative** phases.
- The scope is **perioperative care** (education, nutrition, fasting, fluids, mobilization, PONV prophylaxis, bowel prep, symbiotics, analgesia, early feeding, discharge planning).

**Practical summary of this target population:**
Patients undergoing **digestive (gastrointestinal) surgery**, particularly in **elective** settings, who are candidates for perioperative care pathways consistent with **ERAS/ACERTO** principles.

---

## 2) Elective Digestive Surgery Patients (explicitly referenced subgroup)

**Extracted target-population text:**
- “**elective digestive procedures**”
- “The enhanced recovery protocols such as ERAS and ACERTO recommend **no preoperative IV fluids in elective surgery when the patient is in good condition**”
- “abbreviation protocol of preoperative fasting can be used in **most elective digestive surgeries**”

**Significant details:**
- Many recommendations (e.g., shortened fasting, carbohydrate/clear fluids up to 2 hours pre-anesthesia, avoidance of routine preop IV fluids) are framed around **elective** cases and **patients in good condition**.

**Practical summary:**
Elective digestive surgery patients—especially those in **stable condition**—are a primary intended population for ERP elements like shortened fasting, early feeding, and restrictive fluids.

---

## 3) Digestive Surgery Patients with High Malnutrition Risk (especially oncology)

**Extracted target-population text:**
- “Surgical patients who are candidates to digestive procedures, **especially in oncology, have a high prevalence of malnutrition** alone or associated with sarcopenia”
- “Adequate nutritional status approach before a **moderate to major surgical procedure** has been consistently regarded as highly important”
- Immune nutrition benefits: “with at least **five days** of immune-enhanced nutrition preoperatively in **major procedures** and continuing for **seven days postoperatively in cases of severe malnutrition**”

**Significant details:**
- Includes patients undergoing **moderate-to-major** digestive operations.
- Highlights those with **malnutrition and/or sarcopenia**, common in **oncologic digestive surgery**.
- Mentions nutrition modalities: **oral supplementation, enteral feeding, parenteral nutrition**, or combinations, initiated **as soon as surgery is decided** (INTERNUTI concept).

**Practical summary:**
Digestive surgery patients—particularly **oncology** patients and those with **malnutrition/sarcopenia**—are a key subgroup for early and structured perioperative nutritional intervention (including immune-enhancing nutrition in selected cases).

---

## 4) Patients Undergoing Abdominal Surgery (including those with GI anastomosis) for early feeding recommendations

**Extracted target-population text:**
- “early postoperative feeding following **abdominal surgery**, even with a **gastrointestinal anastomosis**, is currently recognized to be safe”
- “Feeding shortly after abdominal surgery even with anastomosis…”
- “early postoperative feeding can be initiated even in the postoperative recovery room”

**Significant details:**
- Explicitly includes patients with **digestive anastomoses** (a group historically kept NPO longer).
- Emphasizes **early oral/enteral feeding**, including **protein-containing diets**.

**Practical summary:**
Patients after **abdominal digestive surgery**, including those with **GI anastomosis**, are within scope for **early postoperative feeding** recommendations.

---

## 5) Patients for whom shortened preoperative fasting is appropriate—and those excluded/contraindicated

### Included (most elective digestive surgeries)
**Extracted target-population text:**
- “Although this abbreviation protocol of preoperative fasting can be used in **most elective digestive surgeries**…”

### Contraindicated / outside this specific recommendation
**Extracted contraindication text (functions like an exclusion list):**
- “there are contraindications…: **gastroparesis, intestinal obstruction, ileus, use of semaglutide or anti-spasmodic drug, and in critically-ill patients**”

**Significant details:**
- The guideline supports clear fluids/carbohydrate loading up to 2 hours pre-anesthesia for many patients, but explicitly flags groups where this may not apply.

**Practical summary:**
Most **elective** digestive surgery patients are included for shortened fasting/carbohydrate drink strategies, **excluding** (or requiring special caution in) patients with **gastroparesis, obstruction/ileus, certain medications (semaglutide/antispasmodics), or critical illness**.

---

## 6) “Uncomplicated” Digestive Surgery Patients (fluid management focus)

**Extracted target-population text:**
- “How to prescribe intravenous crystalloid fluids in **uncomplicated digestive surgery**?”
- “Patients undergoing **minor surgeries** such as inguinal herniorrhaphy and orificial anal procedures may not need IV fluids postoperatively…”

**Significant details:**
- Focuses on avoiding fluid overload and aiming for “zero balance,” especially when early oral intake is feasible.
- Mentions **minor procedures** as a subgroup where IV fluids may be unnecessary post-op.

**Practical summary:**
Patients undergoing **uncomplicated** digestive surgery (and especially **minor** procedures) are a target group for **restrictive IV crystalloid strategies** and early oral hydration.

---

## 7) Colorectal surgery patients (explicitly referenced in evidence statements)

**Extracted target-population text:**
- Meta-analysis: “multimodal prehabilitation… in patients undergoing **colorectal surgery**”
- Early protein diet: “may reduce mortality in **colorectal surgery**”
- Bowel prep: “debates in **colorectal surgery**”; “MBP is not necessary before a **right colectomy**”

**Significant details:**
- While the paper is broadly “digestive surgery,” it repeatedly uses **colorectal surgery** as a key evidence base and example population.

**Practical summary:**
Colorectal surgery patients are a prominently referenced subgroup for **prehabilitation**, **early feeding (protein)**, and **selective/no mechanical bowel preparation** (e.g., right colectomy).

---

### If you want, I can convert the above into a single standardized “TARGET POPULATION” block (like your examples) with **Inclusions / Exclusions / Key subgroups**—but the guideline itself does not present it in that single-block format, so the above reflects what is actually stated across the text you provided.",periop,target_population_extraction
PMC11072254.txt,"The paper is a **position statement** on applying ERAS/ACERTO principles to **digestive surgery**, and it does **not** provide a single, global “do-not-use” list for the entire protocol. Instead, it makes clear that ERAS/ACERTO is intended mainly for **elective, clinically stable patients**, and it lists (or implies) **contraindications/exclusions for specific components**. In practice, these are the patient groups in whom you **should not apply the guideline as written (or you must substantially modify it)**:

## 1) Patients in whom the “shortened preoperative fasting + carbohydrate drink” strategy should NOT be used
The text explicitly states that abbreviated fasting/clear carbohydrate fluids up to 2 hours pre-anesthesia is usable in “most elective digestive surgeries,” **but contraindicated** in:

- **Gastroparesis** (delayed gastric emptying → aspiration risk)
- **Intestinal obstruction**
- **Ileus**
- **Use of semaglutide (GLP‑1 receptor agonists)** (delays gastric emptying; aspiration concern)
- **Use of antispasmodic drugs** (as cited by the paper; concern relates to altered GI motility/emptying)
- **Critically ill patients**

These patients are not necessarily excluded from *all* ERAS/ACERTO care, but they are excluded from this key element and therefore cannot follow the protocol “as-is.”

## 2) Critically ill / unstable patients (broader ERAS limitations)
Beyond fasting, the paper also flags **critically ill patients** as a group where standard ERP elements may not be appropriate. In real-world terms, patients with **hemodynamic instability, shock, severe sepsis, or ICU-level instability** often cannot follow core ERP items (early feeding, early mobilization, restrictive fluids) without individualized critical-care adaptation.

## 3) Patients in whom “symbiotics” (probiotic/prebiotic combinations) may be inappropriate
The paper includes symbiotics in ACERTO but cautions that:

- **Patients with a compromised immune system** require “careful evaluation” before use.

So, **immunocompromised patients** (e.g., profound immunosuppression, some chemotherapy states, transplant recipients, severe neutropenia—depending on local policy) are not ideal candidates for routine symbiotics per this position paper; this element should be avoided or decided case-by-case.

## 4) Patients/procedures where “early oral/enteral feeding” cannot be safely implemented as written
The paper strongly supports early feeding even with anastomosis, but it also assumes an **uncomplicated postoperative course**. Patients who often cannot follow early feeding pathways without modification include those with:
- **Persistent ileus**, obstruction, uncontrolled vomiting, or high aspiration risk
- **Hemodynamic instability** or need for escalating vasopressors
- **Complications requiring reoperation or prolonged ventilation**
(These are not listed as a formal exclusion list in the paper, but they are inherent clinical situations where the ERP feeding element cannot be applied.)

## 5) Patients in whom “restrictive IV crystalloid strategy / no routine IV fluids” is not appropriate
The paper recommends restrictive fluids in “uncomplicated” surgery and notes appropriateness depends on comorbidities and procedure. Patients who typically cannot follow a strict restrictive/no-IV-fluid approach without tailoring include those with:
- **Significant hemodynamic instability or major ongoing losses**
- **High-risk comorbidities requiring individualized fluid targets** (e.g., advanced cardiac/renal disease)
Again, not framed as a strict exclusion in the paper, but explicitly described as requiring individualization.

## 6) Non-elective contexts (implied limitation)
Most recommendations are framed around **elective digestive surgery** (prehabilitation, carbohydrate loading, planned early feeding/mobilization, discharge planning). Therefore, patients undergoing:
- **Emergency/urgent digestive surgery**
often cannot receive the protocol in full (no time for prehabilitation, nutrition optimization, carbohydrate loading, etc.). This is an implied “cannot use as written” group.

---

### Practical takeaway
If you need a clean “exclusion criteria” statement consistent with the paper: **patients who are critically ill/unstable, have impaired gastric emptying or bowel obstruction/ileus, or are on semaglutide (and those on antispasmodics as cited) should not undergo the abbreviated fasting/carbohydrate-loading component; immunocompromised patients should not routinely receive symbiotics; and emergency/complicated cases require major modification rather than standard ERAS/ACERTO application.**

If you tell me **which specific surgery** (e.g., colectomy, gastrectomy, pancreatic surgery) and whether you mean **exclude from the whole pathway vs. exclude from specific items**, I can turn this into a checklist suitable for a local protocol.",periop,exclusion_criteria_extraction
PMC5629911.txt,"## TARGET POPULATION (extracted from the provided guideline text)

### Overall scope / intended population (guideline-wide)
This guideline is written for **patients in the perioperative setting who are undergoing (or being considered for) surgery—primarily noncardiac surgery—where cardiovascular risk assessment and management are relevant**, and for the clinicians involved in that care (cardiologists, surgeons, anesthesiologists, intensivists).

Key scope signals in the text:
- The document is explicitly a **“Guidelines for Perioperative Cardiovascular Evaluation”** and is framed from a **cardiologist’s point of view**.
- It repeatedly addresses **“patients scheduled for surgical procedures”** and focuses on **perioperative risk assessment, monitoring, and cardiovascular management**.
- It includes guidance for **elective, urgent, and emergency surgeries**, with different recommendations depending on timing/urgency.

---

## Target populations explicitly defined for specific sections (segmented)

### 1) General preoperative evaluation population
**Patients scheduled for surgical procedures (especially noncardiac surgery) who require perioperative cardiovascular evaluation**, including:
- Patients undergoing **low-, intermediate-, or high-risk** procedures (intrinsic procedural risk is discussed).
- Patients with varying **functional capacity** and comorbidity burden.
- Both **elective** and **urgent/emergency** surgical candidates (with different evaluation intensity).

**Important exclusions/limits stated in the text**
- In **emergency surgery**, the cardiologist’s role is mainly **monitoring and risk-reduction interventions**, and **tests that delay surgery are not indicated**.

---

### 2) Patients with “severe cardiovascular conditions” where elective surgery should be postponed
The guideline identifies a subgroup where **baseline cardiovascular instability makes spontaneous perioperative risk very high regardless of procedure**, and therefore:
- **Elective surgery should be postponed** when possible until the condition is treated/compensated.

(Your excerpt references this concept but does not list the full set of “severe conditions” in the visible text; it clearly defines the *population concept* and the management implication.)

---

### 3) Patients undergoing **low-risk procedures** (special perioperative medication/bleeding considerations)
The guideline provides specific perioperative management guidance for patients undergoing low-risk procedures, especially around antithrombotics:

**Target population includes patients undergoing:**
- **Dental procedures**
- **Dermatological procedures**
- **Endoscopic procedures**
- **Ophthalmologic procedures**

**Key population features emphasized**
- Many of these patients are on **antiplatelet agents and/or oral anticoagulants** (including warfarin and NOACs).
- The guideline focuses on balancing **bleeding risk of the procedure** vs **thrombotic risk of stopping therapy**.

---

### 4) Patients with specific cardiovascular diseases/conditions in the perioperative period
These sections define target populations as **surgical candidates who have (known or suspected) cardiovascular disease**, including:

- **Coronary artery disease (CAD)** patients undergoing surgery  
- **Systemic arterial hypertension** patients (especially uncontrolled HTN; stage 2 HTN thresholds are mentioned)
- **Heart failure (HF)** patients (including reduced EF and preserved EF)
- **Valvular heart disease** patients (aortic stenosis, mitral stenosis, regurgitant lesions, valve prostheses)
- **Arrhythmia** patients (AF/flutter, supraventricular tachycardias, ventricular ectopy/VT, hereditary channelopathies)
- **Conduction disorders** (including those who may need temporary pacing)
- **Patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs)**: pacemakers, ICDs, resynchronizers  
  - Includes special subgroups: **CIED implanted <60 days**, **near end-of-life battery depletion**, **ICD patients**, etc.

**Common thread:** these are **patients with these conditions who are undergoing noncardiac surgery** (or perioperative care around procedures).

---

### 5) Transplant candidates (special populations)
The guideline has dedicated perioperative cardiovascular evaluation content for transplant candidates:

#### 5A) **Liver transplant candidates**
Target population:
- **Candidates for liver transplantation** (patients with terminal liver disease) requiring cardiovascular investigation and risk management.

Important details included:
- High rate of peri-/post-transplant cardiac events (arrhythmias, pulmonary edema, systolic dysfunction, MI, sudden death).
- Evaluation is challenging due to cirrhosis-related hemodynamics and test limitations.
- Specific comorbidity subgroups discussed:
  - Cirrhosis-associated cardiomyopathy
  - Alcohol-related cardiomyopathy
  - Port-pulmonary hypertension
  - Hepatopulmonary syndrome
  - CAD in cirrhotics

#### 5B) **Kidney transplant candidates**
Target population is defined very explicitly:
- **Renal transplant candidates with terminal renal disease**, with the section’s recommendations applying **only to:**
  - **Asymptomatic patients or patients with atypical symptoms** being evaluated for CAD risk.

And explicitly **not** applying to:
- Patients with **clinical evidence and/or diagnostic investigations suggestive of coronary disease**—those should be managed per general-population CAD rules.

Key details:
- Goal is identifying those most likely to have **relevant CAD** (e.g., stenosis ≥70%).
- Risk factors emphasized: **age >50**, **diabetes**, **prior evidence of cardiovascular disease**, plus others (HTN, LVH, smoking, dyslipidemia, dialysis >1 year).
- Notes that noninvasive tests have **lower sensitivity/specificity** in this population.

---

### 6) Bariatric surgery candidates
Target population:
- **Patients with obesity being considered for bariatric/metabolic surgery**.

Important details:
- Mentions contraindications (e.g., type 1 diabetes, substance abuse, uncontrolled psychiatric disease, lack of understanding/commitment).
- Discusses risk stratification factors (e.g., BMI thresholds, OSA, prior VTE/PTE risk, HTN, age >45, male sex, low functional capacity).

---

### 7) Patients with major comorbidities relevant to perioperative cardiovascular risk
The guideline includes perioperative considerations for comorbidity-defined populations, including:

- **Diabetes mellitus** patients (including special considerations for **type 1 DM** and **emergency surgery in DM**)
- **Thyroid disease** patients (hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism/thyrotoxicosis)
- **Adrenal insufficiency** (patients with known AI or at risk, including chronic steroid users)
- **Obesity** (including OSA screening; BMI classes)
- **Hematologic disorders** (anemia, thrombocytopenia, thrombophilias/antiphospholipid antibodies, hemophilia, von Willebrand disease)
- **Renal failure** (including dialysis and transplant recipients)
- **Pulmonary hypertension**
- **Asthma/COPD**
- **Smokers** (perioperative cessation strategies)

These are all framed as **patients with these conditions who are undergoing surgery** and need perioperative risk reduction.

---

## Consolidated “one-line” target population statement (faithful to the text)
**Adults undergoing surgical procedures (primarily noncardiac surgery), including elective and urgent/emergency cases, who require perioperative cardiovascular risk assessment and management—especially those with cardiovascular disease, significant comorbidities, implantable cardiac devices, or those undergoing special procedures (e.g., transplants, bariatric surgery, vascular surgery, and low-risk procedures where antithrombotic management is relevant).**

So the main “exclusion criteria” are situations where (a) the guideline’s scope does not apply, or (b) the guideline itself states that its algorithms/recommendations should not be used as written.

Below are the patient groups/situations that **cannot use this guideline (or cannot use key parts of it) as intended**.

---

## 1) Patients undergoing **cardiac surgery**
The document is written for **noncardiac surgery**. Patients scheduled for:
- CABG, valve surgery, aortic surgery performed as cardiac surgery, etc.

…should be managed using **cardiac‑surgery–specific** perioperative guidance, not this one.

---

## 2) **Emergency surgery** patients (no time for “full” preop stratification)
The guideline explicitly distinguishes emergency/urgent vs elective surgery:

### Emergency surgery
If the underlying condition requires **immediate surgery**, the cardiologist’s role is mainly:
- monitoring and risk‑mitigation measures intra/post‑op

And the guideline states there is **no indication for tests that delay surgery**.

So, **the elective risk‑stratification flowcharts and “work‑up” steps are not applicable** in the usual way.

### Urgent surgery
There may be time for limited optimization (e.g., echo if indicated), but the guideline states that **functional ischemia tests should not be ordered** if the result will not change management because surgery cannot be postponed long enough (e.g., to allow revascularization/DAPT timing).

---

## 3) Patients with **“severe cardiovascular conditions” that must be treated first**
For **elective** surgery, the guideline says surgery should be **postponed** when the patient has a very high spontaneous risk “regardless of the procedure,” until compensated/treated.

So these patients **cannot be “cleared” using the routine algorithm** until stabilized. Examples described across the text include (conceptually):
- **Decompensated/acute heart failure**
- **Uncontrolled severe arrhythmias** (e.g., AF with very high ventricular response; the text cites >120 bpm as a “severe cardiovascular condition” requiring postponement until controlled)
- **Severe/symptomatic valvular disease** needing valve intervention first (e.g., symptomatic severe aortic stenosis; severe mitral stenosis with indication for intervention)
- **Unstable coronary syndromes/active ischemia** (managed as ACS, not routine clearance)

In short: if the patient is unstable, the guideline’s “standard clearance pathway” is not to be used; stabilization takes priority.

---

## 4) Populations where the guideline itself says its recommendations apply **only to a subset**
These are not “excluded from the whole guideline,” but they **are excluded from specific sections/algorithms**:

### A) Kidney transplant candidates: symptomatic CAD
In the kidney transplant section, the guideline states its proposed CAD‑screening strategy applies **only to**:
- **asymptomatic** patients or those with **atypical symptoms**

And it explicitly excludes:
- patients with **clinical evidence and/or tests suggestive of CAD** → these should be investigated/treated per **general CAD rules**, not the transplant screening algorithm.

### B) NOAC/DOAC perioperative management in certain procedures
For some low‑risk procedures (dental/endoscopic/ophthalmologic), the guideline repeatedly notes that evidence for **NOACs** is limited and “no recommendations established” in some settings. Practically, that means patients on NOACs in those scenarios **cannot rely on a firm guideline‑based protocol** and require individualized management.

---

## 5) Situations where the guideline says a test/strategy is **not recommended** (so patients “can’t use” that part)
This is a common source of confusion: the patient isn’t excluded from the guideline, but they are excluded from **using certain tools**. Examples explicitly stated:

- **Routine preop testing** (labs, ECG, chest X‑ray) in **asymptomatic low‑risk** patients: not indicated.
- **Coronary CT angiography / calcium score** for routine preop risk stratification: not recommended.
- **Routine Holter** for ischemia screening: not recommended.
- **Routine ABI** for perioperative risk estimation: not recommended.
- **Routine invasive coronary angiography** as a substitute for noninvasive tests: not recommended.

So if a patient’s plan depends on one of these “routine” strategies, the guideline says **don’t apply it**.

---

## 6) Procedures/patient contexts with **separate, specialized guidance**
The guideline includes some special topics (e.g., transplants, bariatric surgery, pulmonary hypertension), but it also points out that some areas have **their own dedicated guideline** and should be managed primarily there. Example:
- **Arterial vascular surgery**: it refers to a separate vascular‑surgery perioperative guideline as the main detailed source.

---

### Practical takeaway
A patient should **not** be managed using this guideline’s standard perioperative evaluation/clearance pathway if they are:
1) having **cardiac surgery**, or  
2) having **emergency surgery** (no time for the algorithmic work‑up), or  
3) **clinically unstable** with a severe active cardiac condition that should be treated/compensated first, or  
4) in a subgroup where the guideline limits applicability (e.g., **kidney transplant CAD screening** only for asymptomatic/atypical patients).

If you tell me the **type of surgery** and the patient’s key cardiac problems (CAD? HF? valve disease? AF? stent/DAPT? anticoagulant?), I can map exactly whether the guideline applies and which parts do not.",periop,exclusion_criteria_extraction

If you upload the PDF or provide the full guideline text for Part 1 and Part 3 as well, I can extract and present a single consolidated “TARGET POPULATION” section exactly as written across the full guideline set (and reconcile any differences between parts).",periop,target_population_extraction
PMC12338449.txt,"The ERATIC (trauma ERAS) recommendations are **not a “one-size-fits-all” protocol**. They are written for **adult major trauma/polytrauma patients in the post‑resuscitation phase**, especially those **requiring ICU and/or postoperative care**. Patients fall “outside” the guideline (or require major modification/individualization) in two main ways:

1) **They are not the population the guideline targets** (scope exclusions).
2) **They have clinical features where key ERAS/ICU elements cannot be safely applied as written** (practical/clinical exclusions or “do not apply without specialist tailoring”).

Below are the exclusion criteria in that sense—i.e., **which patients cannot use the guideline as written**.

---

## 1) Scope exclusions (patients the guideline is not intended for)

### A. Minor trauma / non–ICU-requiring trauma
- Patients with **isolated minor injuries** or those managed entirely as outpatients/short-stay admissions.
- The document repeatedly frames its target as **major trauma/polytrauma** and the **ICU-requiring group**; applying ICU-focused elements (ventilation strategies, RRT, ECMO, etc.) to minor trauma is not appropriate.

### B. Elective (non-trauma) surgical patients
- Standard ERAS pathways for elective surgery exist; ERATIC is specifically trauma-focused and extrapolates from elective ERAS only where needed.

### C. Pediatric patients (children/adolescents)
- The text and evidence base are overwhelmingly **adult ICU/trauma literature** (e.g., ARDSnet-style ventilation, adult VTE prophylaxis trials, adult sedation/withdrawal practices).
- Pediatric trauma has different physiology, dosing, and risk profiles; therefore **children should not be managed under this guideline without pediatric-specific adaptation**.

### D. Patients in the *prehospital* or *initial resuscitation-room* phase (for this paper)
- This is **Paper 2: postoperative and ICU recommendations**. It is not meant to guide the earliest resuscitation decisions (those are addressed in other parts of the ERATIC series).

---

## 2) Clinical situations where the guideline cannot be applied “as written” (must be individualized or deferred)

Even within major trauma, several recommendations explicitly depend on **stability, bleeding control, neurologic status, and operative plans**. In these situations, patients cannot “use” the guideline in a protocolized way; elements must be delayed/modified.

### A. Ongoing uncontrolled hemorrhage / active bleeding or profound physiologic instability
Many ERAS-style steps (early mobilization, early feeding, early line/drain removal, standard anticoagulant prophylaxis) assume the patient is **post-resuscitation** and **hemostasis is achieved**.
- Examples of elements that often **cannot** be applied until bleeding is controlled:
  - **Early pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis** (contraindicated with active hemorrhage)
  - **Early mobilization**
  - **Early extubation/weaning**
  - **Early enteral feeding** if shock/vasopressor escalation or gut ischemia risk is present

### B. Severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) or unstable intracranial hemorrhage
The guideline itself flags severe TBI as a major modifier, especially for:
- **Early mobilization**: the mobilization section explicitly notes exceptions (“except severe TBI…”).
- **Ventilation targets**: permissive hypercapnia is cautioned against in TBI contexts (noted in pulmonary contusion discussion).
- **VTE prophylaxis timing**: pharmacologic prophylaxis depends on **repeat CT stability** and neurosurgical plans:
  - If **intracranial bleeding is progressing** or the patient is **high risk** / needs **urgent neurosurgery**, LMWH is **delayed case-by-case**.
- **Temperature management**: hyperthermia is particularly harmful in brain injury; TTM decisions differ if cerebral perfusion was compromised.

**Practical exclusion:** patients with **severe/unstable TBI** cannot follow the “standard early” components; they require neurocritical-care–driven tailoring.

### C. Patients requiring urgent neurosurgical or spinal procedures (high bleeding-consequence surgery)
- The guideline specifically distinguishes **neurosurgery/spinal procedures** as situations where holding anticoagulant doses may be justified.
- Therefore, patients in whom imminent neurosurgical/spinal intervention is planned cannot follow the “don’t withhold LMWH for most procedures” concept in a blanket way.

### D. Orthopedic injuries with strict weight-bearing or movement restrictions
- Early mobilization is encouraged, but the guideline explicitly carves out **orthopedic restrictions**.
- Patients with unstable pelvic fractures, certain spine fractures, complex long-bone injuries, external fixation constraints, etc., may not be able to mobilize per protocol.

### E. Discontinuous gastrointestinal tract / open abdomen / damage-control surgery states (until anatomy/physiology allows)
Some ERAS nutrition and tube/drain removal concepts assume a “functional gut” and relative stability.
- **Discontinuous gut (“clip and drop”)**: early full enteral feeding is not applicable; PN is considered around day 3–5 if continuity cannot be restored.
- **Open abdomen/TAC**: drain/tube strategies and feeding/mobilization are often constrained by ongoing staged operations and abdominal domain issues.

These patients are not excluded from ERATIC overall, but **they cannot use the “standard early feeding/removal/mobilization” parts** until their surgical situation changes.

### F. Patients who are not awake/cooperative enough for noninvasive ventilation (NIV)
The NIV section states a key safety requirement:
- The patient must be **awake enough to remove the mask** and must have immediate access to intubation if NIV fails.

So patients with:
- depressed consciousness,
- inability to protect airway,
- uncontrolled vomiting/aspiration risk,
- severe facial trauma preventing mask seal,
generally **cannot use NIV recommendations** and need invasive airway management.

### G. Contraindications driven by organ failure or high complication risk (element-specific)
Some recommendations are conditional on organ function:
- **NSAIDs** as opioid-sparing adjuncts: suggested only after ~72h and **only if no renal dysfunction or GI bleeding risk**.
- **Lidocaine infusions, dexmedetomidine, ketamine**: require hemodynamic/arrhythmia considerations and local monitoring capability.
- **ECMO**: requires institutional capability and careful bleeding/TBI risk balancing; not universally applicable.

---

## 3) A key “meta-exclusion”: settings where required resources/monitoring are unavailable
ERATIC includes recommendations that assume access to:
- ICU staffing and protocols (sedation scales, delirium screening, mobilization teams)
- dynamic coagulation testing (TEG/ROTEM) *if available*
- ECMO capability
- bronchoscopy for aspiration evaluation
- BIS monitoring *if available* when paralyzed

If these are not available, patients are not “excluded,” but **the guideline cannot be implemented as intended** and must be adapted to local resources.

---

# Bottom line
Patients who **cannot use this guideline as written** are mainly:
- **children**, **minor trauma/non-ICU trauma**, and **non-trauma elective patients** (scope);
and, within major trauma,
- those with **uncontrolled bleeding/instability**, **severe or unstable TBI**, **imminent neurosurgical/spinal procedures**, **strict orthopedic restrictions**, **damage-control/open abdomen/discontinuous gut states** (for certain ERAS elements), or **inability to safely use NIV**.

If you tell me the patient group you’re writing this for (e.g., “adult polytrauma ICU protocol” vs “all trauma admissions”), I can rewrite the exclusion criteria as a clean checklist suitable for a hospital guideline document.",periop,exclusion_criteria_extraction
PMC5029585.txt,"## TARGET POPULATION (extracted from the guideline text)

### 1) Core target population (overall scope)
**Patients who are obese undergoing anaesthesia and surgery (peri‑operative setting).**  
- The guideline is written for the **organisational and clinical peri‑operative management of anaesthesia and surgery for patients who are obese**.  
- It applies broadly across the peri‑operative pathway: **pre‑operative assessment/preparation, intra‑operative management, and postoperative care**.

**How “obese” is defined/operationalised in the document**
- The guideline uses **BMI-based obesity classification (WHO class system)** (table referenced but not reproduced in the provided text).
- It repeatedly highlights higher-risk subgroups within obesity, especially:
  - **Central (visceral) obesity** and **metabolic syndrome** as key risk amplifiers.
  - **Sleep‑disordered breathing** (OSA/OHS), often undiagnosed, as a major peri‑operative risk driver.

---

## Target-population subgroups explicitly addressed (segmented)

### 2) Higher-risk obese patients (risk-stratified subgroup within the obese surgical population)
The guideline distinguishes that not all obese patients have the same peri‑operative risk:
- “The vast majority of obese patients presenting for surgery are relatively healthy and their peri‑operative risk is similar to that of patients of normal weight.”
- **Patients at high risk** are particularly those with:
  - **Central obesity and metabolic syndrome** (identified as risk factors)
  - **High VTE risk**
  - **Sleep‑disordered breathing**, especially:
    - **Undiagnosed OSA**
    - **OSA patients unable to tolerate CPAP**
    - **OHS** (defined in-text as: **BMI > 35 kg/m² + sleep‑disordered breathing (usually OSA) + daytime hypercapnia pCO₂ > 6 kPa**)

Operational screening/criteria mentioned for this subgroup:
- Respiratory features prompting further workup (e.g., ABG consideration):  
  - **SpO₂ < 95% on air**  
  - **FVC < 3 L** or **FEV1 < 1.5 L**  
  - **Wheeze at rest**  
  - **Serum bicarbonate > 27 mmol/L**  
  - **Arterial PCO₂ > 6 kPa** indicates respiratory failure/increased anaesthetic risk
- **STOP-BANG** is referenced as a screening tool for sleep-disordered breathing.
- **OS‑MRS (Obesity Surgery Mortality Risk Stratification score)** is referenced for identifying higher-risk patients (table referenced).

---

### 3) Obese patients undergoing sedation (non-GA “special circumstance” subgroup)
**Obese patients receiving procedural sedation** are treated as a specific subgroup:
- Pre‑operative evaluation for sedation should be **similar to general anaesthesia**.
- **Patients with sleep‑disordered breathing** are highlighted as particularly vulnerable: they “are likely to have airway obstruction with even minimal sedation.”
- The guideline states: **“Obese patients are not suitable for solo operator‑sedator procedures.”**

---

### 4) Obese patients requiring emergency surgery (special circumstance subgroup)
**Obese patients presenting for emergency surgery**:
- Should be managed by an **anaesthetist experienced in the care of the obese**, plus an **experienced surgeon** to reduce operative time and complications.
- The guideline notes obese patients may appear deceptively well; signs like **tachycardia, new abdominal pain, unexplained fever** may be the only indicators of serious pathology (e.g., intra‑abdominal sepsis).

---

### 5) Obese patients considered for day surgery (ambulatory subgroup)
**Obese patients undergoing day-case surgery**:
- Day surgery is acceptable if:
  - Management would **not be modified** by inpatient admission, and
  - Day-case treatment will **not alter peri‑operative risk**
- The guideline emphasizes not excluding patients **based on weight alone**.
- It references prevailing guidance: **automatic acceptance of patients with BMI < 40 kg/m²** (as stated in the provided text).
- It also points to additional considerations for **sleep‑disordered breathing** in ambulatory settings.

---

### 6) Obese obstetric patients (pregnant subgroup)
**Obese pregnant women/parturients** are explicitly addressed:
- Maternal obesity is described as a common obstetric risk factor with poorer maternal and fetal outcomes.
- Specific considerations include:
  - Increased likelihood of **induction** and **instrumental delivery**
  - Higher stillbirth risk noted for **BMI > 35 kg/m²** (stated as twice the national stillbirth rate in the provided text)
  - Anaesthetic challenges similar to non-obstetric obese patients, plus:
    - Vulnerability to **aortocaval compression**
    - **Early vascular access** recommended in labour for **BMI > 40 kg/m²**
  - Elevated risk of **VTE** (and also postpartum haemorrhage)

---

### 7) Obese patients in critical care / ICU (critical care subgroup)
**Morbidly obese patients in critical care** are discussed as a subgroup:
- Not necessarily higher mortality, but associated with:
  - Prolonged mechanical ventilation
  - Tracheostomy
  - Longer ICU stay
- Airway interventions should be performed by **appropriately skilled personnel**.
- Ventilation guidance uses **ideal body weight** for tidal volume calculation (5–7 ml/kg IBW).
- Emphasizes **VTE prophylaxis** and early rehabilitation/physiotherapy.

---

### 8) Morbidly obese patients requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR subgroup)
**Morbidly obese patients during resuscitation**:
- Recognized as having practical/technical challenges (defib pad placement, vascular access, airway).
- Notes that **standard defibrillation energies** and **standard drug doses (adrenaline/amiodarone)** remain unchanged.
- Recommends **intraosseous access** if IV access is difficult.

---

### 9) Patients with adjustable gastric bands in situ (bariatric device subgroup)
**Patients with laparoscopic adjustable gastric bands**:
- Considered at **increased aspiration risk** during general anaesthesia due to oesophageal dysmotility/dilatation.
- Recommendation in-text: **a tracheal tube is recommended in all patients who have a gastric band**.
- Acute symptoms (sudden dysphagia/upper abdominal pain) should be treated as possible **band slippage** (surgical emergency).

---

## Out-of-scope / exclusions (explicitly stated)
The provided text **does not include a formal “does not apply to…” exclusion list** (e.g., age cutoffs), but it does make these scope signals:
- Focus is on **peri‑operative anaesthesia and surgery** (including sedation, emergency, obstetrics, ICU interfaces).
- It notes that **obesity alone is not an indication** for higher-dependency postoperative care; escalation is driven by comorbidities/surgery/OSA/opioid needs.

If you upload the original PDF (or images of the “Scope/Target population” section), I can extract the exact wording verbatim; the text you provided appears to be the full body without a single labeled “Target population” header.",periop,target_population_extraction
PMC5029585.txt,"The 2015 **“Peri‑operative management of the obese surgical patient”** document is written as **general peri‑operative guidance for obese patients** rather than a protocol with a strict “do not use in X patients” list. In other words, it has **very few absolute patient-level exclusions**. Instead, it repeatedly signals situations where the guidance is **not sufficient on its own**, must be **modified**, or where **separate specialty guidance** should take precedence.

Below are the practical “exclusion / not-applicable / do-not-use-as-standalone” groups implied by the guideline.

---

## 1) Patients who are **not obese** (scope exclusion)
This guidance is intended for **patients who are obese** (WHO BMI categories). If a patient is not obese, standard peri‑operative guidance applies and this document is not the relevant primary guideline.

---

## 2) **Obstetric patients** (pregnancy) – use obstetric-specific guidance
The document has a dedicated “Special circumstances > Obstetrics” section and explicitly points to **CMACE** and the **Obstetric Anaesthetists’ Association** and **RCOG Green‑top** guidance for key decisions (e.g., VTE prophylaxis dosing in pregnancy/postpartum).

So, for **pregnant obese patients**, this guideline is **not a complete rulebook**; it should be used only as background alongside **obstetric anaesthesia/obstetric medicine** guidance.

---

## 3) Patients managed primarily in **critical care/ICU** – ICU guidance takes priority
It includes a “Special circumstances > Critical care” section, but ICU patients have distinct ventilation, airway, nutrition, thromboprophylaxis, and rehabilitation protocols. For a patient already in ICU (or whose main management decisions are ICU-based), this guideline is **supportive** rather than definitive; local ICU policies and critical care guidelines should lead.

---

## 4) Patients undergoing **procedural sedation where a “solo operator‑sedator” model is planned**
This is one of the clearest “cannot use” statements:

- **“Obese patients are not suitable for solo operator‑sedator procedures.”**

So if the planned care model is **one clinician both performing the procedure and providing sedation**, this guideline effectively says **do not proceed in that model** for obese patients; staffing must change (separate sedationist/anaesthetist).

(That’s not “the patient can’t use the guideline,” but it *is* a patient group for whom a common pathway is explicitly deemed inappropriate.)

---

## 5) Patients for whom the guideline’s **drug-delivery method is unreliable** (TCI propofol beyond model limits)
The guideline flags that certain **target-controlled infusion (TCI)** models become unreliable at high weights:

- Marsh/Schnider models become unreliable above roughly **140–150 kg** (and with BMI limits noted for Schnider).

So, in very high-weight patients, you **cannot apply the guideline’s implied “TCI as usual” approach** without modification; alternative dosing strategies and **depth of anaesthesia monitoring** are recommended. Practically, this is a “do not apply standard TCI assumptions” subgroup.

---

## 6) Patients with **adjustable gastric bands in situ** – aspiration risk changes the standard approach
The guideline states that these patients are at increased aspiration risk and recommends:

- **A tracheal tube is recommended in all patients who have a gastric band.**

So pathways that might otherwise be acceptable in some obese patients (e.g., supraglottic airway for short cases) are **effectively excluded** in this subgroup.

---

## 7) Patients being considered for **day surgery** who fail day-case suitability criteria
The guideline does not exclude obese patients from day surgery by weight alone, but it does set conditions. Day surgery is acceptable only if:

- management would **not be modified** by inpatient admission, **and**
- day-case treatment will **not alter peri‑operative risk**.

So obese patients who require modified management (e.g., anticipated need for extended monitoring, significant untreated OSA with opioid requirement, major surgery, poor functional capacity, etc.) are **not suitable for the day-surgery pathway** described.

---

## 8) Patients needing care beyond the capability of the facility (implicit organisational exclusion)
A recurring theme is that safe care requires:
- appropriate bariatric equipment (tables, beds, transfer devices),
- trained staff,
- ability to escalate to level‑2/3 care.

If a hospital cannot provide these, then the guideline cannot be safely implemented as intended; such patients may need **referral/transfer**. This is not a patient medical exclusion, but it is a real-world “cannot use this pathway here” criterion.

---

# Bottom line
There are **no broad medical exclusions** like “BMI > X cannot use this guideline.” Instead, the guideline is broadly applicable to obese surgical patients, but it **does not function as a standalone pathway** (or it **rules out certain common approaches**) in these groups:

- **Pregnancy/obstetrics** (use obstetric-specific guidance)
- **ICU/critical care–led management** (ICU guidance leads)
- **Sedation with solo operator‑sedator model** (explicitly not suitable)
- **Very high weight where TCI models are unreliable** (standard TCI assumptions not applicable)

PMC12433365.txt,"## TARGET POPULATION (extracted from the provided guideline text)

### Primary target population (who the statement applies to)
- **Oncology patients receiving immunotherapy** who develop **oral complications / oral immune-related adverse events (oral irAEs)**.
- The document is written as a **clinical practice statement for clinicians** and focuses on **management** (and some diagnostic considerations) for these oral toxicities in the setting of cancer immunotherapy.

**Key scope clarifiers included in the text**
- The CPS is **focused primarily on management of oral irAEs**, and **also covers diagnostic considerations** that are specific to each oral irAE.
- It is **not intended to be a comprehensive diagnostic tool** for:
  - **all oral complications in cancer patients**, nor
  - **oral diseases unrelated to the cancer therapy** that the patient may present.

---

## Target-population segments (by oral irAE / clinical presentation)
The guideline effectively defines “target populations” as **subgroups of immunotherapy-treated cancer patients** who present with specific oral toxicities:

### 1) Patients with immunotherapy-related **oral lichen planus (OLP) / oral lichenoid reaction (OLR)**
Applies to patients on immunotherapy who develop **OLP/OLR**, including **ulcerative/erosive** forms that can be difficult to manage.
- Notes a relevant subgroup: patients with **pre-existing oral mucosal disease** that may be **exacerbated** by immunotherapy; the guideline suggests **oral assessment prior to immunotherapy** to distinguish pre-existing disease vs new irAE.
- Also acknowledges that disease **may persist even after discontinuation** of immunotherapy and may become **chronic**.

### 2) Patients with suspected immunotherapy-related **oral pemphigoid-like (vesiculobullous) disease**
Applies when immunotherapy-treated patients present with features suggesting **oral vesiculobullous disease**.
- Includes patients with:
  - **oral-only involvement** (where biopsy/testing is emphasized), and/or
  - possible **multi-organ involvement** (prompting review of systems and referral to relevant specialists).
- Mentions a specific diagnostic-risk subgroup: if direct immunofluorescence suggests **lichen pemphigoides**, clinicians should evaluate for **recurrent or second primary malignancy** (because similar patterns can appear in PAMS).

### 3) Patients on immunotherapy with **erythema multiforme (EM) / Stevens–Johnson syndrome (SJS) / toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)** involving oral tissues
Applies to the rare but severe subgroup of immunotherapy-treated patients who develop **EM/SJS/TEN with oral involvement**.
- Emphasizes severity and potential **multi-organ involvement**, requiring oncology-team discussion and **multidisciplinary management**; immunotherapy may need to be **discontinued**.

### 4) Patients with immunotherapy-associated **oral mucositis / stomatitis** (non-specific erosions/ulcerations)
Applies to immunotherapy-treated patients with **non-specific oral mucosal erosion/ulceration** described as mucositis/stomatitis in prior literature.
- The guideline distinguishes this from chemo/radiotherapy mucositis by stating that for immunotherapy-associated cases, **topical steroids are the mainstay**.

### 5) Patients with immunotherapy-related **xerostomia / hyposalivation**
Applies to immunotherapy-treated patients with:
- **xerostomia** (subjective dry mouth) and/or
- **hyposalivation** (objectively reduced salivary flow).
Important subgroup note included: **Sjögren’s-like disease** in patients taking immune checkpoint inhibitors is described as **underdiagnosed** and potentially associated with **severe systemic manifestations**.

### 6) Patients with immunotherapy-related **dysgeusia** (taste disturbance)
Applies to immunotherapy-treated patients reporting **taste change**.
- The guideline highlights uncertainty about **duration** and **recovery time** after immunotherapy suspension.

### 7) Patients with immunotherapy-related **dysphagia**
Applies to immunotherapy-treated patients with **swallowing difficulty**, including cases where dysphagia is:
- directly related to swallowing-structure dysfunction, and/or
- **augmented by other oral irAEs** (OLP/OLR, stomatitis, xerostomia).

### 8) Patients on immunotherapy with **other rare oral toxicities**
Applies to immunotherapy-treated patients with less common reported oral irAEs, including:
- **sialadenitis**
- **medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw**
- **oral burning sensation**
- **oral pain**
- **facial palsy**
- and mentions **scleroderma** as an immunotherapy adverse effect with oral/dental implications.

### 9) Patients on immunotherapy needing **dental care / basic oral care (BOC)** before, during, or after treatment
Applies to immunotherapy-treated cancer patients in relation to:
- **routine oral hygiene and preventive care** (before/during/after cancer treatment),
- **dental evaluation prior to immunotherapy initiation** (especially if immunotherapy is first-line and dental clearance wasn’t done),
- and those receiving immunotherapy **concomitantly with chemotherapy or radiotherapy**.
Also includes subgroups where dental management may need modification, such as patients who develop:
- **neutropenia/pancytopenia** (rare but clinically significant),
- possible **adrenal insufficiency** (reported with ICIs),
- **new onset periodontitis** (reported more commonly with immunotherapy),
- **desquamative gingivitis** (which can impair brushing),
- **scleroderma** with limited mouth opening affecting dental access.

PMC12433365.txt,"This MASCC/ISOO Clinical Practice Statement (CPS) does not present “exclusion criteria” in the way a clinical trial would. Instead, it defines **scope limits**—i.e., situations and patient groups for whom the document is **not intended to be used as the primary/sole guidance**, or where its recommendations may not apply without specialist input.

Below are the practical “who cannot use this guideline (as written)” categories, based on the text you provided.

## 1) Patients whose oral problems are **not caused by immunotherapy (not oral irAEs)**
The CPS is **focused primarily on management of oral immune-related adverse events (irAEs)** from immunotherapy. It explicitly states it is **not**:
- “a comprehensive diagnostic tool for all oral complications in cancer patients,” and
- not for “oral diseases unrelated to the cancer therapy that the patient may present.”

So it should not be used as the main guideline when the oral condition is primarily due to:
- **Dental disease** (caries, pulpitis, abscess), trauma (sharp tooth/denture), etc., unless it is clearly complicating an irAE.
- **Infections** as the primary diagnosis (e.g., candidiasis, HSV) rather than an immune-mediated toxicity (though the CPS does advise ruling these out as contributors).
- **Radiation- or chemotherapy-induced mucositis** as the main driver (the CPS notes immunotherapy mucositis differs and is treated differently; it is not a general mucositis guideline).

## 2) Patients needing a **full diagnostic pathway** (the CPS is not a diagnostic manual)
If the key clinical need is *diagnosis* (rather than management after reasonable diagnostic workup), the CPS is not meant to substitute for:
- full oral medicine/oral pathology workup,
- biopsy protocols beyond the brief pointers it gives,
- comprehensive differential diagnosis of oral ulceration/vesiculobullous disease in cancer patients.

In other words, patients with unclear etiology, atypical lesions, or concern for malignancy/recurrence require diagnostic pathways outside this CPS.

## 3) Patients with **severe, systemic, or multi-organ immune toxicities** where oral-only guidance is insufficient
For certain high-severity entities (explicitly EM/SJS/TEN; and multi-organ pemphigoid), the CPS emphasizes that management must be led by oncology and relevant specialties and may require hospitalization and systemic therapy. In these patients, the CPS cannot be used as a stand-alone guide:
- **Stevens–Johnson syndrome / toxic epidermal necrolysis** (often requires inpatient/burn-unit–type care; immunotherapy may need discontinuation).
- **Erythema multiforme with significant systemic involvement**.
- **Pemphigoid-like disease with multi-organ involvement** (needs dermatology/ophthalmology/ENT/gynecology etc., plus systemic disease standards).

## 4) Patients whose “immunotherapy” is outside the CPS’s intended drug context (or where evidence is not established)
The CPS identifies immunotherapeutic agents by matching PubMed-identified agents with the **NCI FDA-approved immunotherapy list**. Practically, this means the guidance is least applicable (or should be used cautiously) for:
- patients on **non–FDA-approved immunotherapy regimens**, investigational agents, or novel combinations where oral toxicity patterns/management differ,
- settings where the oral condition is driven by **other concurrent therapies** and immunotherapy is not the main suspected cause (the CPS notes immunotherapy is often given with chemo/radiation).

## 5) Patients for whom the recommended treatments are **contraindicated or require individualized risk assessment**
The CPS recommends therapies (e.g., topical steroids, calcineurin inhibitors, systemic immunosuppression in severe cases) that may be inappropriate in some patients unless carefully individualized. Examples implied by the text:
- Patients where **topical calcineurin inhibitors** (tacrolimus/pimecrolimus) are not appropriate due to risk concerns or inability to limit use (it highlights the Black Box warning and advises avoiding continuous long-term use).
- Patients at high risk of complications from immunosuppression (e.g., active infection) where systemic steroids/immunomodulators would need specialist-led balancing—especially in EM/SJS/TEN contexts.

## 6) Pediatric patients (not explicitly covered)
Your excerpt does not mention children, pediatric dosing, or pediatric-specific considerations. Unless the full CPS states otherwise, this is a common practical limitation: **do not assume applicability to pediatric oncology** without pediatric specialist confirmation.

---

### Bottom line
Patients who “cannot use” this CPS (as their main guide) are those whose oral condition is **not an immunotherapy-related irAE**, those needing **comprehensive diagnosis**, and those with **severe/systemic mucocutaneous disease** requiring multidisciplinary/systemic management. For everyone else, it is intended as a **succinct management aid**, not a complete diagnostic or all-oral-complications guideline.

If you share the exact section of the CPS where you expect “exclusion criteria” (sometimes in the introduction/scope box or supplementary material), I can map the wording line-by-line to a formal exclusion list.",painmg,exclusion_criteria_extraction
PMC12611182.txt,"## TARGET POPULATION (extracted from the provided guideline text)

This document does not contain a single, explicit “Target Population” heading like your examples. Instead, the target population is described across the Abstract/Introduction and in the “Therapeutic Options” section. Below is the **verbatim/near-verbatim target-population text** that defines who the recommendations are about, followed by **segmented target populations** with significant details.

---

## 1) Overall target population (PSPS concept: who the recommendations are for)

**Extracted text (from Abstract/Introduction):**
- “In 2021, the term persistent spinal pain syndrome (PSPS) was introduced.”
- “PSPS type 2 (PSPS‐T2) replaced the unsatisfactory term failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS).”
- “PSPS type 1 (PSPS‐T1) is a clinical picture of signs and symptoms of FBSS but without prior surgery.”
- “PSPS applies to any spinal level.”
- “The most common manifestation of PSPS is chronic low back pain, with or without lower limb pain.”
- “The current manuscript characterizes subpopulations of chronic secondary pain of spinal origin within the definition of PSPS (i.e., excluding certain specific conditions such as ankylosing spondylitis).”

**What this means as a target population statement (faithful to the text):**  
Patients with **persistent spinal pain of spinal origin** (chronic secondary pain of spinal origin) at **any spinal level**, most commonly **chronic low back pain ± lower limb pain**, classified as **PSPS type 1 (no prior pain-relieving spine surgery)** or **PSPS type 2 (history of pain-relieving spine surgery that failed to relieve pain or increased/caused it)**. The paper explicitly notes it is **excluding certain specific conditions such as ankylosing spondylitis**.

---

## 2) Target population segment A: PSPS Type 1 (PSPS‑T1)

**Extracted text (definitions + clinical description):**
- “PSPS type 1 (PSPS‐T1) is a clinical picture of signs and symptoms of FBSS but without prior surgery.”
- “Patients with PSPS‐T1, that is, chronic axial pain and/or limb symptoms of spinal origin who have not undergone spinal surgery…”

**Additional extracted details about typical candidacy context (who these patients are in practice):**
- PSPS‑T1 patients “may be considered ineligible for spinal surgery for various reasons, including:
  - patient does not give consent for surgical procedure following unbiased information;
  - significant co‐morbidity that will adversely affect the risk/benefit of the procedure;
  - better outcomes and safety can be achieved with nonsurgical management;
  - evidence of chronic neuropathy with neuropathic pain;
  - potentially remediable pathology is nonconcordant with symptoms.”

**Segment summary (PSPS‑T1 target population):**  
Patients with **chronic axial spinal pain and/or limb symptoms of spinal origin** who **have not had prior spinal surgery intended to relieve pain**. The guideline particularly discusses PSPS‑T1 in the context of patients who are **not surgical candidates** or **do not proceed with surgery** for reasons such as comorbidity, lack of consent, nonconcordant imaging/pathology, or dominance of neuropathic mechanisms.

---

## 3) Target population segment B: PSPS Type 2 (PSPS‑T2)

**Extracted text (definitions + relationship to FBSS/ICD terminology):**
- “PSPS type 2 (PSPS‐T2) … where there was a history of such surgery, and it had failed to relieve the pain or had increased or caused it.”
- “Type 2 includes, but does not equate to, the ICD‐11 diagnosis chronic pain after spinal surgery (CPSS). The latter term is specific for pain caused by, or probably caused by, surgery…”
- “PSPS‐T2 includes neuropathic, nociplastic, and nociceptive pain. The relative dominance of each category or mechanism may determine the success of therapy outcomes.”
- “PSPS‐T2 is the commonest indication for SCS [spinal cord stimulation].”
- “Further surgery for patients with PSPS‐T2 may be considered inappropriate for the same reasons [as PSPS‑T1].”

**Segment summary (PSPS‑T2 target population):**  
Patients with persistent spinal pain of spinal origin who **previously underwent spinal surgery intended to relieve pain**, but the surgery **failed to relieve pain** or **worsened/caused pain**. This group may include (but is not identical to) ICD‑11 **chronic pain after spinal surgery (CPSS)**. The guideline emphasizes that PSPS‑T2 can involve **neuropathic, nociplastic, nociceptive, or mixed** mechanisms, and that mechanism dominance influences treatment selection (including neuromodulation such as SCS).

---

## 4) Target population segment C: “Patients presenting with chronic low back pain” (broader clinical entry point)

**Extracted text (clinical presentation framing):**
- “For patients presenting with chronic low back pain, there are few absolute indications for spinal surgery.”
- “The most common manifestation of PSPS is chronic low back pain, with or without lower limb pain.”
- “Surgeons are frequently faced with patients with radicular or referred spinal pain of spinal origin where there is little concordance with the anatomical findings.”

**Segment summary (presentation-based target population):**  
Patients presenting clinically with **chronic low back pain** (often with **radicular/referred pain** and sometimes **lower limb pain**) where symptoms may be **nonconcordant with anatomical findings**, and where pain mechanisms may be **neuropathic and/or nociplastic** (often mixed).

---

## 5) Explicit exclusions / out-of-scope (as stated)

**Extracted text:**
- The manuscript characterizes PSPS subpopulations “**excluding certain specific conditions such as ankylosing spondylitis**.”

---

## Consolidated “TARGET POPULATION” (ready-to-use, derived strictly from the extracted text)

**TARGET POPULATION:**  
Individuals with **persistent spinal pain syndrome (PSPS)**—i.e., **chronic secondary pain of spinal origin** affecting **any spinal level**, most commonly **chronic low back pain with or without lower limb pain**—including:
- **PSPS Type 1 (PSPS‑T1):** chronic axial pain and/or limb symptoms of spinal origin **without prior spinal surgery intended to relieve pain**; and  
- **PSPS Type 2 (PSPS‑T2):** persistent pain in patients with a **history of spinal surgery intended to relieve pain** where surgery **failed to relieve pain or increased/caused it** (includes but is not equivalent to ICD‑11 **chronic pain after spinal surgery**).  
The manuscript notes it is **excluding certain specific conditions such as ankylosing spondylitis**.

If you want, I can also extract and format the **population descriptors implied by the PAMC classification** (region/location categories, mechanism categories, and certainty levels) as “subpopulations” for study eligibility language.",painmg,target_population_extraction
PMC12611182.txt,"This PSPS guideline is meant for **chronic spinal pain of spinal origin** (with or without limb pain) that fits **PSPS type 1** (no prior pain-relieving spine surgery) or **PSPS type 2** (pain persists/worsens after such surgery). Patients fall *outside* the guideline when their pain is **not “persistent spinal pain syndrome” as defined**, or when another diagnosis better explains the symptoms.

## 1) Conditions explicitly excluded (named in the text)
- **Ankylosing spondylitis / axial spondyloarthritis** (and, by extension, other primary inflammatory spondyloarthritides where inflammation is the main driver rather than degenerative/mechanism-based PSPS).

## 2) Pain that is not “of spinal origin” (doesn’t meet PSPS concept)
These patients should not be classified/managed under this PSPS framework because the spine is not the primary source:
- **Non-spinal primary pain disorders** where the spine findings are incidental (e.g., primary hip pathology, peripheral joint disease, visceral sources, vascular claudication, peripheral neuropathy unrelated to the spine).
- **Widespread pain syndromes not primarily attributable to spinal pathology** (the paper discusses nociplastic mechanisms, but PSPS still requires a *spinal origin*; if the best explanation is a generalized non-spinal condition, PSPS is not the right label).

## 3) Patients with “absolute indications” for urgent/definitive spine surgery (not a PSPS-treatment pathway issue)
The manuscript notes that for chronic low back pain there are few absolute surgical indications, but one is:
- **Progressive and/or potentially disabling neurological deficit due to a compressing lesion**  
  These patients should be routed to urgent surgical evaluation rather than treated within a PSPS mechanism-based chronic pain pathway.

## 4) Acute/subacute presentations (not “persistent”)
PSPS is a **persistent/chronic** syndrome. Patients whose pain is not persistent (e.g., early/acute radiculopathy) are generally outside scope. The paper illustrates this with evidence in **<1-year radiculopathy** populations (microdiscectomy vs injections), implying that early cases are not the PSPS target group.

## 5) Situations where the PSPS framework may not be applicable because the “spinal pain syndrome” construct is not the main problem
Even if a patient has back/neck pain, the guideline is not intended to be the primary framework when:
- The dominant issue is a **clearly remediable structural lesion** with strong symptom concordance and a standard pathway (i.e., not “persistent spinal pain syndrome” management but routine surgical/non-surgical care).
- The presentation is better explained by a **different primary diagnosis** (infection, malignancy, fracture, etc.). The excerpt you provided doesn’t list these “red flag” diagnoses explicitly, but clinically they would not be managed under a PSPS chronic pain classification model.

## Important clarification: “Ineligible for surgery” is not the same as “excluded from PSPS”
The paper lists reasons some **PSPS-T1** (and similarly PSPS‑T2) patients may be **ineligible for further spine surgery**, such as:
- no consent,
- significant comorbidity affecting risk/benefit,
- better outcomes with non-surgical management,
- evidence of chronic neuropathy/neuropathic pain,
- nonconcordance between remediable pathology and symptoms.

These are **not exclusion criteria from the PSPS guideline**—they are reasons the patient may be steered away from (revision) surgery and toward other PSPS-appropriate options (e.g., neuromodulation, rehab, behavioral, pharmacologic strategies).

If you tell me which part of the guideline you’re implementing (diagnostic classification/PAMC vs treatment selection such as SCS), I can restate the exclusions in a checklist tailored to that use.",painmg,exclusion_criteria_extraction
PMC11711572.txt,"## TARGET POPULATION (as stated/implied in the guideline)

### 1) Primary target population: **Hospitalized / inpatient candidates with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), especially moderate–to–severe flares**
**Extracted target-population text (compiled from the guideline’s scope statements):**
- The review is “**aimed at hospitalists and consulting dermatologists considering hospital admission for patients experiencing severe HS flares**.”
- It “**serves as a resource for hospitalists, consulting dermatologists, other healthcare providers, and allied health professionals who may encounter HS patients in the inpatient setting**.”
- It focuses on “**patient selection for admission**” and “**management of HS in the inpatient setting**.”
- “**Patients with moderate to severe HS often seek care in the emergency department and may require hospitalization**…”
- “For **moderate to severe cases**, several factors can influence admission decisions… **Admission may be warranted for patients who have not responded to outpatient management, experience intractable pain, have difficulty accessing specialist care, or suffer from acute exacerbations**.”

**Significant details that define this population (from the admission section):**
- **Disease severity focus:** moderate-to-severe HS; “severe HS flares”; “advanced or complicated cases.”
- **Care setting:** ED-to-inpatient transition; hospitalized patients; inpatient management pathways.
- **Typical anatomic distribution described:** axilla, inframammary folds/region, buttocks, inner thighs, anogenital regions.
- **Common severe features referenced:** abscesses, tunneling, scarring; extensive lesions; possible fistulas/hidden abscesses (when considering imaging).
- **Admission drivers / selection factors:**
  - failure of outpatient management
  - **intractable pain**
  - difficulty accessing specialist care / follow-up limitations
  - acute exacerbations
  - considerations of self-care capacity, ADLs, and support systems
  - availability of medical therapies and follow-up access

---

### 2) Special inpatient subpopulation: **Moderate–to–severe HS patients needing “rescue therapy” (IV therapy bridge)**
**Extracted/anchored text:**
- “A key advantage of hospital admission is the ability to initiate aggressive treatment for HS with **IV rescue therapy**.”
- “A promising approach is a **6-week regimen of ertapenem**, which has shown clinical remission… for patients with **advanced HS**.”
- “**IV steroids**… can be administered… particularly after recent ertapenem courses.”

**Who this applies to (as described):**
- Patients with **advanced HS** and/or severe flares where inpatient initiation of IV therapy is appropriate.
- Patients for whom inpatient care is used as a **bridge to long-term maintenance**.

---

### 3) Special inpatient subpopulation: **HS patients being evaluated for biologic therapy (severe or refractory disease)**
**Extracted/anchored text:**
- “Patients admitted with HS should be **evaluated for biologic therapy**, especially those who **have not responded to standard treatments** or have **severe disease impacting their quality of life**.”
- Notes FDA-approved options (adalimumab, secukinumab, bimekizumab) and off-label infliximab; inpatient stay used to complete screening labs (CBC, CMP, LFTs, hepatitis, latent TB).

**Who this applies to (as described):**
- Inpatients with HS who are **refractory to standard therapy** and/or have **severe, QoL-limiting disease**, where inpatient workup/coordination can accelerate outpatient initiation.

---

### 4) Special populations explicitly mentioned: **Pregnant patients and pediatric patients with HS (limited evidence)**
**Extracted/anchored text:**
- “Inpatient management of HS in **pregnant and pediatric patients** has not been extensively studied.”
- “**Tetracyclines are contraindicated** in both pregnant patients and children under nine years old…”

**Who this applies to (as described):**
- Pregnant patients with HS (often stable or worsening during pregnancy; postpartum flares noted).
- Pediatric patients with HS, particularly medication-safety constraints (e.g., tetracyclines avoided under age 9).

---

## One-paragraph segmented summary (by target population)

1) **Inpatient candidates with moderate–to–severe HS flares:** The guideline targets clinicians managing HS in the hospital, especially when patients present via the ED with severe flares, significant pain, functional impairment, poor outpatient response, or barriers to follow-up/support—situations where admission enables coordinated multidisciplinary care.

2) **Advanced HS needing IV “rescue therapy”:** A subset of admitted patients with advanced/severe disease may receive inpatient-initiated IV regimens (notably ertapenem) and sometimes IV steroids as short-term rescue/bridge strategies.

3) **Severe/refractory HS needing biologic evaluation:** Another subset includes inpatients whose disease is severe or unresponsive to standard treatments and who should be assessed and worked up (TB/hepatitis labs, etc.) to expedite biologic therapy initiation after discharge.

4) **Pregnant and pediatric HS inpatients:** These groups are acknowledged but with limited inpatient evidence; the guideline flags pregnancy course considerations and key medication contraindications (e.g., tetracyclines in pregnancy and in children <9).",painmg,target_population_extraction
PMC11711572.txt,"This article is a **clinical review/guide**, not a validated protocol, so it does **not** give a single, explicit “exclusion criteria” list. In practice, the “patients who cannot use this guideline” fall into two buckets:

1) **Patients for whom the guide’s core assumption is wrong (it’s not HS or it’s not an HS flare)**  
2) **Patients who may have HS but for whom key recommended inpatient therapies are contraindicated or require major modification**

Below is a detailed, practical exclusion/“do not apply as-written” list based on what the guide says and standard inpatient safety constraints.

---

## 1) Patients who should not be managed under an HS inpatient pathway because the diagnosis is uncertain or another condition is more urgent

### A. Not HS / alternative diagnosis more likely
Do not apply an HS-specific inpatient algorithm if lesions are better explained by:
- **Necrotizing soft tissue infection** (rapid progression, severe pain out of proportion, crepitus, systemic toxicity)
- **Primary bacterial abscesses/furunculosis** without HS features (no chronicity, no typical distribution, no tunnels/scarring)
- **Perianal Crohn’s disease with fistulas** as the primary driver (HS can coexist, but Crohn’s-directed workup/treatment may be primary)
- **Pilonidal disease** (midline natal cleft disease) without other HS sites
- **Sexually transmitted infections** or other genital ulcerative diseases mimicking HS
- **Hidradenitis-like lesions from other causes** (e.g., acne conglobata, folliculitis variants) where HS criteria aren’t met

**Why this matters:** The guide emphasizes HS is inflammatory and that sepsis is “not typically caused by HS lesions.” If the patient actually has a primary infection or necrotizing process, HS-style management (e.g., “rescue” antibiotics chosen for HS, steroids, delayed surgical urgency) could be harmful.

### B. Systemic infection/sepsis or deep complication is suspected
If the patient meets sepsis criteria or has concerning features (fever, hypotension, rapidly spreading cellulitis, immunosuppression with systemic signs), the HS guide is **not sufficient as a primary framework**—they need a **sepsis/soft tissue infection pathway first**, with HS care as secondary.

---

## 2) Patients who may have HS but cannot use major parts of the guideline “as written” due to contraindications

The guide’s inpatient “value-add” centers on: **IV rescue therapy (ertapenem ± IV steroids), antibiotics regimens, and evaluation/bridging to biologics**, plus pain control and wound care. The following groups cannot safely follow those components without modification.

### A. Pregnancy (and often breastfeeding): several recommended drugs are contraindicated or limited
The guide explicitly notes inpatient HS management in pregnancy is not well studied and highlights key contraindications:
- **Tetracyclines are contraindicated** in pregnancy (and in young children; see below).
- Many HS systemic options require risk/benefit review in pregnancy (e.g., **rifampin-based regimens**, **systemic steroids**, and **biologics** depending on agent and trimester).
So pregnant patients are **not excluded from inpatient care**, but they are **excluded from using the medication portions of this guide without obstetrics/MFM input and pregnancy-safe substitutions**.

### B. Pediatric patients (especially < 9 years): key first-line oral options may be unusable
The guide states:
- **Tetracyclines are contraindicated in children under 9** (teeth/bone effects).
Also, pediatric dosing/safety for biologics and prolonged IV antibiotics requires pediatric dermatology/infectious disease oversight. So the guide is **not directly generalizable** to many pediatric inpatients.

### C. Patients with contraindications to “rescue therapy” (IV ertapenem and/or systemic steroids)

**IV ertapenem (6-week rescue regimen) may be inappropriate in:**
- **Severe beta-lactam allergy** (carbapenem cross-reactivity is low but not zero; severe immediate hypersensitivity is a major concern)
- **History of severe C. difficile infection** or very high risk for it (prolonged broad-spectrum therapy)
- **Patients where prolonged IV therapy is unsafe or infeasible** (no safe line access, high line infection risk, inability to arrange OPAT/home infusion, unsafe home environment)
- **Significant drug–drug interaction or antimicrobial stewardship constraints** (institutional restrictions)

**Systemic/IV steroids may be inappropriate in:**
- **Uncontrolled diabetes**
- **Active serious infection** (or strong suspicion of one)
- **Severe psychiatric history where steroids are high risk (e.g., steroid psychosis history)**
- **GI bleeding risk, severe osteoporosis, etc.** (relative contraindications)

If the “rescue therapy” pillar can’t be used, the guide’s inpatient pathway may not fit the patient’s situation.

### D. Patients who cannot receive biologic therapy (or cannot be evaluated/started safely)
The guide recommends inpatient evaluation for biologics and notes required screening (CBC/CMP/LFTs, hepatitis, TB). Patients who cannot use that pathway “as written” include those with:
- **Untreated latent or active TB**
- **Active hepatitis B** (or high-risk serologies without a prophylaxis plan)
- **Active serious infection**
- **Severe uncontrolled immunosuppression or malignancy scenarios** where biologics are contraindicated or require specialist clearance
- **Inability to obtain follow-up/coverage for biologics** (not a medical contraindication, but functionally prevents the guideline’s intended transition to maintenance therapy)

### E. Patients with contraindications to specific antibiotic regimens mentioned
The guide references common HS regimens (tetracyclines; clindamycin/rifampin; moxifloxacin/metronidazole/rifampin). Patients who cannot use these “as written” include those with:
- **Significant liver disease** (rifampin, clindamycin, metronidazole considerations)
- **QT prolongation or high arrhythmia risk** (moxifloxacin)
- **Major drug interactions** (rifampin is a strong inducer affecting many drugs: anticoagulants, antiretrovirals, transplant meds, etc.)
- **History of severe antibiotic-associated colitis** (clindamycin risk)
- **Myasthenia gravis** (fluoroquinolones can worsen)

---

## 3) Patients for whom inpatient admission guidance is not applicable (outpatient is more appropriate)
The review is specifically for **moderate–severe flares where admission is being considered**. So it is not meant for:
- **Mild HS** manageable with topical therapy and outpatient oral agents
- **Stable chronic HS without an acute issue** (no uncontrolled pain, no functional decline, no need for inpatient coordination)

---

## Bottom line
There isn’t a formal “exclusion criteria” section, but the guideline should **not be used as the primary management framework** for:
1) **Patients who may not actually have HS or who have a surgical/emergent infection process** (nec fasc, sepsis, deep abscess requiring urgent source control).  
2) **Pregnant patients, young children, and patients with major contraindications** to the guide’s key therapies (tetracyclines, prolonged IV ertapenem, systemic steroids, biologics, rifampin/fluoroquinolone-based regimens) unless care is substantially modified with appropriate specialty input.

If you tell me the patient’s age, pregnancy status, comorbidities (TB/hepatitis risk, immunosuppression, diabetes), and what therapy is being considered (ertapenem, steroids, biologic), I can translate this into a concrete “eligible vs not eligible” checklist for that scenario.",painmg,exclusion_criteria_extraction

**Significant details explicitly stated around target population / intended setting & users:**
- **Population:** Adults (the guideline repeatedly operationalizes adults as **≥18 years** in its inclusion criteria for evidence).
- **Condition context:** People **living with spinal cord injury (SCI)**, specifically in relation to **neuropathic pain (NP) after SCI**.
- **Care phase / setting included:** From **subacute inpatient rehabilitation** through **outpatient and community** living.
- **Care phase / setting excluded:** **Acute care immediately after the initial injury**.
- **Geographic/health-system context:** “relevant for **inpatient, outpatient and community SCI rehabilitation settings in Canada**.”
- **Intended users (not the population, but part of scope):** “clinicians who care for those with SCI”; also notes researchers and health policy experts will find it valuable.

---

## TARGET POPULATION (Evidence inclusion/exclusion criteria — additional population specifications)

While not labeled “target population,” the guideline’s study inclusion criteria further specify who the recommendations are built from (useful for “significant details”):

**Included study populations (key criteria):**
- Studies where **≥50%** of participants had **traumatic or non-traumatic SCI**
- Participants had **neuropathic pain or mixed pain**
- **Human adults (≥18 years)** with SCI and neuropathic or mixed pain
- Conducted in **rehabilitation, outpatient, or community** settings
- Assessed **pain intensity** outcomes

**Excluded study populations/settings (relevant boundaries):**
- **Musculoskeletal pain only**
- **Acute setting**
- Certain publication types (reviews, case reports, protocols, qualitative studies)

---

## Segmentation by “target population” groups (as implied by the guideline)

The guideline largely has **one overarching target population**, but it also implies **subgroups** where applicability differs:

### 1) Core target population (primary)
- **Adults (≥18) with SCI** experiencing **neuropathic pain**, managed in **subacute rehab → community** settings  
- **Not** in immediate post-injury **acute care**

### 2) SCI subtype (included)
- **Traumatic and non-traumatic SCI** (explicitly included in evidence base)

### 3) Pain presentation (included)
- **Neuropathic pain** and **mixed pain** presentations (explicitly included in evidence base)  
- **Musculoskeletal-only pain** is outside the evidence scope used.

### 4) Completeness of injury (important subgroup where recommendations differ)
- The guideline explicitly notes at least one treatment where evidence applies only to a subgroup:  
  - **Lamotrigine:** evidence of efficacy demonstrated **only in patients with an incomplete SCI**; recommended only in that subpopulation.

If you upload the PDF (or images) of the guideline pages, I can also extract the **exact “Target population” heading text** if it appears elsewhere (some guidelines repeat it in executive summaries, algorithms, or appendices).",painmg,target_population_extraction
PMC9209331.txt,"The CanPainSCI 2021 guideline is **not meant to be applied to everyone with pain after SCI**. Its scope is fairly specific: **adults with spinal cord injury (traumatic or non‑traumatic) who have neuropathic pain (or mixed pain with a neuropathic component) in rehabilitation/outpatient/community settings**. Patients outside that scope are effectively “excluded” (i.e., the guideline is not intended for them).

Below are the practical exclusion criteria—**who cannot/should not use this guideline as their primary guide**—based on the document’s stated scope and the inclusion/exclusion rules used to build the evidence base.

---

## 1) Acute-care / immediately post-injury patients
**Excluded:** People with SCI who are **still in the acute care setting immediately after the initial injury**.

- The guideline is intended for the **subacute inpatient rehabilitation phase onward**, including outpatient and community living.
- So if someone is in **ICU/acute trauma/neurosurgical acute ward** right after injury, these recommendations are **not designed** for that context (different priorities, medical instability, evolving neurologic status, perioperative issues, etc.).

---

## 2) Children and adolescents
**Excluded:** **Anyone under 18 years old.**

- The guideline’s target population is **adults** with SCI.
- Pediatric SCI neuropathic pain management may differ in diagnosis tools, dosing, safety, and evidence base.

---

## 3) People without neuropathic pain (NP)
**Excluded:** People whose pain is **not neuropathic**, especially:

### A) Musculoskeletal/nociceptive pain only
- The evidence review explicitly excluded studies with **musculoskeletal pain only**.
- Therefore, if a patient’s pain is purely nociceptive (e.g., shoulder overuse pain, mechanical low back pain) **without a neuropathic component**, this guideline is **not applicable**.

### B) Other non-neuropathic pain syndromes as the primary problem
- If the main issue is **visceral pain**, **inflammatory pain**, **mechanical pain**, etc., and not NP, this guideline is not the right tool.

*(Note: the guideline does include “mixed pain” populations in the evidence base, but the intent is still management of the **neuropathic** component after SCI.)*

---

## 4) People without spinal cord injury (SCI)
**Excluded:** Patients with neuropathic pain from other causes (even if “central neuropathic pain”), such as:
- stroke-related central pain
- multiple sclerosis
- peripheral neuropathies (diabetic neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia)
- radiculopathy without SCI

The recommendations are specifically framed for **SCI-related neuropathic pain** and SCI rehabilitation realities (bowel/bladder, spasticity, autonomic dysreflexia risk, functional goals, etc.).

---

## 5) Settings outside rehabilitation/outpatient/community (as the intended context)
Even if the patient is an adult with SCI and NP, the guideline is **not intended** to be used as-is in:
- **acute inpatient medical/surgical** settings immediately post-injury (covered above)
- contexts where the care model is fundamentally different from rehab/outpatient/community SCI management

---

## Important clarification: “Exclusion” is about guideline scope, not medication contraindications
The guideline itself does **not** provide a single list like “do not use in pregnancy, renal failure, etc.” because it is a **rehabilitation CPG**, not a drug label. So:

- A patient may be **within scope** (adult, SCI, NP, rehab/community) but still **unable to use specific treatments** due to individual contraindications (e.g., renal impairment limiting gabapentinoids, anticholinergic burden limiting amitriptyline, substance use risk limiting opioids, psychiatric risk with cannabinoids, etc.).  
- Those are **treatment-specific exclusions**, handled via standard prescribing precautions and shared decision-making—not blanket guideline exclusion.

---

### If you tell me the patient’s age, time since injury, care setting (acute vs rehab vs community), and pain type (neuropathic vs musculoskeletal vs mixed), I can map them clearly to “in scope” vs “out of scope” for this guideline.",painmg,exclusion_criteria_extraction
PMC12681192.txt,"## TARGET POPULATION (extracted from the guideline text)

This guideline does **not** contain a single, explicit “Target Population” section/heading in the way your melanoma/PSA/breast cancer examples do. However, the **target population is clearly described throughout** the document (especially in the Abstract, Conclusions, Epidemiology Q1, and the patient-selection sections for RFA and fusion). Below is the **best faithful extraction** of the guideline’s target-population language, organized into distinct target populations the guideline repeatedly addresses.

---

## 1) People with **chronic low back pain (LBP)** where SIJ complex pain is suspected

**Extracted/near-verbatim population language from the guideline**
- “**SIJ complex pain remains an underappreciated source of chronic low back pain, affecting between 15% and 30% of patients with axial pain predominantly below L5.**”
- “**SIJ complex pain is commonly estimated to affect approximately 15%–30% of individuals with chronic, non-radicular LBP predominantly below L5.**”
- “**The first consideration** … is to appropriately diagnose SIJ complex dysfunction as the source of LBP. **Approximately 15%–30% of mechanical LBP predominantly below L5 can be attributed to SIJ dysfunction.**”

**Significant details / scope implied by the text**
- Focus is on **chronic** LBP and **axial** pain patterns, especially **below L5**.
- Emphasis is on **non-radicular** LBP when estimating prevalence, but the guideline also discusses SIJ pain **with concomitant pathology** (see next population).
- The guideline repeatedly frames SIJ pain as a **subset of chronic LBP**, and positions **interventional diagnosis (injections/blocks)** as the reference standard given limitations of history/physical/imaging.

---

## 2) People with LBP plus **concomitant lumbar pathology** (including radicular pain/disc herniation) where SIJ dysfunction may coexist

**Extracted/near-verbatim population language**
- “**The prevalence of SIJ pain in the presence of concomitant pathology is less well-defined.**”
- “In a 2020 study of individuals with **lumbar disc herniations**, the prevalence of **SIJ dysfunction** was estimated to be **33%** … suggesting that **SIJ pain may be present in one-third of individuals with lumbar radicular pain and MRI findings consistent with disc herniation.**”

**Significant details**
- This is not the “core” prevalence population (non-radicular axial LBP), but the guideline explicitly includes discussion of **mixed presentations** where SIJ pain may be **co-present** with disc disease/radicular symptoms.

---

## 3) People with SIJ complex pain **after lumbar or lumbosacral fusion surgery** (post-fusion/adjacent segment SIJ pain)

**Extracted/near-verbatim population language**
- “**The prevalence of SIJ complex pain is suspected to be higher in patients with a prior history of lumbar or lumbosacral spinal fusion** with estimated prevalence rates between **33% and 59%**…”
- “Chronic LBP following lumbar or lumbosacral spinal fusion surgery can be related to adjacent segment stress… superimposed or missed SIJ-mediated pain prior to lumbar fusion, and/or violation of ligaments or synovial lining…”

**Significant details**
- The guideline treats post-fusion patients as a **notable subgroup** with **higher suspected prevalence** and specific biomechanical rationale (adjacent segment loading, increased SIJ motion, possible iatrogenic ligament/synovial violation).

---

## 4) People with **inflammatory sacroiliitis / inflammatory arthritis** involving the SIJ (distinct IA SIJ disease variant)

**Extracted/near-verbatim population language**
- “**Inflammatory arthritis represents a distinct variant of IA SIJ disease**, being especially common in **ankylosing spondyloarthropathy** and to a lesser degree **rheumatoid arthritis**.”
- Imaging section: “Imaging is the reference standard for identifying **sacroiliitis** … most commonly occurring in the context of **systemic rheumatologic disorders**…”

**Significant details**
- The guideline distinguishes inflammatory sacroiliitis from degenerative/mechanical SIJ pain (e.g., morning stiffness >30 min, improvement with activity, nocturnal pain, uveitis/enthesitis, onset <40).
- This subgroup appears mainly in the **diagnosis/imaging** and **injection evidence** discussions (including trials in spondyloarthropathy).

---

## 5) Candidates for **sacral lateral branch radiofrequency ablation (SLBRFA)** for posterior/extra-articular SIJ complex pain

**Extracted/near-verbatim population language**
- “There is **strong evidence for sacral lateral branch RFA** to provide relief for at least **6 months** in individuals with **extra-articular pathology**…”
- “SLBRFA … disrupt nociceptive signals from the **EA structures and posterior bony cortex** of the posterior SIJ complex…”
- “The cutoff to designate diagnostic or prognostic blocks as positive is most commonly set at **50%**…”
- “**≥50% pain relief** should be considered the cutoff for considering a diagnostic or prognostic SIJ injection to be ‘positive’ with regard to selecting patients for SLBRFA…”

**Significant details**
- The guideline’s RFA pathway is aimed at **posterior sacral network / dorsal ligament-related (extra-articular) pain generators**, not purely ventral/anterior intra-articular pathology.
- Selection is framed around:
  - clinical suspicion of SIJ complex pain,
  - failure of conservative options (discussed broadly),
  - and **prognostic blocks** (with a commonly used **≥50%** relief threshold).

---

## 6) Candidates for **sacroiliac joint fusion surgery** (refractory SIJ complex pain; selection criteria emphasized)

**Extracted/near-verbatim population language (selection criteria)**
From the SIJ fusion selection summary:
- “Appropriate patient selection for SIJ fusion should include a combination of the following…”
  - “**At least 6 months of non-radicular pain below L5**, consistent with SIJ pain.”
  - “Failure of at least **12 weeks of conservative care**… and other nonsurgical interventions.”
  - “Physical exam indicating a positive response on at least **3 out of 6 SIJ provocation tests**.”
  - “History and radiologic studies that rule out other possible sources of pain…”
  - “Positive responses to **low-volume, dual prognostic IA SIJ injections (without corticosteroid)**, under fluoroscopic or CT guidance.”
- ISASS-related statement: patients considered for fusion “should have had at least **6 months of SIJ complex pain** which impacts quality of life, and have failed nonsurgical treatments…”

**Significant details**
- Fusion is positioned for **carefully selected**, **refractory** patients after conservative and less invasive options.
- The guideline highlights uncertainty about the exact prognostic block threshold for fusion (notes mixed evidence; recommends **higher than 50%** plus functional improvement, and discusses dissents advocating ≥75% on dual blocks).

---

### If you want this in your exact template
If you tell me whether you want **one consolidated “TARGET POPULATION” paragraph** (broad scope) or **separate target-population blocks per intervention** (diagnosis/injections/RFA/fusion), I can rewrite the above into your preferred standardized format while staying faithful to the guideline’s wording.",painmg,target_population_extraction
PMC12681192.txt,"These consensus guidelines are **not a “one-size-fits-all” pathway for every person with low back/buttock pain**. They are intended for patients in whom the clinician is evaluating and treating **suspected sacroiliac joint (SIJ) complex pain** (intra‑articular SIJ pain and/or posterior extra‑articular ligamentous/posterior sacral network pain). Patients fall *outside* the guideline (or should not be managed *using this SIJ-specific algorithm*) in the following situations.

## 1) Pain pattern or diagnosis is not consistent with SIJ complex pain
The guideline is framed around **mechanical, predominantly non‑radicular pain below L5**. It is *not* meant to be applied as the primary guideline when the dominant presentation suggests another pain generator, including:

- **Lumbar radiculopathy / nerve root pain** (leg-dominant pain in a dermatomal pattern, neurologic deficits, clear radicular signs).
- **Primary hip pathology** (e.g., intra‑articular hip disease as the main driver).
- **Generalized pain disorders / widespread pain phenotypes** where SIJ interventions are unlikely to be the main solution (the guideline explicitly notes ruling out “generalized pain disorders” when selecting for fusion).
- **Other clearly established spinal sources** (discogenic pain, facetogenic pain, spinal stenosis) when those are the more plausible primary generator.

In short: if the clinical picture is not “SIJ-complex-like,” these recommendations shouldn’t be used to justify SIJ injections/RFA/fusion as the next step.

## 2) “Red flag” or destructive etiologies (must be ruled out first)
The document repeatedly emphasizes imaging/labs are mainly useful to **rule out** serious causes. Patients whose symptoms/signs suggest these conditions should not be routed through the routine SIJ intervention pathway until appropriately evaluated/treated:

- **Infection** (e.g., septic sacroiliitis, osteomyelitis).
- **Tumor / malignancy** involving the pelvis/sacrum.
- **Inflammatory/autoimmune sacroiliitis** (e.g., axial spondyloarthritis) as the primary problem—these patients often require rheumatologic disease-directed therapy; SIJ injections may be used selectively, but the “mechanical SIJ complex” pathway is not the main guideline.
- **Fracture/major structural instability** or other destructive lesions.

## 3) Patients who cannot safely undergo the *required diagnostic/prognostic steps*
A large part of the guideline depends on **image-guided diagnostic/prognostic injections** (IA SIJ injections and/or sacral lateral branch blocks). Patients may be effectively excluded from the guideline’s pathway to definitive procedures if they cannot safely receive these steps, for example:

- **Inability to undergo image-guided injection** when required (the guideline states **landmark-guided IA SIJ injections should not be used**; image guidance is “mandatory” for IA accuracy).
- **Contraindication to contrast** may limit fluoroscopic confirmation (ultrasound is suggested when contrast/radiation is contraindicated, but if neither is feasible, the diagnostic pathway breaks down).
- **Situations where sedation would be required for diagnostic/prognostic blocks**: the guideline recommends *against routine sedation* for diagnostic/prognostic injections because it can increase false positives. If a patient cannot tolerate blocks without sedation and no safe workaround exists, the guideline-based diagnostic validity is compromised.

## 4) Patients who are *not candidates for specific interventions covered by the guideline*
Even if someone has SIJ complex pain, they may be excluded from **parts** of the guideline (especially surgery) based on selection criteria the guideline itself lists.

### A) Exclusion from SIJ fusion selection pathway (common reasons)
The guideline’s fusion selection section says appropriate selection should include ruling out or addressing:

- **Pain not meeting the typical clinical phenotype** (e.g., not predominantly below L5, not non‑radicular, not persistent/refractory).
- **Failure to complete adequate conservative care** (they cite ≥12 weeks conservative care; ISASS criteria referenced include ~6 months of symptoms impacting QOL and failure of nonsurgical treatments).
- **Ongoing smoking** (they recommend referral for cessation; smoking is also associated with worse outcomes).
- **High-dose or ongoing opioid use** (they recommend tapering; opioid use predicts worse outcomes).
- **No confirmatory response to appropriately performed prognostic IA SIJ injections** (they recommend *dual* low-volume IA blocks without steroid and a *higher* relief threshold with functional improvement given the invasiveness—exact cutoff/number of blocks had incomplete consensus, but the concept is: without convincing block response, fusion is not guideline-supported).
- **Alternative diagnoses not ruled out** (lumbar radiculopathy, hip pathology, autoimmune arthropathy, tumor, infection, generalized pain disorders).

### B) Exclusion from sacral lateral branch RFA pathway (common reasons)
SLBRFA targets **posterior extra‑articular** innervation (posterior sacral network). Patients are poor candidates (i.e., guideline pathway doesn’t fit) when:

- The dominant pain generator is likely **anterior/ventral intra‑articular pathology** (the guideline notes deductive evidence that anterior IA pathology is associated with SLBRFA failure).
- They do not have an adequate response to a **prognostic block strategy** (the guideline favors SLBBs; commonly uses ≥50% relief as the “positive” cutoff for selection).
- Significant uncontrolled factors associated with poor response to procedures (not absolute contraindications, but often reasons to defer): **poorly controlled depression/catastrophizing, central sensitization, high disease burden**, etc.

## 5) Procedure-specific medical contraindications (not exhaustively enumerated in the paper)
The guideline discusses risk mitigation (anticoagulation, implanted devices, etc.) and implies many patients can still be treated with precautions. But standard interventional contraindications still effectively exclude patients from parts of the guideline in real-world use, such as:

- **Uncorrected coagulopathy** or situations where anticoagulation cannot be managed safely for the planned procedure (they note anticoagulants often can be continued for low-risk injections and often even for SLBRFA, but this is individualized).
- **Active systemic infection** (typical contraindication to injections/ablation/surgery).
- **Inability to cooperate/position safely** for fluoroscopy/CT/US-guided procedures.

---

### Practical way to apply “exclusion criteria”
A patient generally **cannot be managed using this guideline’s SIJ-intervention pathway** if any of the following are true:

1) Their presentation is **not primarily SIJ-complex-like** (mechanical pain below L5) or another diagnosis is more likely.  
2) They have **infection, tumor, inflammatory sacroiliitis as the main driver, fracture, or other destructive pathology** that has not been addressed.  
3) They **cannot undergo valid image-guided diagnostic/prognostic injections** needed to confirm/stratify SIJ pain.  
4) They do not meet **procedure-specific candidacy** (especially for fusion: inadequate conservative care, no convincing dual-block response with functional improvement, alternative causes not ruled out, etc.).

If you tell me which part of the guideline you mean (diagnostic injections, RFA, or fusion) and the patient scenario (age, symptoms, imaging, comorbidities, anticoagulants, pregnancy, prior fusion, etc.), I can map the **exact “cannot use / should not proceed” points** for that intervention.",painmg,exclusion_criteria_extraction
PMC4273712.txt,"## TARGET POPULATION (as stated/derivable from the guideline text)

### 1) Primary target population (patients)
**People with chronic neuropathic pain (NeP)** — i.e., pain “defined as a lesion or disease of the somatosensory system,” involving **central and/or peripheral nervous systems**.

**Included NeP presentations explicitly described (examples):**
- **Central NeP**:  
  - Poststroke pain (“thalamic pain syndrome”)  
  - Pain related to **multiple sclerosis**  
  - Pain due to **spinal cord injury**
- **Peripheral NeP**:  
  - **Painful diabetic neuropathy**  
  - **Postherpetic neuralgia**  
  - **Surgically induced NeP** (examples listed): following **thoracotomy, amputation, breast surgery, back surgery** (sometimes with nerve root fibrosis)

**Clinical context/characteristics referenced for the population:**
- NeP may be **spontaneous** (burning, tightness, shooting/lancinating) and/or **stimulus-evoked**:
  - **Allodynia** (pain from normally nonpainful stimulus)
  - **Hyperalgesia** (increased pain from painful stimulus)
- May have autonomic/trophic features suggesting **complex regional pain syndrome** (reflex sympathetic dystrophy/CRPS).

**Age group (implied):**
- The guideline is written for **adults** in practice (e.g., repeated discussion of “elderly” tolerability; no pediatric recommendations). It also explicitly notes a need for more research in **pediatric** and **geriatric** NeP, implying the guideline evidence base is mainly adult.

---

### 2) Explicit exclusions / out-of-scope populations (from trial inclusion/exclusion rules used to build recommendations)
The guideline’s evidence base **excluded** trials that:
- Studied **cancer-related neuropathic pain**, **except**:
  - **Well-defined postsurgical pain syndromes** (example given: **postmastectomy pain syndrome**)
  - **Chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain**
- Studied **trigeminal neuralgia** or **glossopharyngeal neuralgia** (stated to have their own specific medical/surgical treatments)
- Were **uncontrolled**, had **sample size <10**, etc. (methodological exclusions rather than population exclusions)

So, practically, the recommendations are aimed at **non-cancer chronic NeP**, while allowing evidence from **certain cancer-adjacent neuropathic syndromes** (post-surgical, chemo-induced) when well-defined.

---

## “Target users” (not the patient population, but explicitly stated)
The guideline explicitly states the **target users** are:
- **Physicians**
- **Nurse practitioners**
- **Other allied health care individuals** involved in NeP management

---

## Segmented “target populations” within the guideline (condition-based subgroups)

### A) Peripheral neuropathic pain populations emphasized in evidence
- **Painful diabetic neuropathy** (frequently referenced for pregabalin, duloxetine, venlafaxine, lacosamide, tapentadol evidence)
- **Postherpetic neuralgia** (notably for topical lidocaine; capsaicin discussed for localized NeP such as PHN)
- **Postsurgical/post-traumatic neuropathic pain** (mentioned in cannabinoid evidence; postsurgical syndromes included in evidence rules)

### B) Central neuropathic pain populations discussed
- **Central poststroke pain**
- **Spinal cord injury pain**
- **Multiple sclerosis–related pain**
The guideline notes it is **harder to provide a stepwise approach** for central NeP due to fewer/conflicting high-quality studies.

### C) Special populations mentioned (tolerability/knowledge gaps)
- **Elderly patients**: TCAs often “poorly tolerated in the elderly” due to anticholinergic effects; secondary amine TCAs may be better tolerated.
- **Renal insufficiency**: gabapentinoids require **dose reduction** (renal excretion).
- **Pediatric and geriatric NeP**: explicitly identified as areas needing further study (suggesting limited direct evidence).

If you upload the actual guideline file (PDF/image) rather than pasted text, I can extract the *exact* “Target Population” section verbatim (if present) and quote it precisely with page/section location.",painmg,target_population_extraction
PMC4273712.txt,"This Canadian Pain Society (CPS) consensus statement is intended to guide **pharmacologic treatment of chronic neuropathic pain (NeP)** in a general (mostly adult) Canadian clinical context. The paper does **not** present a single “do not use in these patients” list, but it *does* define important **scope limits**—i.e., patient groups and pain conditions that were **excluded from the evidence base** or are **outside the guideline’s intended application**. Those are the practical “exclusion criteria” for using the guideline as-written.

## 1) Pain conditions explicitly excluded (guideline not meant to apply)
### A. Trigeminal neuralgia and glossopharyngeal neuralgia
- The guideline states that trials were excluded if they studied **trigeminal neuralgia** or **glossopharyngeal neuralgia**.
- Rationale: these disorders have **their own specific medical and surgical treatments** (e.g., carbamazepine/oxcarbazepine as classic first-line; neurosurgical options), so the CPS NeP algorithm is **not intended** to direct care for these patients.

**So, patients whose primary diagnosis is trigeminal neuralgia or glossopharyngeal neuralgia should not be managed using this guideline’s stepwise NeP recommendations.**

### B. Cancer-related neuropathic pain (with limited exceptions)
- The evidence review **excluded cancer neuropathic pain trials**, **except**:
  - **well-defined postsurgical pain syndromes** (example given: *postmastectomy pain syndrome*), and
  - **chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain**.

**So, patients with neuropathic pain directly due to active cancer or tumor infiltration/compression are largely outside the guideline’s scope**, whereas:
- post-cancer-surgery neuropathic syndromes and
- chemotherapy-induced neuropathy  
are *within* the scope (at least in terms of included evidence).

## 2) Populations not well covered / not the intended evidence base (use with caution rather than “eligible”)
These are not stated as formal exclusions, but the guideline itself flags them as areas needing more study—meaning the recommendations may be less reliable or not directly applicable.

### A. Pediatric patients
- The summary notes a need for studies in **pediatric** NeP.
- Practical implication: **children/adolescents** were not a strong part of the RCT evidence base used to build the recommendations.

### B. Geriatric / frail older adults (tolerability concerns)
- The guideline highlights that **TCAs are poorly tolerated in the elderly** due to anticholinergic and sedating effects.
- Practical implication: older adults are not “excluded,” but the **first-line choices and dosing/titration** may need substantial modification; in some frail elders, parts of the algorithm (especially TCAs) may be inappropriate.

### C. Central neuropathic pain (limited/conflicting evidence)
- The guideline notes it is **more challenging** to provide a systematic approach for **central NeP** because of **paucity of high-quality studies and conflicting results** (e.g., post-stroke pain, spinal cord injury pain, MS-related pain).
- Practical implication: central NeP patients are not excluded, but the stepwise approach is **less evidence-secure** than for common peripheral NeP conditions (e.g., diabetic neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia).

## 3) Evidence-base exclusions that indirectly limit applicability
These are not “patient exclusions” per se, but they explain where the guideline’s recommendations may not generalize well:

- Trials with **<10 patients** were excluded (so very rare NeP subtypes may have thin evidence).
- **Uncontrolled studies** were excluded (so some treatments used in practice may not appear because they lacked RCT-quality evidence).

## 4) Important distinction: “Not covered by the guideline” vs “cannot take the drugs”
Even if a patient *is* within the guideline’s scope, they still may be unable to use specific recommended medications due to **individual contraindications** (e.g., renal impairment requiring gabapentinoid dose reduction; TCA anticholinergic burden; opioid/cannabinoid risks). Those are **drug-specific exclusions**, not exclusions from the guideline itself.

If you tell me the patient’s neuropathic pain cause (e.g., diabetic neuropathy, post-stroke pain, cancer-related, trigeminal neuralgia, etc.) and age group, I can map it clearly to “in-scope,” “out-of-scope,” or “in-scope but evidence-limited/caution.”",painmg,exclusion_criteria_extraction
PMC6637293.txt,"## TARGET POPULATION (extracted from the guideline text)

### 1) Primary target population: people with spinal cord injury (SCI) who have pain
**Target population text (verbatim / near-verbatim from the guideline):**
- “Pain is a prominent complication in spinal cord injury (SCI).”
- The guideline provides “an optimized, comprehensive and standardized pain management in **SCI-related pain**.”
- It addresses “pain **directly or indirectly caused by SCI**.”
- It covers “**nociceptive and neuropathic pain** … above or below the level of injury.”
- It is intended to “serve as a source of information for all further professional fields that are involved in the treatment of **adult individuals with acute and chronic spinal cord injury in out- and inpatient setting**.”

**Significant details (what this means in practice):**
- **Condition:** spinal cord injury (SCI).
- **Problem addressed:** pain related to SCI, including:
  - **Nociceptive pain** (e.g., musculoskeletal; visceral pain often related to neurogenic bladder/bowel complications).
  - **Neuropathic pain** (central/peripheral; at-level and below-level are discussed).
- **Timing:** includes **acute and chronic** SCI (and pain occurring early or later after injury).
- **Setting:** **outpatient and inpatient** care.
- **Age:** explicitly **adult individuals** (the guideline repeatedly frames its scope around adults).

## Sub-populations explicitly distinguished within the target population (segmented)

### 2) Adults with SCI-related nociceptive pain
**Target population text (verbatim / near-verbatim):**
- “Nociceptive pain is defined as pain that is caused by either an irritation or an injury of body tissue, without an associated impairment of somatosensory structures.”
- “Statement 3.1 **Nociceptive pain ought to be examined** …”
- “**Visceral pain is most commonly due to complications regarding neurogenic bladder and bowel dysfunction.**”

**Significant details:**
- Includes **musculoskeletal nociceptive pain** (often from overuse/biomechanics, wheelchair seating, transfers, immobilization, pressure sores, etc., as discussed in the body).
- Includes **visceral nociceptive pain**, commonly linked to **neurogenic bladder/bowel dysfunction** complications.
- The guideline emphasizes structured clinical evaluation of body regions exposed to exertion after SCI.

---

### 3) Adults with SCI-related neuropathic pain
**Target population text (verbatim / near-verbatim):**
- “According to the International Association for the Study of Pain, neuropathic pain is defined as ‘pain arising as a direct consequence of a lesion or disease affecting the somatosensory system’…”
- “Statement 3.2 **SCI-related neuropathic pain should be clinically evaluated** as follows…”
- “Statement 6.9 **Treatment of neuropathic pain is primarily a symptomatic therapy**…”

**Significant details:**
- Neuropathic pain may occur **above or below the level of injury** (explicitly stated earlier in the abstract).
- The guideline provides a neuropathic pain clinical screen including features such as:
  - onset within first year,
  - no competing causes (e.g., wounds/ulcers),
  - not movement-dependent,
  - burning/tingling/electrical/squeezing/freezing qualities,
  - location in an area of abnormal sensation (hypesthesia/allodynia/hyperalgesia).
- It also distinguishes treatment considerations by lesion completeness in at least one place (e.g., lamotrigine: not suggested in complete SCI; may be considered in incomplete SCI).

---

### 4) Adults with SCI-related pain where psychological factors influence pain perception (comorbid psychological contribution)
**Target population text (verbatim / near-verbatim):**
- “Statement 2.2 **In case psychological factors influence pain perception**, this ought to be considered as ‘chronic pain disorder with somatic and psychological factors’ according to… ICD-10…”
- The guideline also notes screening for “psychological comorbidities.”

**Significant details:**
- This is not a separate disease group, but a **recognized subgroup** within SCI pain where psychological factors are relevant to assessment/classification and management.

## “Audience” (not the patient target population, but explicitly stated users)
Although not the target population, the guideline explicitly states who it is written for:
- “This guideline addresses **physicians and therapists**… (e.g. neurologists, physiatrists, pain specialists, orthopedists, psychotherapists).”
- It should serve as a source of information for professionals involved in treating **adult individuals with acute and chronic SCI** in **out- and inpatient** settings.

---

## Consolidated TARGET POPULATION statement (cleaned, guideline-faithful)
**Adult individuals with acute or chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) in inpatient or outpatient settings who experience pain directly or indirectly related to SCI, including nociceptive (musculoskeletal/visceral) and neuropathic pain (at-level and/or below-level), with consideration of psychological factors when they influence pain perception.**",painmg,target_population_extraction
PMC6637293.txt,"The guideline is **not meant to be used for everyone with pain**, but specifically for a defined target population. Patients “excluded” are mainly those who fall **outside the intended scope** (population/setting) or where the pain problem is **not SCI-related** in the sense used by the guideline.

## 1) Population exclusions (who the guideline is not written for)

### A. Children and adolescents
- The guideline explicitly addresses **adult** individuals with SCI (“adult individuals with acute and chronic spinal cord injury…”).
- Therefore, **pediatric SCI patients** are outside the guideline’s intended population.

### B. People without spinal cord injury (SCI)
- If a person has pain but **no SCI**, the guideline does not apply.

### C. People with pain that is not directly or indirectly caused by SCI
The guideline is for pain **“directly or indirectly caused by SCI.”**  
So it does **not** apply when the main pain condition is unrelated to SCI, for example:
- primary headache disorders (migraine, cluster) as the main issue
- cancer pain unrelated to SCI
- acute surgical/trauma pain unrelated to SCI
- unrelated rheumatologic pain syndromes, etc.

## 2) Diagnostic exclusions (when the pain should not be classified/treated as SCI-related neuropathic pain)

In its neuropathic pain diagnostic statement, the guideline stresses ruling out **“competing causes of pain.”** If a competing cause explains the pain better, then the SCI-neuropathic-pain pathway of this guideline should not be used as the primary framework.

Examples explicitly mentioned or implied:
- **skin lesions / ulcers / wounds**
- **scars**
- pain clearly **dependent on movement/manipulation** of the painful area (suggesting a musculoskeletal/mechanical generator rather than neuropathic pain)
- other non-SCI explanations for neuropathic-like symptoms (the text gives **fibromyalgia-related allodynia** as an example of a competing cause to keep in mind)

Practical meaning: if the pain is better explained by another diagnosis (e.g., pressure injury, radiculopathy from a new disc herniation, peripheral entrapment neuropathy, infection, fracture, visceral pathology not attributable to SCI complications), then **treat that cause first** and don’t label/manage it primarily as “SCI-related neuropathic pain” per this guideline.

## 3) Setting/usage exclusions (where the guideline is not intended to function as a “permission” to treat)

### A. It is not a drug-approval or prescribing-eligibility document
The guideline repeatedly notes that:
- evidence is limited, and
- **drug approvals differ by country**, and
- some uses are **off-label** (example given: gabapentin for central below-level neuropathic pain in Germany).

So a patient may be “excluded” from a *specific recommendation* if:
- the therapy is **contraindicated** for them (e.g., due to comorbidities, interactions, pregnancy—though pregnancy is not discussed in the excerpt), or
- the therapy is **not approved/available** in the jurisdiction, or
- informed consent for **off-label** use is not possible/appropriate.

This is not an SCI-specific exclusion, but it limits applicability.

## 4) What the guideline does *not* exclude (common misunderstandings)
- It does **not** restrict to a specific neurological level or completeness overall; it covers acute/chronic SCI broadly.
- It does not exclude people with psychological comorbidity; instead it says psychological factors should be considered diagnostically (ICD-10 “chronic pain disorder with somatic and psychological factors”).

## Bottom line (exclusion criteria in one list)
You generally **cannot use this guideline as intended** for:
1. **Non-adults** (children/adolescents).
2. People **without SCI**.
3. People whose pain is **not directly/indirectly SCI-related**.
4. Cases where the pain is better explained by a **competing cause** (e.g., ulcers/wounds, scars, clearly mechanical pain behavior, other non-SCI pain syndromes), meaning the SCI-pain framework should not be the primary guide.
5. Situations where a recommended intervention is **not legally/clinically applicable** (contraindications, interactions, jurisdictional approval limits, or off-label use without appropriate consent).

If you tell me the patient’s age, SCI characteristics, pain location/quality, and suspected cause, I can map whether they fall inside or outside the guideline scope and which parts would still apply.",painmg,exclusion_criteria_extraction
PMC7187257.txt,"## TARGET POPULATION (extracted from the provided guideline text)

The guideline does not contain a single explicit “Target population” heading/paragraph in the way your examples do. However, the target population is clearly defined throughout the abstract/introduction and is consistent across the document:

### Primary target population (overall scope)
**Patients undergoing oncological breast surgery (breast cancer surgery)** who require **procedure-specific postoperative pain management** (acute pain control, with attention to chronic pain risk).

**Key details stated in the guideline text:**
- The guideline is for **pain management after oncological breast surgery** (“hereafter simply referred to as breast surgery”).
- It addresses **postoperative pain** outcomes (primary outcome: postoperative pain scores) and other recovery outcomes (e.g., opioid requirements, adverse effects, postoperative nausea/vomiting).
- Evidence base is **randomised controlled trials and meta-analyses** of analgesic/anaesthetic/surgical interventions in this surgical population.

---

## Segmented target populations (by procedure intensity, as described in the guideline)

The document implicitly separates patients by **type/extent of breast surgery**, because recommended analgesic techniques differ for “minor-to-moderately invasive” vs “major” breast surgery.

### 1) Minor-to-moderately invasive oncological breast surgery
**Target population segment:** Patients scheduled for **less invasive breast cancer operations**, explicitly including:
- **Lumpectomy**
- **Partial mastectomy**

**Relevant details from the guideline:**
- Postoperative pain after these procedures is described as typically **mild-to-moderate** and **decreases over the first couple of postoperative days**.
- **Local anaesthetic wound infiltration** is specifically suggested/considered for this group (noted as limited duration analgesia).

---

### 2) Major oncological breast surgery
**Target population segment:** Patients scheduled for **more invasive breast cancer operations**, explicitly including:
- **Mastectomy** (with or without additional procedures)
- **Mastectomy with or without axillary node dissection/axillary clearance**

**Relevant details from the guideline:**
- **Paravertebral block** is recommended/considered for major breast surgery.
- Studies in this population showed associations with:
  - **Lower postoperative pain scores**
  - **Lower systemic analgesia consumption**
  - **Reduced postoperative nausea and vomiting**
  - **Shorter length of hospital stay** (compared with general anaesthesia alone in the cited studies)

---

## What is *not* explicitly defined (limitations of the provided text)
The excerpt you provided does **not** explicitly specify:
- Age limits (e.g., adult-only)  
- Cancer stage or pathology criteria  
- Inclusion/exclusion criteria such as reconstruction vs no reconstruction, outpatient vs inpatient, etc.  
- A formal “outside scope” statement (e.g., non-oncologic breast surgery)

If you upload the full PDF (or additional pages), I can extract any formal “Target population / Scope / Intended users / Inclusion–exclusion” section verbatim if it exists elsewhere in the guideline.",painmg,target_population_extraction
PMC7187257.txt,"This PROSPECT guideline is **procedure-specific** (oncological breast surgery) and is intended for **typical adult patients** undergoing operations such as lumpectomy/partial mastectomy or mastectomy (± axillary surgery). It is **not a “one-size-fits-all” protocol**: patients who have contraindications to one or more recommended components, or who fall outside the population studied in the evidence base, should not be managed strictly “by the guideline” without modification.

Below are the practical **exclusion / “do not apply as written”** situations—grouped by *who the guideline does not cover well* and *who cannot receive key recommended interventions*.

---

## 1) Patients outside the population/scope the guideline is based on
These patients are not necessarily “forbidden,” but the guideline evidence is limited and it should not be applied without individualization:

- **Non-oncological breast surgery** (e.g., purely cosmetic augmentation/reduction, reconstructive-only procedures not in the oncologic pathway), because pain profiles and techniques differ.
- **Extensive reconstructive surgery combined with mastectomy** (e.g., free flap/DIEP, latissimus dorsi flap) where pain sources and analgesic needs are different and often greater; the guideline is mainly framed around oncologic breast procedures rather than major reconstructive pain pathways.
- **Paediatric/adolescent patients** (PROSPECT breast surgery evidence is overwhelmingly adult).
- **Patients in whom enhanced recovery pathways, chronic opioid use, or complex pain syndromes dominate management** (the guideline discusses multimodal analgesia but the trials often exclude or under-represent these complex groups).

---

## 2) Patients who cannot receive the “basic analgesics” (paracetamol + NSAID/COX-2)
The guideline recommends these “unless contraindicated.” If contraindicated, the guideline cannot be followed as written.

### A) Paracetamol (acetaminophen) should be avoided/modified in:
- **Severe hepatic impairment/active severe liver disease** or situations with high risk of hepatotoxicity.
- **Heavy chronic alcohol use** or other high-risk contexts where clinicians would reduce dose/avoid.
- **Allergy/intolerance** to paracetamol.

### B) NSAIDs / COX-2 inhibitors should be avoided in (typical contraindications):
- **NSAID hypersensitivity**, including aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease.
- **Active peptic ulcer disease or recent GI bleeding** (or very high GI-bleed risk without protection).
- **Significant renal impairment**, dehydration, or other high AKI-risk states.
- **Uncontrolled heart failure** or high cardiovascular risk where NSAIDs/COX-2 are inappropriate.
- **Clinically important bleeding risk** or when the surgical/haematology context makes NSAIDs undesirable.
- **Pregnancy (especially later gestation)** (general NSAID contraindication).

If a patient cannot take NSAIDs, the “foundation” of the PROSPECT regimen is incomplete and an alternative multimodal plan is needed.

---

## 3) Patients who should not receive pre-operative gabapentin (or only with strong caution)
The guideline recommends pre-op gabapentin but explicitly notes caution due to sedation/dizziness—especially relevant for ambulatory patients. Patients who often should **not** receive it (or need dose reduction/close monitoring) include:

- **Marked frailty/older adults at high fall or delirium risk**
- **Baseline sedation, obstructive sleep apnoea with high respiratory risk**, or when combined with other sedatives/opioids
- **Significant renal impairment** (gabapentin is renally cleared; accumulation increases adverse effects)
- **History of severe gabapentinoid adverse reactions** (confusion, severe dizziness, misuse)
- **Patients at risk of misuse/dependence** (gabapentinoids have recognized abuse potential in some settings)

If gabapentin is inappropriate, that element of the guideline should be omitted and replaced with other options.

---

## 4) Patients who should not receive IV dexamethasone (single dose) or need caution
The guideline recommends a single IV dose for analgesic and antiemetic benefit. Patients who may be **excluded** from this recommendation (or require individualized risk–benefit) include:

- **Uncontrolled diabetes or brittle diabetes** (risk of significant peri-operative hyperglycaemia)
- **Active systemic infection or poorly controlled infection** (steroid immunomodulation concerns)
- **Known hypersensitivity** to dexamethasone
- **Situations where the surgical/oncology team prefers to avoid peri-operative steroids** (institutional policies vary; evidence generally supports safety for single-dose use, but practice differs)

If dexamethasone is contraindicated, antiemetic and analgesic plans need adjustment.

---

## 5) Patients who cannot receive the recommended regional techniques (paravertebral block / PECS) or wound infiltration
The guideline recommends paravertebral block first-line for major surgery, with PECS as an alternative, and/or wound infiltration. These cannot be applied in patients with standard contraindications to regional/local anaesthesia techniques, such as:

- **Patient refusal**
- **Local infection at the injection site**
- **Uncorrected coagulopathy or anticoagulation that makes the block unsafe** (exact thresholds depend on the drug and timing; follow ASRA/ESRA or local neuraxial/regional anticoagulation guidance)
- **Allergy to local anaesthetics**
- **Anatomical distortion or prior surgery/radiation** that makes the block unsafe or unreliable (case-by-case)
- **Severe pulmonary compromise** where any complication risk (e.g., pneumothorax with thoracic techniques) is unacceptable (risk is low with ultrasound guidance but not zero)

If regional techniques are contraindicated, the guideline’s “major breast surgery” pathway must be modified.

---

## 6) Patients for whom “opioids only as rescue” is not realistic
The guideline advises reserving opioids for rescue. This may not be feasible without modification in:

- **Patients already on chronic opioids** (tolerance/withdrawal risk; they often need baseline opioid continuation plus multimodal adjuncts)
- **Patients with severe pre-existing pain conditions** requiring higher baseline analgesia
- **Patients undergoing more extensive procedures than the guideline’s typical scope** (e.g., major reconstruction)

---

### Bottom line
There isn’t a single “exclusion list” in the text like a drug trial would have; instead, the guideline is **conditional**: it applies to oncological breast surgery patients **only when** the recommended components are not contraindicated. The main groups who “cannot use it as written” are those with contraindications to **(1) paracetamol/NSAIDs, (2) gabapentin, (3) dexamethasone, or (4) regional/local anaesthetic techniques**, plus patients outside the intended surgical population (notably major reconstruction, paediatrics, and complex chronic opioid users).

If you tell me the **exact operation** (lumpectomy vs mastectomy ± axillary dissection ± reconstruction) and key comorbidities (renal function, diabetes, anticoagulants, OSA, chronic opioids), I can map which parts of the guideline would be excluded for that patient and what is typically substituted.",painmg,exclusion_criteria_extraction
PMC6023582.txt,"## TARGET POPULATION (extracted from the guideline text) — Acute pain ketamine consensus guideline

This guideline does not present a single, boxed “Target Population” section. Instead, the target population is described across the “Which Patients and Acute Pain Conditions Should Be Considered for Ketamine Treatment?” section and related discussion. Below is the **verbatim/near-verbatim target-population language** pulled from those parts, organized into distinct target populations, with key details preserved.

---

## 1) Patients undergoing surgery with **expected severe postoperative pain** (perioperative use)

**Extracted target-population text (key passages):**
- “**patients who benefit most** fall into several broad categories. **The first group of patients are those undergoing surgery in which the expected postoperative pain will be severe.**”
- “This includes **upper abdominal and thoracic surgery**, where the greatest benefit in opioid reduction has been reported, as well as **lower abdominal, intra-abdominal, and orthopedic (limb and spine) procedures**.”
- “Patients undergoing procedures with expected **mild levels of pain**, such as **tonsillectomy and head and neck surgery, have not been shown to benefit** from perioperative ketamine.”

**Significant details / scope notes:**
- Focus is **acute pain** in the **perioperative** setting using **subanesthetic ketamine**.
- The guideline explicitly distinguishes **severe-pain surgeries** (more likely to benefit) vs **mild-pain surgeries** (not shown to benefit).

---

## 2) **Opioid-tolerant or opioid-dependent** patients (surgical and some nonsurgical acute exacerbations)

**Extracted target-population text (key passages):**
- “Another group of patients who may be considered for acute ketamine therapy are those who are **opioid tolerant or opioid dependent and presenting for surgery** or those with an **acute exacerbation of a chronic condition**.”
- “**Ketamine may be considered for opioid-dependent or opioid-tolerant patients undergoing surgery**…”
- “**Opioid-dependent nonsurgical patients might benefit from ketamine during acute exacerbations of chronic pain conditions.**”

**Significant details / scope notes:**
- Includes **opioid-tolerant/dependent surgical patients** (e.g., major spine surgery is discussed as an example evidence base).
- Also includes **nonsurgical** patients when they present with **acute exacerbations** of chronic painful conditions (the guideline gives examples, including sickle cell pain—see next section).

---

## 3) Patients with **sickle cell disease** experiencing acute pain (including acute-on-chronic pain)

**Extracted target-population text (key passages):**
- “In patients with **sickle cell disease**, several case reports suggest that ketamine improves analgesia in adults as well as children.”
- “Because evidence is limited to case reports and series as well as the clinical experience of the committee, **ketamine may be considered for opioid-dependent or opioid-tolerant patients with acute or chronic sickle cell pain**…”

**Significant details / scope notes:**
- The guideline frames this as a **consideration** based mainly on **case reports/series** (i.e., limited high-quality evidence).
- The population is described particularly in the context of **opioid-dependent/opioid-tolerant** sickle cell patients, and **acute or chronic sickle cell pain**.

---

## 4) Patients at increased risk for **opioid-related respiratory depression** (e.g., obstructive sleep apnea)

**Extracted target-population text (key passages):**
- “The last subset of patients for whom ketamine may be beneficial is those who are at increased risk for **opioid-related respiratory depression**, such as those with **obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)**.”
- “For patients with sleep apnea, **ketamine may be considered as an adjunct to limit opioids**…”

**Significant details / scope notes:**
- The rationale is **opioid-sparing** to reduce risk related to opioids in vulnerable patients.
- The guideline notes that evidence for respiratory outcomes is **less clear** because many studies did not directly measure respiratory depression incidence.

---

## 5) Acute pain contexts explicitly named as settings where ketamine is used (broader “acute pain” scope)

**Extracted target-population text (key passages):**
- “Ketamine is most commonly used for acute pain management in the settings of **trauma**, **exacerbation of chronic painful conditions**, and **postsurgical pain**, particularly in patients who are opioid tolerant.”

**Significant details / scope notes:**
- This sentence functions like a **high-level scope statement** for where the guideline’s acute pain recommendations are intended to apply.

---

## 6) Patients for whom **intranasal (IN) ketamine** may be considered (access/procedural scenarios)

**Extracted target-population text (key passages):**
- “Particular scenarios in which this should be considered include **individuals for whom IV access is difficult and children undergoing procedures**…”

**Significant details / scope notes:**
- This is specifically tied to **nonparenteral ketamine** (especially **intranasal**) in acute pain/procedural contexts.
- The guideline also discusses emergency medicine studies in **acute traumatic pain** and **renal colic**, but the clearest “who should be considered” language is the IV-access-difficult and pediatric-procedure statement.

---

## 7) Patients receiving **IV-PCA ketamine** (alone or with opioids) for acute/perioperative pain

**Extracted target-population text (key passages):**
- “Ketamine has also been used in **IV-PCA** as the **sole analgesic** and in **combination with opioids** to improve pain control and reduce opioid-related adverse effects.”
- “We conclude that evidence is limited for the benefit of **IV-PCA–delivered ketamine as the sole analgesic for acute or periprocedural pain**…”
- “We conclude that moderate evidence supports the benefit of the **addition of ketamine to an opioid-based IV-PCA for acute and perioperative pain management**…”

**Significant details / scope notes:**
- This defines a target population by **delivery method** (IV-PCA) and **setting** (acute/periprocedural/perioperative).

---

### Exclusions / “outside target” signals explicitly stated
- Surgeries with **mild expected pain**: “tonsillectomy and head and neck surgery… **have not been shown to benefit**.”
- The guideline also repeatedly emphasizes **subanesthetic dosing** for acute pain contexts (i.e., not general-anesthetic use), which effectively narrows the intended population to patients being treated for analgesia rather than anesthesia.

---

If you want, I can convert the above into a single standardized “TARGET POPULATION” paragraph (like your examples) that consolidates all included groups and explicitly lists exclusions.",painmg,target_population_extraction
PMC6023582.txt,"The guideline’s “exclusion criteria” are essentially the **contraindications and relative contraindications** for using **subanesthetic IV ketamine infusions for acute pain**. The document emphasizes that the evidence base is limited because most trials enrolled relatively healthy patients, so many exclusions are based on (1) traditional anesthetic ketamine contraindications and (2) expert consensus risk–benefit judgment.

Below are the patient groups the guideline indicates **should not receive ketamine** (avoid) or **generally should not receive it unless there is a compelling reason and close monitoring** (relative contraindications / use with caution).

---

## 1) Patients the guideline says to **avoid** ketamine in (practical “do not use” groups)

### A. **Pregnancy**
- The guideline states ketamine should be **avoided in pregnancy** (listed with grade B evidence/moderate certainty).
- Many perioperative RCTs explicitly excluded pregnant patients.

### B. **Active psychosis / poorly controlled psychotic disorders**
- Ketamine should be **avoided in active psychosis** (e.g., schizophrenia with active psychotic symptoms), also cited with grade B evidence/moderate certainty.
- Rationale: ketamine can worsen psychotomimetic effects (hallucinations, dissociation), and trials commonly excluded patients with psychosis.

### C. **Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP)**
- The guideline indicates ketamine should be **avoided** in patients with **elevated ICP** (grade C, low certainty).
- Note: the document acknowledges controversy historically, but still recommends avoidance given uncertainty.

### D. **Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) / glaucoma**
- The guideline indicates ketamine should be **avoided** in patients with **elevated IOP** (grade C, low certainty).
- Many studies excluded glaucoma/elevated IOP.

### E. **Severe hepatic dysfunction (e.g., cirrhosis)**
- The guideline supports **avoiding ketamine infusions** in **severe liver disease** (grade C, low certainty).
- Rationale: reports of significant liver enzyme elevations with repeat/prolonged infusions and with high anesthetic bolus dosing; risk is higher when baseline hepatic reserve is poor.

---

## 2) Patients the guideline treats as **relative contraindications / “use only with caution”**

These are not always absolute “exclusions,” but in many institutions they function as *practical exclusions* unless the setting can support close monitoring and the benefit is compelling.

### A. **Poorly controlled cardiovascular disease**
- The guideline highlights **poorly controlled cardiovascular disease** as a key relative contraindication (for acute pain: grade C/moderate certainty; for chronic pain it was graded more strongly).
- Examples the text specifically calls out:
  - **High-risk coronary artery disease**
  - **Uncontrolled hypertension** (commonly excluded in RCTs)
  - “Severe cardiopulmonary disease” (as used in trial exclusion criteria)
- Rationale: ketamine can increase sympathetic tone → ↑HR/↑BP and may provoke ischemia/arrhythmias in vulnerable patients.

### B. **Moderate hepatic dysfunction**
- For **moderate liver disease**, the guideline recommends **caution** rather than absolute avoidance:
  - Check **liver function tests before** infusion and **monitor during** infusion (surveillance for elevations).
- Rationale: potential hepatotoxicity signal in some infusion studies, especially with repeated exposures.

### C. **Significant renal disease / serious systemic disease (as commonly excluded in trials)**
- While the guideline’s strongest “avoid” language is focused on severe hepatic disease, psychosis, pregnancy, elevated ICP/IOP, it notes that many RCTs excluded patients with:
  - **Serious renal disease / renal failure**
  - **Serious cardiovascular disease**
  - **“Hepatorenal dysfunction”**
- Practical implication: evidence is thin in these groups; many protocols treat them as “avoid or only in higher-acuity monitored settings.”

### D. **Altered mental status (common trial exclusion)**
- Several acute pain RCTs excluded **altered mental status**.
- Practical implication: if a patient cannot participate in symptom reporting or has delirium/encephalopathy, ketamine’s neuropsychiatric effects are harder to detect/manage and may worsen confusion.

---

## 3) Substance use disorder: **not an acute-pain exclusion**, but still a risk consideration
- The guideline explicitly discusses ketamine’s abuse potential.
- It concludes there is **little/no evidence** that **brief inpatient exposure** increases later ketamine addiction risk, and notes that in many acute pain cases the alternative (opioids) may be worse—especially in opioid use disorder with high tolerance.
- So **active substance abuse is *not* treated as a contraindication for acute pain** in the way it may be for chronic pain infusions, but it should be **assessed case-by-case**.

---

## 4) “Cannot use this guideline” due to setting/personnel limitations (operational exclusions)
Even if a patient is medically eligible, the guideline implies ketamine infusions **should not be done** in environments that cannot meet safety requirements:

- If the responsible clinician/team is **not trained in airway management and ACLS**, or the monitoring nurse is not appropriately trained (the guideline describes an ACLS-certified RN with additional moderate-sedation/ketamine training, under direction of an appropriately credentialed physician).
- If the care area cannot provide **appropriate monitoring** for patients who might become unresponsive or develop hemodynamic/neuropsychiatric adverse effects.
- If the planned dosing exceeds what the setting can safely monitor (the guideline notes infusions generally **should not exceed 1 mg/kg/hr without intensive monitoring**).

These are not “patient exclusions,” but they are real-world reasons a patient may be unable to receive ketamine under the guideline.

---

## Summary list (quick reference)

**Avoid ketamine (generally exclude):**
- Pregnancy  
- Active psychosis / poorly controlled psychotic disorder  
- Elevated intracranial pressure  
- Elevated intraocular pressure / glaucoma  
- Severe hepatic dysfunction (e.g., cirrhosis)

**Relative contraindications / use with caution (often excluded unless monitored and benefit is high):**
- Poorly controlled cardiovascular disease (e.g., uncontrolled HTN, high-risk CAD, severe cardiopulmonary disease)
- Moderate hepatic dysfunction (monitor LFTs)
- Serious renal disease / major systemic illness (limited evidence; many trials excluded)
- Altered mental status (common trial exclusion; practical safety concern)

If you tell me the patient’s key comorbidities (cardiac history, liver disease stage/LFTs, psychiatric history, pregnancy status, neuro/eye issues, current vitals), I can map them to the above categories in a structured way.",painmg,exclusion_criteria_extraction
PMC6135479.txt,"## TARGET POPULATION (extracted from the guideline text)

### Primary target population (who the recommendations are for)
- **Adult patients (≥18 years)** with **known or suspected obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)** who are receiving **intraoperative care** (i.e., anesthesia management during procedures/surgery).
  - The guideline repeatedly frames its recommendations around **“patients with OSA”** and includes both:
    - **Diagnosed OSA** (e.g., confirmed by polysomnography or documented diagnosis), and
    - **Suspected/high-risk OSA** (e.g., identified by screening tools such as **STOP-Bang**, clinical assessment, history, chart diagnosis, or administrative codes).

### Clinical setting / scope of care
- The guideline is specifically about **intraoperative management** of OSA, including:
  - **Airway management** (e.g., difficult intubation/mask ventilation precautions)
  - **Effects/selection of anesthetic drugs and agents** (e.g., opioids, propofol, benzodiazepines, neuromuscular blockers)
  - **Choice of anesthesia technique** (e.g., regional vs general anesthesia)

### Population explicitly NOT included (outside scope)
- **Patients with sleep-disordered breathing unrelated to OSA**, specifically:
  - **Hypoventilation syndromes**
  - **Periodic breathing**
  - **Central apnea unrelated to OSA**

### Evidence base population constraints (how the included evidence was bounded)
These are not “clinical exclusions” per se, but they define the population the guideline’s evidence review is based on:
- **Adults only (≥18 years)** (explicitly stated in the literature search strategy)
- **English-language publications**
- Evidence for “OSA” status in included studies could be based on:
  - Polysomnography (gold standard)
  - Screening questionnaires (e.g., STOP-Bang, Berlin)
  - Clinical assessment / history
  - Chart diagnosis
  - ICD-9 codes / administrative data

---

## Segmented target populations within the guideline (practical subgroups the recommendations address)

### 1) Known or suspected OSA patients with airway-management risk
- **Target subgroup:** Adults with **known or suspected OSA** where airway management is relevant.
- **Key detail from guideline:** OSA (known or suspected) should be treated as an **independent risk factor** for:
  - **Difficult intubation**
  - **Difficult mask ventilation**
  - Or **both**
- **Implication:** This subgroup is central to the guideline’s recommendation to take **difficult-airway precautions**.

### 2) OSA patients receiving specific intraoperative medications (drug-exposure subpopulations)
The guideline effectively defines target populations by **exposure** (patients with OSA who receive certain agents):

- **OSA + neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs)**
  - Subgroup: OSA patients who receive NMBAs intraoperatively
  - Concern: higher risk of **residual neuromuscular blockade effects**, **hypoxemia**, **respiratory failure**

- **OSA + opioids**
  - Subgroup: OSA patients receiving opioid analgesics
  - Concern: increased risk of **opioid-related adverse respiratory events**
  - Additional nuance: guideline flags possible **altered pain perception/opioid potency** in OSA (linked to intermittent hypoxia/sleep fragmentation)

- **OSA + propofol for procedural sedation**
  - Subgroup: OSA patients sedated with propofol for procedures (examples given: **DISE**, GI endoscopy, dentistry)
  - Concern: increased risk of **adverse respiratory events/hypoxemia**
  - Note: the guideline explicitly says it is focusing here on **procedural sedation contexts**, not propofol for induction of general anesthesia.

- **OSA + intravenous benzodiazepine sedation**
  - Subgroup: OSA patients receiving IV benzodiazepines (often midazolam; also diazepam discussed)
  - Concern: **airway compromise**; guideline states IV benzodiazepines should be used **with caution**

- **OSA + other agents where evidence is insufficient**
  - Inhalational agents: insufficient OSA-specific evidence to make a recommendation
  - Ketamine: insufficient OSA-specific evidence
  - α-2 agonists (dexmedetomidine/clonidine): insufficient comparative evidence in OSA vs non-OSA

### 3) OSA patients where anesthesia technique choice is relevant (regional vs general)
- **Target subgroup:** Adults with OSA undergoing procedures where **regional anesthesia is feasible/applicable**
- **Guideline position:** “When applicable, **regional anesthesia is preferable** over general anesthesia in patients with OSA.”
- This subgroup is defined by **procedure suitability** for regional techniques and the ability to avoid/limit general anesthesia–related risks (airway manipulation, NMBA use, opioid needs).

---

## One-sentence consolidated TARGET POPULATION statement (faithful to the guideline)
**Adult patients (≥18 years) with known or suspected obstructive sleep apnea undergoing procedures requiring intraoperative anesthesia care (airway management, anesthetic drug selection, and anesthesia technique decisions), excluding patients with non-OSA sleep-disordered breathing such as hypoventilation syndromes, periodic breathing, or central apnea unrelated to OSA.**

If you upload the PDF/image of the guideline pages (instead of pasted text), I can also extract the *exact* “Target Population” heading/section verbatim if it exists in the formatted document.",painmg,target_population_extraction
PMC6135479.txt,"This SASM guideline is intended for **intraoperative management of adult (≥18 years) patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)**. Patients (or situations) in which it **should not be applied** fall into two main buckets: **(A) populations the guideline explicitly did not cover**, and **(B) evidence-generation exclusions (what the authors excluded from the literature), which signal areas where the guideline’s recommendations are not supported and therefore should be used cautiously or may not apply.**

## A) Patient populations explicitly not covered (true “cannot use” groups)

### 1) Children / adolescents
- The guideline’s scope is **adults only (≥18 years)**.
- Therefore, **pediatric OSA** patients are outside the intended population.

### 2) Sleep-disordered breathing that is *not* obstructive sleep apnea
The authors state they **did not consider** patients with sleep-disordered breathing **unrelated to OSA**, specifically including:
- **Hypoventilation syndromes** (e.g., non-OSA hypoventilation disorders)
- **Periodic breathing**
- **Central apnea unrelated to OSA** (i.e., primary/central sleep apnea syndromes rather than obstructive events)

So, if a patient’s primary disorder is **central sleep apnea** or **non-OSA hypoventilation**, this guideline is **not designed** for them.

> Note: The search terms mention “obesity hypoventilation syndrome,” but the narrative scope statement says *sleep-disordered breathing unrelated to OSA* (including hypoventilation syndromes) was not considered. Practically, for **OHS** (obesity hypoventilation syndrome), you should not assume this guideline fully applies unless the patient is being managed specifically as an **OSA** patient and you also incorporate OHS-specific guidance.

## B) Situations where the guideline’s evidence base does not apply well (use with caution / not directly applicable)

These are not always “patients who cannot use the guideline,” but they are **important exclusion signals**: the task force **excluded** certain study types and topics, meaning recommendations may be weaker or not directly applicable in these scenarios.

### 3) Patients where the key issue is *chronic* (not intraoperative) medication use—especially chronic opioids
The evidence review excluded:
- Studies “reporting on the **chronic use** of medications commonly used intraoperatively such as **chronic opioid medication**.”

Implication:
- If a patient is on **long-term opioids** (or other chronically used sedating/analgesic agents), the guideline’s intraoperative medication risk statements (especially opioid-related) may not fully capture their risk profile (tolerance, hyperalgesia, baseline hypoventilation risk, etc.). You’ll need additional chronic-opioid perioperative guidance.

### 4) Patients with OSA in contexts not represented by the included evidence (because of study-design exclusions)
The evidence synthesis excluded:
- **Single case reports**
- **Review articles** (as evidence sources for recommendations)
- **Studies without outcome reporting**
- **Non-English** studies
- **Nonhuman** studies

Implication:
- For rare/highly complex OSA scenarios where only case reports exist (or where outcomes are not well studied), the guideline may not be reliably applicable.

### 5) For “anesthesia technique” decisions: patients/procedures where no direct comparison of anesthesia modalities exists
For the anesthesia-technique section (Group 3), the review excluded:
- Studies **not directly comparing anesthesia modalities** (e.g., general vs neuraxial/regional).

Implication:
- If your patient/procedure type doesn’t have evidence comparing techniques, the “prefer regional when feasible” recommendation may be less directly supported for that specific setting.

## Practical “do not apply as written” checklist
You should not apply this guideline as the primary guide if the patient is:
1. **<18 years old**
2. Has sleep-disordered breathing primarily due to **central sleep apnea**, **periodic breathing**, or a **hypoventilation syndrome** not treated as OSA
3. Has a perioperative plan dominated by **chronic opioid therapy** considerations (needs additional, condition-specific guidance)

If you tell me the patient’s age, diagnosis (OSA vs central/OHS), and whether they use chronic opioids/sedatives, I can map them to “in scope,” “out of scope,” or “in scope but needs additional guidance.”",painmg,exclusion_criteria_extraction

### 1) **Older adults with pain (core target population)**
**Extracted scope language (most direct):**
- “**All pain assessment interventions in adult humans with malignant and non-malignant pain over 65 years of age were considered.**”
- The guideline is repeatedly framed as “**pain assessment in older people / older adults**” and “**older population**.”

**Significant details included in-scope:**
- **Age:** primarily **>65 years** (explicit in Methods), with searches also described as “adults over **60** years of age” in the search strategy section.
- **Pain types:** **acute and chronic**, and **malignant and non-malignant** pain.
- **Care settings:** “**All care settings were considered** including:  
  - **acute hospital setting**,  
  - **geriatric hospitals**, and  
  - **the community** including: **retirement apartments, residential homes, nursing homes and other long term care settings**.”

### 2) **Older adults with cognitive impairment / dementia (specific target subgroup)**
**Extracted scope language:**
- “Patients **with and without cognitive impairment**… were included.”
- Executive summary: “A number of valid and reliable self-report measures are available and can be used even when **moderate dementia** exists.”
- Executive summary: “For people with **severe cognitive impairment** PAINAD and Doloplus-2 are recommended.”
- Section framing: “**Pain assessment in cognitive impairment**.”

**Significant details:**
- Includes older adults with **mild, moderate, and severe cognitive impairment**, including **dementia**.
- Emphasizes that **self-report remains the preferred indicator** when possible, even with **moderate dementia**, but recommends **observational/behavioural tools** for **severe impairment** (e.g., **PAINAD**, **Doloplus-2**; Abbey scale noted as widely used but with limited recent validation).

### 3) **Older adults with mental health and psychological problems (specific target subgroup)**
**Extracted scope language:**
- “Patients **with and without… mental health and psychological problems were included**.”
- Aims/objectives: “Determine if changes in pain assessment strategy are required for people with **cognitive impairment, mental health or psychological problems**.”
- Section framing: “**Pain assessment of older adults with mental health and psychological problems**.”

**Significant details:**
- Focuses on older adults where pain assessment is affected by **depression, anxiety, psychological distress**, and related factors.
- Notes associations between **pain and depressed mood**, and that **loneliness/social isolation** are associated with increased pain risk; highlights that **communication difficulty + depression** can increase reported pain scores.

### 4) **Older adults with communication difficulties / sensory impairment (cross-cutting target subgroup)**
**Extracted scope language:**
- Executive summary: assessment is “hampered by many communication issues, including **cognitive ability and socio-cultural factors**.”
- Communication section: in “advanced age, with **cognitive impairments or from different cultural backgrounds**, the process of communication… becomes even more complex.”
- UK guideline excerpt within the document: “facilitate communication particularly with those people with **sensory impairments** (hearing aids and glasses for example).”

**Significant details:**
- Includes older adults who have difficulty communicating pain due to **hearing/vision impairment**, **speech difficulties**, **cognitive impairment**, and **cultural/linguistic factors**.
- Reinforces adapting tools (e.g., **accessible formats**, alternative descriptors like “sore/aching/discomfort,” allowing extra time to respond).

## Practical “who this guideline applies to” (consolidated)
**Adult older people (primarily ≥65; search included ≥60) experiencing acute or chronic pain (malignant or non-malignant), in any care setting (hospital, geriatric facilities, community, residential/nursing homes), including those with cognitive impairment/dementia, mental health/psychological problems, and/or communication/sensory barriers.**",painmg,target_population_extraction
PMC5888957.txt,"This document is a **pain assessment guideline for “older people”** and it does **not** set out a classic “do not use in X patients” exclusion list the way a drug guideline might. Instead, its scope (and therefore practical exclusions) comes from the **population and settings it was written for**, plus the **limits of the evidence it reviewed**.

Below are the clearest “exclusion criteria” you can infer from the guideline text you provided—i.e., **who it is not intended for / when it should not be used as the primary guide**.

## 1) People who are not “older” (outside the age range)
- The guideline is written for **older adults**, generally **≥65 years** (the methods section states “over 65 years of age” for included interventions; the search strategy also mentions “over 60,” but the guideline’s target population is clearly older people).
**So it is not intended as the main guideline for:**
- Children and adolescents
- Working-age adults (e.g., <60–65)

## 2) Non-human / non-patient contexts
The evidence base and recommendations are for **adult humans in clinical/care settings**.
**So it does not apply to:**
- Animal/veterinary pain assessment
- Non-clinical research contexts where pain is induced/experimentally manipulated (except as evidence sources)

## 3) Situations where the goal is *pain management/treatment* rather than *pain assessment*
This guideline is specifically about **assessment** (tools, communication, observational scales, etc.). It explicitly points to other guidance for management (e.g., “Guidance on the management of pain in older people”).
**So it should not be used as the main guide for:**
- Choosing analgesics/opioids, dosing, titration, deprescribing, etc. (beyond assessment implications)
- Full treatment pathways (pharmacological or non-pharmacological), except insofar as reassessment is needed to evaluate response

## 4) Patient groups not well covered by the included evidence (practical “evidence exclusions”)
The guideline includes older adults **with and without cognitive impairment**, and includes those with **mental health/psychological problems**. However, some groups are not clearly addressed or may require additional specialist guidance because the evidence/tools may not be validated or may behave differently.

Common examples where you should **not rely on this guideline alone**:
- **Severe sensory/communication barriers where even adapted self-report and standard observational tools are unreliable**, e.g.:
  - Profound deafness/blindness without effective aids/support
  - Severe aphasia or severe dysarthria where behavioural cues are atypical
  - Disorders of consciousness / minimally conscious state (not discussed; different assessment frameworks are used)
- **End-of-life/palliative sedation or ICU-level critical illness**, where behavioural pain tools and physiology-based tools differ and are setting-specific (the guideline mentions palliative settings in the literature, but it is not an ICU/ventilated-patient tool guideline).
- **Acute peri-operative/anaesthesia recovery protocols** where specialty tools and monitoring standards apply (again, some evidence exists, but this guideline is not written as a peri-operative standard).

## 5) People outside the care settings contemplated (limited applicability)
The guideline explicitly considers many settings (acute hospital, geriatric hospitals, community, care homes, long-term care). If you are in a setting with very different constraints/monitoring (e.g., ICU, operating theatre, emergency major trauma), you generally need setting-specific pain assessment standards.
**So it may be inappropriate as the sole guide in:**
- ICU/ventilated patients
- Intra-operative settings
- Major trauma/resuscitation contexts

## 6) “Cannot use” in an absolute sense: essentially none—because it promotes adapting assessment
Importantly, the foreword and executive summary stress the opposite of exclusion:  
- Even if a person cannot self-report, **pain should still be assessed** using **observational/behavioural tools** (e.g., PAINAD, Doloplus-2) and collateral history from carers/family.

So, the guideline’s stance is: **lack of verbal report is not a reason to exclude someone from pain assessment**—it’s a reason to **change the method**.

### If you want, I can turn this into a one-page “Not in scope / use other guidance” box
Tell me what context you’re applying it in (e.g., care home, acute ward, ED, ICU, hospice) and the patient group (e.g., dementia, stroke/aphasia, Parkinson’s, delirium), and I’ll map the practical exclusions and the best alternative toolsets/guidelines.",painmg,exclusion_criteria_extraction
PMC6398030.txt,"## TARGET POPULATION (extracted from the guideline text)

### 1) Primary target population: Patients with Failed Back Surgery Syndrome (FBSS) / Chronic Back and Leg Pain after spinal surgery
**Target population text (verbatim/near-verbatim from the guideline):**
- “patients affected by **new, recurrent, or persistent pain in the low back and/or legs following spinal surgery**.”
- “patients diagnosed with **FBSS**” (as a subcategory of chronic back and leg pain, CBLP).
- The paper focuses on “**recommendations on the management of patients with FBSS** utilizing a multidisciplinary team (MDT) approach,” and specifically on “**selecting appropriate validated tools to improve the FBSS patient assessment**.”

**Significant details that define who is “in” this population (from the guideline’s proposed definition/diagnostic boundary):**
A patient fits the guideline’s FBSS population when all of the following apply:
- **Pain location:** back and/or leg pain.
- **Post-surgical context:** pain occurs **following spinal surgery** (the guideline emphasizes confirming prior spinal surgeries in the history).
- **Duration:** pain “**persists for at least six months following the most recent spinal surgery**.”
- **Assessment completed:** the patient “**has undergone a thorough clinical and radiological assessment**” (and elsewhere the guideline also emphasizes psychosocial assessment as part of the work-up).
- **No concordant surgical lesion:** “**There is no clear surgical target on clinical examination and imaging that is concordant with presenting symptoms**.”
- **Surgery not appropriate by consensus:** “**There is interdisciplinary agreement that additional surgical intervention (decompression and/or fusion) is not appropriate**.”

**Important boundary/implicit exclusions (who falls outside or needs different handling first):**
- The guideline stresses exploring the timing after surgery so that **early post-operative complications within the first 6 months** can be identified and treated promptly, including:
  - “**hardware failure, recurrent herniation, and infection, including discitis and abscess**.”
  - Practically, this implies that patients whose symptoms are due to these treatable early complications (or who are <6 months post-op) are **not yet in the “FBSS as defined here” group** until those issues are addressed and/or the 6-month criterion is met.

---

### 2) Target population for the *care model* described: Clinicians/teams managing FBSS patients (contextual “audience” tied to the patient population)
While not a patient subgroup, the guideline explicitly frames who the recommendations are meant to support:
- “**specialists and nonspecialist clinicians who manage patients with FBSS**”
- and the care is intended to be delivered via a **multidisciplinary team (MDT)**.

This matters because the guideline’s “target population” is operationalized as **FBSS patients managed in an MDT pathway**, not as a single-specialty protocol.

---

## Segmentation by patient subgroups described in the guideline (within the FBSS population)

The document doesn’t define multiple separate “target populations” the way oncology guidelines often do (e.g., by stage), but it *does* repeatedly segment FBSS patients by clinical presentation and assessment domains. Below are the practical sub-populations the guideline text distinguishes.

### A) FBSS patients with predominant leg pain / suspected radicular neuropathic pain
**How the guideline characterizes this subgroup:**
- Under physical examination: “**The Leg Pain Component**… aims to confirm a **radicular lesion** mainly indicative of **neuropathic pain** and to eliminate pain due to another cause.”
- Suggestive findings: “**sensory dysfunction (hypoesthesia, anesthesia, or allodynia)** … and/or **motor deficit**.”

**Assessment tools explicitly linked to this subgroup:**
- Neuropathic pain screening tools: **DN4**, **LANSS**, **S-LANSS**.

---

### B) FBSS patients with predominant back pain (mechanical and/or possible neuropathic component)
**How the guideline characterizes this subgroup:**
- “**The Back Pain Component**” is discussed separately from leg pain.
- The guideline highlights common back-pain generators in FBSS evaluation, including:
  - **Muscle pain** (deconditioning/degeneration, hypoactivity, repeated surgery → instability risk)
  - **Facet joint pain and spinal instability**
  - **Discogenic pain** (described as “deep midline low back pain… mechanical and positional… generally worse when upright rather than supine”)

This subgrouping is used to guide the clinical exam and thinking about pain generators, even though the paper is primarily about assessment rather than treatment selection.

---

### C) FBSS patients requiring psychosocial evaluation as part of the definition-confirming work-up
**How the guideline frames this subgroup/need:**
- The initial MDT evaluation includes “**psychosocial evaluation**.”
- It emphasizes that “**psychological factors affect pain perception**,” coping strategies influence cooperation with management, and social factors contribute to health.
- It proposes a “**minimal psychosocial assessment toolbox**” (the table itself isn’t included in the text you provided, but the requirement for psychosocial assessment is explicit).

This effectively defines a subgroup of FBSS patients where psychosocial factors are relevant to assessment and pathway decisions—presented as a standard component for all, but highlighted as clinically important.

---

### D) FBSS patients needing imaging to exclude a new surgical indication (i.e., not yet “confirmed FBSS” until excluded)
**How the guideline defines this assessment-dependent subgroup:**
- Radiology is “**essential in order to exclude new indications for reoperation**,” including:
  - recurrent disc herniation, instability, imbalance, nonunion, new stenosis, abscess, etc.
- This is a key gatekeeping step before a patient is considered to meet the FBSS definition (“no clear surgical target” + interdisciplinary agreement no further surgery is appropriate).

---

## Consolidated “TARGET POPULATION” statement (ready to paste into a template)

**TARGET POPULATION**  
Patients with chronic back and/or leg pain following spinal surgery consistent with failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS), defined by pain persisting for at least 6 months after the most recent spinal surgery, after thorough clinical, radiological (and psychosocial) assessment, with no concordant surgically remediable lesion on examination/imaging and interdisciplinary agreement that further decompression and/or fusion is not appropriate. The guideline emphasizes MDT-based assessment and includes evaluation of leg-pain/radicular neuropathic features, back-pain generators (muscle, facet/instability, discogenic), psychosocial factors, and imaging to exclude new indications for reoperation or early post-operative complications (e.g., hardware failure, recurrent herniation, infection such as discitis/abscess).

If you upload the PDF or images of the actual guideline pages (instead of pasted text), I can also quote the exact sentences with page/section references.",painmg,target_population_extraction
PMC6398030.txt,"This consensus statement is intended to guide assessment/management **only for patients who truly meet the panel’s definition of “failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS)”**. So the practical “exclusion criteria” are the situations where a patient **should not be labeled FBSS yet** or **should be managed on a different pathway** (e.g., urgent surgical/medical treatment, or a clear indication for reoperation).

Below are the main groups of patients who **cannot use this guideline as an FBSS pathway** (i.e., are excluded from the FBSS category the guideline is built around):

## 1) Too early after the last spine surgery (< 6 months)
The definition requires **pain persisting at least 6 months after the most recent spinal surgery**.  
So patients with new/persistent pain **within the first 6 months** are not “FBSS” under this guideline, because early postoperative problems may still be evolving and may require different evaluation/treatment.

## 2) Patients with a *treatable surgical target* (reoperation indicated)
A core requirement is: **no clear surgical target on exam/imaging that matches symptoms**, and **interdisciplinary agreement that further decompression and/or fusion is not appropriate**.

So patients are excluded if assessment shows a concordant, actionable cause such as (examples explicitly mentioned in the paper’s imaging section):
- **Recurrent disc herniation**
- **New-onset stenosis**
- **Spinal instability** or significant mechanical instability
- **Nonunion/pseudarthrosis** after fusion
- **Spinal imbalance** that is surgically correctable
- **Hardware failure** (also highlighted as an early complication to identify promptly)

If any of these are present *and* match the clinical picture, the patient should be routed to a **surgical/structural problem pathway**, not the FBSS pathway.

## 3) Patients with urgent “red flag” conditions (non-FBSS causes needing immediate work-up)
The guideline stresses screening for “red flags” and specifically calls out conditions that must be identified and treated promptly rather than managed as FBSS, including:
- **Infection** (e.g., discitis, abscess)
- **Neoplasm**
- **Fracture**

These are exclusions because they represent different diagnoses with different priorities and treatments.

## 4) Patients who have not had an adequate multidisciplinary assessment yet
Their FBSS definition requires that the patient:
- has had a **thorough clinical and radiological assessment**, and
- has had appropriate **psychosocial assessment**, and
- there is **interdisciplinary agreement** that more surgery is not appropriate.

So, practically, patients are excluded from *using the FBSS guideline* until they have completed that work-up—because the guideline’s pathway starts with confirming FBSS via MDT evaluation.

## 5) Patients whose pain is better explained by a non-spinal or non–surgery-related diagnosis
The paper emphasizes that leg pain evaluation should “eliminate pain due to another cause.” If symptoms are primarily from another condition (e.g., hip disease, peripheral neuropathy, vascular claudication, etc.), then the FBSS pathway is not the right guideline because the pain generator is not “post–spine surgery chronic back/leg pain without a surgical target.”

---

### In one sentence
Under this consensus statement, you **do not apply the FBSS guideline** to patients who are **<6 months post-op**, have **red flags**, have a **clear surgically correctable cause**, lack a **completed MDT (somatic + imaging + psychosocial) assessment**, or have pain primarily from a **different non-spinal diagnosis**.

If you tell me the patient’s timing since last surgery, main symptoms (back vs leg), and key imaging findings, I can map them to “meets FBSS definition vs excluded and why” using the paper’s criteria.",painmg,exclusion_criteria_extraction

### Primary target population (who the Standards of Care apply to)
- **People with osteoarthritis (OA)**, specifically **peripheral joint OA**:
  - **Hand OA**
  - **Hip OA**
  - **Knee OA**
- The document is written to support **patient-centred standards of care** and includes:
  - a **professional (expert) version** of standards of care, and  
  - a **patient version** written in **lay language** as **checklist questions** intended to help patients discuss care with health professionals.

**Key condition description included in the guideline (population characterization):**
- OA is described as a **highly prevalent, progressive, degenerative joint disorder** leading to:
  - **pain**
  - **stiffness**
  - **disability**
  - **reduced quality of life**
  - **limitations in activities of daily living**
- It is characterized by:
  - **loss of cartilage**
  - **changes in subchondral bone**
  - abnormalities in other joint tissues (e.g., **synovial membrane**, **ligaments**)

### Explicit exclusions / out-of-scope populations
- **OA of the spine is excluded** (and related back-pain/OA-spine guidance was not considered):
  - The working group “**agreed … to develop a SOC for hand, hip and knee OA and to exclude the management of OA of the spine**.”
  - Therefore, **guidelines for management of back pain and/or OA of the spine were not taken into account**.

## Segmentation by “target population” mentioned or implied in the document

### 1) Clinical condition target: People with hand, hip, and/or knee OA
**Applies to:**
- Individuals with OA affecting **hand, hip, knee**, or OA “in general” *as long as it pertains to these peripheral joints*.

**Does not apply to:**
- People whose OA management focus is **spinal OA/back pain** (explicitly excluded).

### 2) Audience target: Patients (patient-facing checklist)
**Applies to:**
- **Patients with OA** who need information and want to confirm they are receiving appropriate care.
- The checklist is intended to:
  - help patients “**clarify if they have all the required information**”
  - serve as a “**basis for the conversation with health professionals**”
  - be understandable for “**lay people**” (wording approved by patient partners)

### 3) Audience target: Health professionals / service providers (professional standards)
**Applies to:**
- **Health professionals** involved in OA care across Europe (the project aims to harmonize standards across different healthcare systems).
- The guideline development involved a multidisciplinary expert panel including:
  - patient research partners
  - health professional experts (e.g., those delivering pharmacological and non-pharmacological care such as physiotherapy/rehabilitation disciplines are explicitly referenced)

## What is *not* specified (important limitation for “target population” extraction)
- The text provided **does not define** target population by:
  - age group (e.g., adults only vs all ages)
  - disease severity thresholds (mild/moderate/severe)
  - diagnostic criteria
  - setting (primary care vs specialty care), beyond general Europe-wide applicability

PMC4431331.txt,"This eumusc.net “Standards of Care (SOC) for osteoarthritis” guideline is **not intended for everyone with joint pain**. Based on the paper’s stated scope and its inclusion/exclusion decisions, the main groups of patients for whom this SOC **should not be used as the applicable guideline** are:

## 1) People whose osteoarthritis is primarily in the spine (back/neck)
- The working group **explicitly excluded OA of the spine**.
- They also excluded guidelines for **back pain and/or spinal OA**.
**So patients whose main problem is cervical/thoracic/lumbar spine OA (or “degenerative disc disease/spondylosis” presenting as back pain)** are outside the intended target.

## 2) People whose OA is not in the hand, hip, or knee (or not “general OA”)
The SOC was developed from guidelines that addressed:
- **Hand OA**
- **Hip OA**
- **Knee OA**
- or **OA in general**

Therefore, patients with OA mainly affecting other peripheral joints (e.g., **shoulder, elbow, ankle, foot, temporomandibular joint**) are not the core population the SOC was built for. The SOC may still contain broadly sensible principles, but it is **not specifically derived/validated for those joints**.

## 3) People whose condition is not osteoarthritis (even if symptoms look similar)
The SOC is for **OA**, not for other causes of joint pain/disability, such as:
- **Inflammatory arthritis** (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, gout)
- **Septic arthritis**
- **Periarticular/tendon disorders** as the primary diagnosis
- **Non-specific back pain** (explicitly separated from peripheral OA in the paper)

In practice: if the diagnosis is uncertain or another disease is driving symptoms, this SOC is not the right guide.

## 4) Practical “non-applicability” due to the evidence base used (European guideline basis)
This is not a patient-level medical contraindication, but it affects who the guideline is meant to serve:
- The SOC was derived **only from European guidelines** (full text available) and intended to harmonize care **within Europe**.
So it is **not designed as a standard for non-European healthcare systems** (where professional roles, access pathways, and service structures differ).

## 5) What the paper does *not* list as exclusions (important clarification)
The article does **not** specify patient exclusions such as:
- age limits (e.g., older vs younger adults),
- pregnancy,
- comorbidity-based exclusions (renal disease, GI bleeding risk, etc.),
- severity-based exclusions.

Instead, those kinds of limitations are typically handled **within individual treatment recommendations** (e.g., medication contraindications), not by excluding the patient from the SOC entirely.

- Pain is often **co-occurring** with:
  - **Fatigue**
  - **Cognitive disturbances**
- The guideline notes that reporting persistent pain in surveys is **not automatically equivalent to functional impairment**, but it flags that **relevant impairments (e.g., ongoing inability to work)** can occur (reported “bei bis zu 10 % … sieben Monate …” in the excerpt).

**Significant details (how these subgroups are defined):**
- **Suspected inflammatory-rheumatic disease** → rheumatology evaluation.
- **Suspected neuropathic pain** (including possible **small-fiber neuropathy**) → neurology evaluation.

- **No prior SARS‑CoV‑2 infection** (no clinical history compatible with COVID-19 and no evidence of infection), and symptoms are better explained otherwise.
- Symptoms that **clearly predate** the infection and show **no relevant change** afterwards (then it is not “new/persisting post‑infectious symptomatology,” but a pre-existing condition).

## 2) Patients whose symptoms are better explained by an alternative diagnosis (core WHO requirement)
The text explicitly highlights the WHO definition: Post‑COVID symptoms must **not be explainable by alternative diagnoses or pre-existing diseases**. Therefore, the guideline should *not* be used as the main framework if the patient’s pain is primarily due to, for example:
- **Inflammatory rheumatologic disease** (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis flare, vasculitis) as the main driver
- **Structural/orthopedic causes** (e.g., fracture, severe spinal stenosis with clear radiculopathy, acute disc herniation with red flags)
- **Primary headache disorders** that fully explain the presentation (migraine, tension-type headache, cluster headache) *without* a meaningful post-infectious change—these should be treated primarily under the **specific headache guidelines**
- **Neurologic disorders** explaining neuropathic pain (e.g., diabetic polyneuropathy, entrapment neuropathy) unless there is a justified post-COVID contribution that remains after workup
- **Other medical causes** of generalized pain/fatigue (e.g., untreated hypothyroidism, severe anemia, active malignancy, infection) when these explain the symptoms

In short: if another diagnosis explains the symptoms, the patient should be treated under the **relevant disease-specific pathway**, not labeled/managed primarily as Long/Post‑COVID.

## 3) Patients still in the acute/subacute phase (timing mismatch)
The guideline emphasizes specialist evaluation when symptoms **persist longer than 3 months** after infection. So it is generally **not a Long/Post‑COVID case** if:
- Symptoms are only present **within the first weeks** after acute COVID (this is more “post-acute COVID”/convalescence, not Long/Post‑COVID in the stricter sense).

## 4) ICU survivors with critical-illness neuropathy/myopathy as the primary problem (separate entity)
The text explicitly states that in patients treated in intensive care, **Critical-illness polyneuropathy/myopathy (CIP/CIM)** must be differentiated, and these patients require **specialized rehabilitation care**. Practically, this means:
- If the main limitation/pain/weakness pattern is consistent with **CIP/CIM**, management should follow **ICU-aftercare/rehabilitation and neurology/rehab pathways**, not the general Long/Post‑COVID pain approach.

## 5) Patients with “red flags” / potentially dangerous courses needing urgent workup
The supplement on headache states that **neurologic abnormalities or very severe symptoms** require specialized diagnostics. More broadly, the guideline repeatedly stresses ruling out “abwendbar gefährliche Verläufe” (preventable dangerous courses). So the guideline should not be used as a stand-alone approach when there are warning signs such as:
- New focal neurologic deficits, altered consciousness, meningism
- Thunderclap headache, signs of raised intracranial pressure
- Chest pain with cardiopulmonary warning features
- Systemic inflammatory signs, unexplained weight loss, suspected thrombosis/embolism, etc.

These patients need **urgent differential diagnosis first**; only afterwards can a Long/Post‑COVID framework be considered.

## 6) Patients whose main need is a different established chronic pain diagnosis pathway
If the clinical picture is best classified as an established chronic pain condition (e.g., **fibromyalgia syndrome**, chronic migraine, neuropathic pain syndrome) and COVID is not a necessary explanatory factor, then treatment should primarily follow the **corresponding AWMF pain guidelines** (which the document itself recommends using).

### Practical one-sentence rule
A patient should *not* be managed under this Long/Post‑COVID guideline **as the primary framework** if their symptoms are **(a)** not temporally linked to SARS‑CoV‑2, **(b)** better explained by another diagnosis (including CIP/CIM after ICU), or **(c)** show red flags requiring urgent/specialist workup.

If you tell me the patient group you mean (e.g., ICU survivors, children/adolescents, people without PCR confirmation, pre-existing chronic pain), I can translate the above into a concrete “include/exclude” checklist for that setting.",painmg,exclusion_criteria_extraction
PMC11621171.txt,"## TARGET POPULATION (overall scope of the guideline)
**Adult inpatients with suspected or confirmed nosocomial pneumonia (hospital-acquired pneumonia, including ventilator-associated pneumonia).**  
- The guideline is intended for **physicians involved in the inpatient care of adult patients with nosocomial pneumonia**.  
- It focuses on **German epidemiology and standards of care** and provides evidence-based recommendations on **diagnosis and treatment** of nosocomial pneumonia in Germany.

---

## TARGET POPULATION SEGMENT 1: Adults with nosocomial pneumonia—stratified by MDRP / *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* risk
The guideline repeatedly defines a key management split for the **initial empiric approach**:

### Population A: Patients **without** risk factors for multidrug-resistant pathogens (MDRP) and/or *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*
- Adults with nosocomial pneumonia **who do not have increased risk** for MDRP/*P. aeruginosa*.
- Empiric therapy suggestions in this group include:
  - **Aminopenicillins + beta-lactamase inhibitor**, or  
  - **3a cephalosporins** (specifically **ceftriaxone** or **cefotaxime**).

### Population B: Patients **with** risk factors for MDRP and/or *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*
- Adults with nosocomial pneumonia **with increased risk** for MDRP/*P. aeruginosa* (risk factors referenced as being listed in a table in the full guideline).
- Empiric therapy suggestions in this group include:
  - **Piperacillin/tazobactam**, **cefepime**, or **meropenem**.
- The guideline emphasizes that empiric choices should be based on:
  - **Local ward/facility pathogen spectrum and resistance data**, which should be **recorded and presented every 6–12 months**.

---

## TARGET POPULATION SEGMENT 2: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) patients—diagnostic sampling approach
**Adults with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)** are explicitly addressed for diagnostic strategy:

- The guideline states that **bronchoscopic microbiological sampling is not superior to non-bronchoscopic sampling** in VAP for key outcomes (mortality, adequacy of therapy, antibiotic days, ventilator days).
- Therefore, the target population here is:
  - **Adult ICU patients with suspected VAP**, where the decision to use bronchoscopy should depend on **local logistics**, **differential diagnostic needs**, and **potential therapeutic aspects** of endoscopy.

---

## TARGET POPULATION SEGMENT 3: ICU patients with nosocomial pneumonia at risk for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA)
A distinct subgroup is defined for fungal/Aspergillus diagnostics:

**Adults on the ICU with nosocomial pneumonia who have risk factors for IPA**, even **without classic severe immunosuppression (e.g., neutropenia)**, **if IPA is suspected**.

Examples of IPA risk factors explicitly listed:
- **Steroid therapy**
- **COPD**
- **Liver cirrhosis**
- **Malnutrition**
- **Burns**
- **Diabetes**
- **Severe influenza or COVID-19 infection**

Recommended diagnostic minimum in this population:
- At least one **galactomannan antigen test** from **bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)** (ODI cutoff **≥ 1.0**), plus additional microbiology if needed.

---

## TARGET POPULATION SEGMENT 4: Patients with septic shock (combination therapy subgroup)
The guideline narrows empiric combination therapy to a very specific target group:

**Adults with nosocomial pneumonia who have:**
1) **Septic shock**, **AND**  
2) **At least one additional risk factor for MDRP**.

Additional refinement:
- If septic shock + increased risk of *P. aeruginosa*, then **Pseudomonas-effective combination therapy** is recommended **until susceptibility results are available**.

---

## TARGET POPULATION SEGMENT 5: Critically ill patients (beta-lactam administration strategy)
**Critically ill adults with nosocomial pneumonia** are singled out for dosing/administration strategy:

- The guideline suggests **prolonged infusion** (after an initial loading dose) of suitable **beta-lactam antibiotics** in **critically ill patients**.

---

## TARGET POPULATION SEGMENT 6: Patients considered for inhaled antibiotics (restricted subgroup)
The guideline defines a narrow population where inhaled therapy may be considered:

- **Not recommended routinely** for all adults with nosocomial pneumonia.
- **May be considered** in adults with nosocomial pneumonia where:
  - There are **multi-resistant Gram-negative pathogens** that are **only sensitive to colistin and/or aminoglycosides**,
  - As **adjunct** to systemic therapy, using suitable nebulizers.

---

## TARGET POPULATION SEGMENT 7: Patients eligible for de-escalation/focused therapy
This is framed as applicable broadly to adults with nosocomial pneumonia receiving antibiotics:

- **Adults with clinical treatment response**, even **without pathogen detection** → de-escalation recommended.
- **Adults with microbiological evidence of a relevant pathogen** → therapy should be **focused** (narrowed/targeted).

---

## TARGET POPULATION SEGMENT 8: Patients for whom 7–8 day duration applies (and exceptions)
**Adults with nosocomial pneumonia who respond well to therapy**:
- Suggested antibiotic duration: **7–8 days**.

Explicit exception examples where longer duration may be needed:
- **S. aureus bacteremia**
- **Non-remediable empyema**
- **Abscess**
- Also noted for individualized decisions: **severe ARDS and/or septic shock**, **structural lung disease (e.g., bronchiectasis)**, **lung abscess/empyema**.

PMC11621171.txt,"This German AWMF S3 guideline (update 2024) is **explicitly written for adult inpatients with nosocomial pneumonia (HAP/VAP)** in the German care setting. Patients **outside that scope** should not be managed “by this guideline alone” (or the recommendations may not apply).

## 1) Patients the guideline is not intended for (scope exclusions)
### A. Children/adolescents
- **All patients <18 years** (the guideline is for *adults*).

### B. Community-acquired or non-nosocomial pneumonias
Not covered if the pneumonia is:
- **Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP)** (onset before admission or very early after admission without nosocomial context).
- **Aspiration pneumonitis** without established bacterial pneumonia (chemical injury after aspiration; management differs).
- **Viral pneumonia as primary diagnosis** (e.g., influenza/COVID without bacterial superinfection), except that the guideline highlights ICU patients with severe influenza/COVID as a *risk group for IPA diagnostics*—but it is still a *nosocomial pneumonia* guideline.

### C. Outpatients / non-inpatient settings
- Not designed for **ambulatory/outpatient** management.

### D. Non-pulmonary infections
- Not applicable if the main problem is **non-respiratory infection** (e.g., isolated bloodstream infection, UTI) without nosocomial pneumonia.

## 2) Patient groups where key recommendations may not be applicable or need major modification
These are not always stated as “exclusions,” but the guideline itself signals that evidence is limited or that decisions must be individualized—so you should not apply the standard pathway uncritically.

### A. Profoundly immunocompromised patients (special populations)
The document discusses Aspergillus diagnostics even **without** classic severe immunosuppression, but it does **not** function as a full guideline for:
- **Neutropenia**, hematologic malignancy, stem-cell transplant
- **Solid organ transplant**
- Other **severe immunosuppression** where pathogen spectrum, diagnostics, and empiric therapy differ substantially  
(These patients often require dedicated immunocompromised-host pneumonia guidance.)

### B. Structural lung disease / complicated pulmonary infection (therapy duration recommendations don’t apply)
The guideline’s **7–8 day** duration suggestion is based on trials that **regularly excluded**:
- **Bronchiectasis / significant structural lung disease**
- **Lung abscess**
- **Empyema** (especially if not drainable / “non-remediable”)
It also states longer/individualized courses may be needed for:
- **Severe ARDS and/or septic shock** (individualize)
- **S. aureus bacteremia** with pneumonia (treated as complicated SAB; typically much longer therapy)

### C. Patients not fitting HAP/VAP definitions used in the evidence base
Some recommendations are derived mainly from **VAP/ICU** studies; applicability is weaker in:
- **Non-ventilated HAP** (the guideline itself notes limited data and heterogeneity)
- Settings where local microbiology/resistance patterns differ markedly from those assumed (the guideline stresses using **local antibiograms**)

## 3) Practical “cannot use as-is” situations (method/evidence limitations)
Even within adult HAP/VAP, the guideline should not be used as a rigid protocol when:
- **Local resistance epidemiology is unknown** (the guideline requires ward/facility data updated every 6–12 months to guide empiric choices).
- You need management decisions for entities the guideline does not cover in depth (e.g., **TB, NTM**, endemic fungi, noninfectious mimics), where separate diagnostic/treatment pathways are required.

## Bottom line
You should **not use this guideline** for **pediatric patients**, **CAP**, **outpatients**, or **non-pneumonia infections**. You should also **not apply key recommendations unchanged** (especially empiric regimens and **7–8 day duration**) in **profound immunosuppression**, **bronchiectasis/abscess/empyema**, **bacteremic S. aureus pneumonia**, or other **complicated/severe** scenarios where the guideline itself indicates individualized management or where the underlying evidence excluded those patients.

PMC7082664.txt,"## TARGET POPULATION (extracted from the guideline text)

This guideline is written for **patients undergoing transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy (TRUS-Bx)**, primarily in the context of **preoperative diagnosis of prostate cancer**.

**Exact/near-exact population wording from the document**
- “**Transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy (TRUS-Bx) is a standard test for the preoperative diagnosis of prostate cancer** and is currently performed widely by radiologists and urologists.”
- The guideline presents recommendations “**for patient preparation, standard technique, and biopsy-related pain management during TRUS-Bx**.”

Because the document is a *procedure-focused consensus statement*, it does **not** define a single narrow disease-stage population (e.g., “stage X cancer”) the way oncology treatment guidelines often do. Instead, the implied target population is **any patient for whom TRUS-Bx is planned/performed**.

---

## Segmented target populations within the guideline (with significant details)

### 1) Core target population: Patients scheduled for TRUS-Bx
**Who this includes**
- Patients undergoing **TRUS-guided prostate biopsy** as part of evaluation/diagnosis for suspected prostate cancer (the guideline frames TRUS-Bx as a diagnostic standard test).

**What the guideline covers for them**
- **Patient preparation** (anticoagulant/antiplatelet management, enema, antibiotics)
- **Biopsy-related pain management** (PNB, intrarectal lidocaine gel, limited opioid use)
- **Standard biopsy technique choices** (core number scheme; needle considerations)

---

### 2) Subpopulation: Patients taking anticoagulants and/or antiplatelet agents (peri-procedure bleeding risk)
**How the guideline identifies this group**
- Discusses “**Anticoagulation: Stop or Continue before Biopsy?**”
- Notes bleeding is common after TRUS-Bx (hematuria/rectal bleeding/hematospermia).

**Key population-specific details (as stated in recommendations)**
- “**Before TRUS-Bx, anticoagulants and anti-platelet agents should be discontinued at least 5 days prior to the procedure**…”
- Coagulation parameters should be “**monitored and adjusted**” to:
  - **PT-INR < 1.5**
  - **Platelet count > 50,000/µL**

(These thresholds effectively define a procedural-safety target for this subpopulation.)

---

### 3) Subpopulation: Patients considered for bowel preparation (rectal enema)
**How the guideline frames this group**
- Patients undergoing TRUS-Bx where stool in the rectum may impair imaging or potentially affect infection risk.

**Key population-specific details**
- The guideline states there is “**no strong evidence to recommend for or against**” enema use, but it **can be administered**:
  - to “**improve the sonic window**”
  - or “**to lower the potential infectious biopsy risk**”
- It also states: “**The standard bowel preparation method should be rectal enema.**”

---

### 4) Subpopulation: Patients at risk of post-biopsy infection (antimicrobial prophylaxis candidates)
**How the guideline identifies this group**
- Patients undergoing TRUS-Bx (procedure-associated bacteriuria/bacteremia/clinical infection risk).

**Key population-specific details**
- “**Antimicrobial prophylaxis is recommended to reduce the risk of postbiopsy infectious complications.**”
- Post-biopsy antibiotic duration is described as controversial; KSUR members “**typically use a course of 5 days or less after biopsy**.”

---

### 5) Subpopulation: Patients requiring pain control during TRUS-Bx
The guideline breaks this into pain-control approaches, which effectively define subgroups based on what analgesia/anesthesia is used or needed.

#### 5a) Patients receiving periprostatic neurovascular bundle block (PNB)
**Key population-specific details**
- “**PNB is highly recommended to lower patient discomfort associated with TRUS-Bx.**”
- Describes typical technique details (e.g., lidocaine volume/concentration and injection region), indicating this is intended for routine TRUS-Bx patients where pain reduction is desired.

#### 5b) Patients receiving intrarectal lidocaine gel application (IRLA)
**Key population-specific details**
- “**IRLA can be used as an ancillary method** to decrease discomfort…”
- “**In particular, IRLA is recommended to be used in combination with PNB.**”

#### 5c) Patients considered for opioid analogues (selected cases; anxiolysis adjunct)
**Key population-specific details**
- “**Opioids… are not usually recommended for pain relief during biopsy.**”
- “**However, the use of opioids can be considered for anxiolysis.**”
- Notes consensus was not fully achieved (so this is a narrower/less standard subgroup).

---

### 6) Subpopulation: Patients undergoing systematic sampling (biopsy core scheme / needle considerations)
**How the guideline frames this group**
- Patients undergoing TRUS-Bx where diagnostic yield and sampling adequacy are priorities.

**Key population-specific details**
- Recommends “**a 12-core biopsy scheme that incorporates apical and far-lateral cores**” as optimal for detection-related outcomes.
- Notes needle gauge/throw are less important for cancer detection rate, but specimen length matters:
  - “**11.9 mm or more is suggested**” for biopsy specimen length.

---

## Consolidated “TARGET POPULATION” statement (usable as a guideline header)
**TARGET POPULATION:**  
Patients undergoing **transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy (TRUS-Bx)** for diagnostic evaluation (preoperative diagnosis) of suspected prostate cancer. The guideline also provides specific procedural recommendations for key TRUS-Bx subgroups, including patients on **anticoagulant/antiplatelet therapy**, those receiving **bowel preparation**, those requiring **antimicrobial prophylaxis**, and those needing **pain/anxiety management** (PNB ± intrarectal lidocaine gel; opioids only selectively for anxiolysis), as well as patients undergoing **systematic core sampling** (recommended 12-core scheme).",painmg,target_population_extraction
PMC7082664.txt,"This KSUR document is a **technical/operational guideline for how to perform TRUS-guided prostate biopsy**, not a “who should get a biopsy” indication guideline. It therefore does **not** provide a single, explicit “exclusion criteria” list. However, it *does* state (or strongly imply) several situations in which a patient **should not undergo TRUS-Bx under this guideline as written**—either because key safety prerequisites are not met or because required preparatory steps cannot be followed.

Below are the practical exclusion/“do not proceed” categories that follow directly from the consensus statements.

---

## 1) Patients who cannot safely stop anticoagulants/antiplatelets or cannot meet coagulation targets
The guideline recommends stopping anticoagulants/antiplatelets **≥ 5 days** before TRUS-Bx and ensuring:

- **PT-INR < 1.5**
- **Platelet count > 50,000/µL**

So, patients are effectively **not eligible to proceed under this protocol** if any of the following apply:

- They **cannot discontinue** anticoagulants/antiplatelet agents for the required period because thromboembolic risk is too high (e.g., clinician judges interruption unsafe).
- Their coagulation status **cannot be corrected** to the recommended thresholds (e.g., persistently elevated INR, severe thrombocytopenia).
- They have an uncorrected bleeding diathesis that prevents achieving those targets.

*Practical meaning:* If you cannot stop/adjust these drugs or cannot reach INR/platelet thresholds, the guideline’s standard TRUS-Bx pathway should not be used; an alternative plan (delay, correction, different biopsy approach, specialist input) is needed.

---

## 2) Patients in whom antibiotic prophylaxis cannot be given appropriately
The guideline states that **antimicrobial prophylaxis is recommended** to reduce post-biopsy infectious complications (Grade A).

Therefore, patients may be **poor candidates for TRUS-Bx under this guideline** if:

- They have **contraindications to available prophylactic antibiotics** (e.g., severe allergy patterns leaving no acceptable option), *and* no safe alternative regimen is available.
- There is a situation where prophylaxis cannot be administered as required by local protocol (logistical/clinical constraints).

*Note:* The guideline does not specify a single mandatory antibiotic; it emphasizes prophylaxis in general. So “exclusion” here is mainly when **no safe/effective prophylaxis can be arranged**.

---

## 3) Patients who cannot undergo the recommended local anesthesia approach (PNB ± IRLA)
The guideline recommends **periprostatic neurovascular bundle block (PNB)** strongly, with **intrarectal lidocaine gel (IRLA)** as an adjunct.

Patients may not fit the guideline’s pain-management pathway if they have:

- **Allergy or contraindication to lidocaine/local anesthetics** (relevant to PNB and/or IRLA).
- Other clinical factors making local anesthetic injection inappropriate in the operator’s judgment.

This is not framed as a formal “exclusion,” but it means the guideline’s **standard pain-control protocol cannot be applied** as intended.

---

## 4) Patients in whom rectal enema/bowel preparation cannot be performed when needed
The guideline says evidence is not strong for/against enema, but recommends rectal enema as the standard bowel prep method and notes it can help the sonic window and potentially infection risk.

A patient is not automatically excluded if they cannot tolerate an enema (since evidence is not definitive), but if inability to clear the rectum leads to:

- **Inadequate sonic window** (poor visualization), or
- Operator concern about **procedure quality/safety**,

then TRUS-Bx may need to be deferred or modified.

---

## 5) Important “not covered” populations (outside the scope of this guideline)
Even if not explicitly excluded, the document is written for typical TRUS-Bx practice and does **not** provide tailored recommendations for certain higher-risk/special populations. In such cases, using the guideline *alone* may be inappropriate without additional disease-specific guidance, for example:

- Patients with complex anticoagulation needs (e.g., bridging decisions)
- Patients with unusual infection-risk scenarios requiring specialized prophylaxis strategies

(These are “out of scope” rather than explicitly prohibited.)

---

# Bottom line (who “cannot use” this guideline in practice)
A patient should generally **not proceed with TRUS-Bx using this KSUR standard protocol** if the team cannot ensure at least these prerequisites:

1) **Anticoagulants/antiplatelets can be held ≥5 days** *and* **INR < 1.5** and **platelets > 50,000/µL** can be achieved.  
2) **Antibiotic prophylaxis can be safely administered.**  
3) **Local anesthesia plan (PNB ± IRLA) is feasible** (or an acceptable alternative is in place).

If you tell me the patient’s meds (anticoagulant/antiplatelet type), INR/platelets, allergy history, and infection risk factors, I can map them to these criteria more concretely.",painmg,exclusion_criteria_extraction
PMC4712230.txt,"## TARGET POPULATION (extracted from the guideline text)

This guideline does **not** present a single, explicit “Target population” section in the way many oncology/primary-care guidelines do. However, the **target populations are stated implicitly and repeatedly** across the abstract, methods, and topic sections. Below are the **target population statements as written (or tightly paraphrased only where the guideline uses scattered phrasing)**, segmented by the main populations the recommendations apply to.

---

## 1) Primary target population (overall guideline)

### Extracted target population text (key statements)
- The guideline covers: **“positioning therapy and early mobilization for prophylaxis and therapy of pulmonary function disorders”**.
- Literature focus: **“The focus was on publications involving adult patients.”**
- Setting/population emphasis: search terms and scope include **“ventilated patients, intensive care patients… intensive care unit (ICU)”** and pulmonary disorders including **ARDS/acute lung injury/acute respiratory failure/postoperative respiratory failure**, etc.
- Early mobilisation definition is ICU-based: **“Early mobilisation refers to the beginning of mobilisation within 72 h after admittance to intensive care.”**
- Broad applicability statement: **“In principle, early mobilisation should be conducted in all patients treated in intensive care, for whom no exclusion criteria apply.”** (►37)

### Significant details (what this means as a target population)
- **Adults** (primary evidence base and intended population).
- **Critically ill / ICU patients**, including those:
  - **mechanically ventilated** (invasive ventilation emphasized throughout positioning sections)
  - with or at risk of **pulmonary function disorders** (prevention and treatment)
- Includes both **prophylaxis** (prevention of pulmonary complications like VAP/atelectasis) and **therapy** (improving oxygenation/gas exchange in established respiratory failure/ARDS).

---

## 2) ARDS patients (prone positioning focus)

### Extracted target population text (key statements)
- Recommendation explicitly names: **“Patients with ARDS and an impairment of arterial oxygenation (PaO2/FIO2 < 150)”** (►1)
- ARDS references are aligned to the **Berlin definition** (explicitly stated in “Guideline topics”).

### Significant details
- **Adult ARDS patients**, especially with **moderate–severe oxygenation impairment**:
  - **PaO2/FIO2 < 150** is the key threshold used for strong prone-position recommendation.
- Typically **mechanically ventilated** (the prone positioning evidence and recommendations are framed around ventilated ARDS).

---

## 3) Ventilated ICU patients at risk of VAP/aspiration (backrest elevation)

### Extracted target population text (key statements)
- **“The preferred principle position for intubated patients is the backrest elevation position of 20°–45°, preferably ≥ 30°…”** (►23)
- The evidence described is in **“patients with orotracheal intubation”** and framed around **nosocomial pneumonia/VAP** risk via reflux/aspiration.

### Significant details
- **Intubated (orotracheally intubated) ICU patients**, often with:
  - nasogastric tubes, possible enteral feeding (described in evidence summary)
- Goal: reduce **gastroesophageal reflux** and **pulmonary aspiration**, thereby reducing **VAP risk**.

---

## 4) Ventilated patients with unilateral lung disease (lateral positioning)

### Extracted target population text (key statements)
- **“In the case of ventilation of patients with unilateral lung damage, a lateral position of approximately 90° is recommended with the good lung down to improve the gas exchange.”** (►22)

### Significant details
- **Mechanically ventilated** patients with **unilateral lung pathology** (e.g., one lung “good,” one “bad”).
- Positioning is used **therapeutically** to improve oxygenation (good lung dependent).

---

## 5) Ventilated patients considered for CLRT (continuous lateral rotation therapy)

### Extracted target population text (key statements)
- CLRT is discussed for **“ventilated patients”** with goals including prevention of **atelectasis, pneumonia**, secretion congestion, and improving gas exchange.
- **“The early use of CLRT can be employed in certain groups of ventilated patients as a supplement to prevention of ventilator-associated pneumonia…”** (►14)
- Explicit exclusion: **“CLRT should not be used in patients with ARDS (PaO2/FIO2 < 150)”** (►15)
- Contraindications include: **“An instable spine, acute shock syndrome and a body weight > 159 kg…”**

### Significant details
- **Mechanically ventilated ICU patients** where CLRT is being considered:
  - possibly for **VAP prevention** (as a supplement, not replacing other measures)
  - possibly for **oxygenation improvement** when prone is contraindicated (►15 allows consideration)
- **Not intended** for **severe ARDS (PaO2/FIO2 < 150)** as a treatment substitute for prone.

---

## 6) ICU patients targeted for early mobilisation

### Extracted target population text (key statements)
- Definition: **“Early mobilisation refers to the beginning of mobilisation within 72 h after admittance to intensive care.”**
- Broad recommendation: **“In principle, early mobilisation should be conducted in all patients treated in intensive care, for whom no exclusion criteria apply.”** (►37)
- Patient suitability requirements (►38) include:
  - symptom control (pain/fear/agitation/delirium; score-controlled e.g., RASS)
  - **sufficient respiratory reserve**
  - **sufficient cardiovascular reserve** with reference points (MAP, SBP, HR, SaO2, vasopressor dose)
- Relative contraindication examples (►39): **increased intracranial pressure, active bleeding, acute myocardial ischaemia, agitated delirium**

### Significant details
- **All ICU patients** are the default target for early mobilisation **unless unstable or excluded**.
- Applies to both **ventilated and non-ventilated** ICU patients (monitoring guidance includes ventilated-specific parameters).
- Mobilisation is framed as an **interdisciplinary ICU intervention** with safety thresholds and stop criteria.

---

## 7) Special subpopulations explicitly called out (risk/contraindication groups)

These are not “target populations” for receiving the intervention, but the guideline repeatedly identifies them as **important subgroups** where recommendations change.

### a) Patients with acute cerebral lesions / increased intracranial pressure
- Prone positioning: **“The indication… may only be issued after individual consideration of benefit… and risk (intracranial pressure increase)”** (►8) and **ICP should be continuously monitored** (►9).
- Backrest elevation: **15°–30°** is sensible for increased ICP (►27); **45° cannot be recommended without limitation** when increased ICP is suspected (►28).

### b) Patients with severe obesity
- **“The flat supine position should be avoided in patients with severe obesity”** (►26) and **flat supine position can be dangerous particularly for obese patients** (descriptive text).
- Trendelenburg: **“should principally be avoided in obese patients”** (►36).
- Backrest elevation >45° may help mechanics in ventilated patients with **BMI > 35** (►26).

### c) Patients with abdominal disease / abdominal obesity (positioning cautions)
- Prone: in abdominal obesity, monitor kidney/liver function during prolonged prone (►7).
- Backrest elevation: in abdominal disease or severe obesity, prefer **anti-Trendelenburg without hip flexion** (►32).

### d) Hemodynamically unstable / shock / arrhythmias / spine instability / open abdomen
- Prone contraindications include: **open abdomen, spinal instability, increased ICP, critical arrhythmias, manifest shock** (►13).
- CLRT contraindications include: **instable spine, acute shock syndrome**, and **weight >159 kg**.

---

## Consolidated “Target population” statement (faithful to the guideline’s scope)

**Adult ICU patients—particularly mechanically ventilated patients—with or at risk of pulmonary function disorders (including ARDS, acute respiratory failure, postoperative respiratory failure, atelectasis, and risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia), for whom positioning strategies (prone, lateral, backrest elevation, CLRT) and/or early mobilisation (initiated within 72 hours of ICU admission) are being considered for prophylaxis or therapy, with modifications/contraindications in specific subgroups (e.g., increased intracranial pressure/acute cerebral lesions, shock/hemodynamic instability, spinal instability, open abdomen, severe obesity).**

It is written mainly for **adult ICU patients** and repeatedly states that measures must be **individualized** and **stopped/modified** if risks outweigh benefits. “Exclusion criteria” therefore come from (1) the **scope of the guideline** (who it was developed for) and (2) **explicit contraindications / relative contraindications** for specific interventions (prone positioning, CLRT, backrest elevation, early mobilisation).

Below is a structured list of **which patients cannot use the guideline (or cannot receive key parts of it)**.

---

## 1) Patients outside the intended population (scope exclusions)

### A. Children / paediatric patients
- The evidence base and recommendations focus on **adults**.
- Paediatric studies were largely excluded; paediatric content was only used if it allowed **general, age-independent conclusions**.
**Implication:** The guideline is **not intended to guide routine care in children**.

### B. Non-human / experimental contexts
- Animal studies were not used for recommendations except for limited pathophysiology.
**Implication:** Not applicable outside human clinical care.

### C. Situations not matching the guideline’s clinical setting
- The guideline is primarily aimed at **critically ill / ventilated / ICU** contexts (positioning therapy and early mobilisation in ICU care).
**Implication:** Use in other settings (e.g., outpatient rehab, stable ward patients) is not the primary target and may not translate directly.

---

## 2) Patients who cannot undergo **prone positioning** (explicit contraindications)

The guideline lists the following as **contraindications** to prone positioning (Recommendation ►13). These patients generally **should not be proned**:

1. **Open abdomen** (“open abdomen situation”)
2. **Spinal instability**
3. **Increased intracranial pressure (ICP)** (i.e., acute cerebral lesion with ICP increase)
4. **Critical cardiac rhythm disorders**
5. **Manifest shock / acute shock syndrome**

**Important nuance in the guideline:**  
It explicitly says these contraindications **may be deviated from in individual cases** after a **benefit–risk assessment** and consultation with relevant specialties (recommendation grade 0 / expert consensus). So they function as **strong exclusion criteria in routine practice**, but not as absolute “never” rules.

### Additional “high-risk” groups where prone positioning is restricted
- **Acute cerebral lesions:** prone positioning only after individual benefit–risk consideration (►8) and with **continuous ICP monitoring** (►9).
- **Abdominal obesity / abdominal disease:** not an absolute contraindication, but the guideline warns to monitor **kidney and liver function** closely during prolonged proning in abdominal obesity (►7). For **acute abdominal disease**, it states **no recommendation** can be made due to lack of evidence.

---

## 3) Patients who cannot undergo **continuous lateral rotation therapy (CLRT)**

### A. Explicit contraindications for CLRT
The guideline lists:
1. **Unstable spine**
2. **Acute shock syndrome**
3. **Body weight > 159 kg** (manufacturer limit)

### B. “Do not use” recommendation in severe ARDS
- ►15: **CLRT should not be used in ARDS with PaO₂/FiO₂ < 150** (recommendation grade A).
So patients with **severe ARDS** (as defined there) are effectively **excluded from CLRT as a therapy option** in this guideline.

### C. Acute cerebral lesions (restriction similar to prone)
- If CLRT is used in acute brain injury, the guideline applies the **same caution as prone positioning**, including **continuous ICP monitoring** (►18).

---

## 4) Patients for whom **early mobilisation** should not be applied (or only very limited/individualized)

The guideline is explicit that early mobilisation should be done in principle **only if no exclusion criteria apply** (►37), but it also states that **clear, universally defined exclusion criteria are not established in the literature**. Instead, it provides **typical relative contraindications** and **stop/cancellation criteria**.

### A. Relative contraindications (mobilise only after individual risk–benefit decision)
Examples given (►39):
- **Increased intracranial pressure**
- **Active bleeding**
- **Acute myocardial ischaemia**
- **Agitated delirium**

In these situations, the patient is not automatically “never mobilise,” but they are **not suitable for routine early mobilisation**; at most, **limited forms** (passive or assisted) may be considered case-by-case.

### B. Patients lacking minimum physiologic reserve (practical exclusion)
The guideline requires (►38) adequate:
- **Symptom control** (pain/fear/agitation/delirium controlled, e.g., RASS-guided)
- **Respiratory reserve**
- **Cardiovascular reserve**

It gives reference thresholds; patients outside these are typically **not candidates** until stabilized, e.g.:
- Mean arterial pressure **≤ 65** or **≥ 110** mmHg
- Systolic BP **≥ 200** mmHg
- Heart rate **≤ 40** or **≥ 130/min**
- Oxygen saturation **< 88%**
- **High-dose vasopressor therapy** (mentioned as a limiting factor)

### C. Mandatory stop criteria during mobilisation (patients who “become excluded” during the session)
Mobilisation should be **cancelled** if any occur (►43):
- SaO₂ **< 88%**
- HR increase **> 20%**, or HR **< 40** or **> 130/min**
- **New dysrhythmias**
- Systolic BP **> 180** mmHg
- Mean BP **< 65** or **> 110** mmHg

---

## 5) Patients in whom certain “standard positions” are discouraged (practical non-use)

This is not an “exclusion from the guideline,” but it is a clear “do not use long-term” statement:

- **Flat supine position** should not be used long-term in critically ill patients (►34), and should be minimized if unavoidable.
- **Trendelenburg position** should not be used in critically ill patients (►35) and should be **principally avoided in obese patients** (►36).

So patients who would require prolonged supine/Trendelenburg for other reasons are **not suitable for applying the guideline’s general positioning strategy** as written.

---

### If you want, tell me which part you mean by “cannot use this guideline”
Do you mean:
1) **Excluded from the evidence base** (e.g., paediatrics), or  
2) **Cannot receive specific interventions** (prone/CLRT/mobilisation), or  
3) **Not suitable for the overall ICU positioning/mobilisation approach**?

If you specify the intervention (prone vs mobilisation etc.), I can turn the above into a one-page checklist.",painmg,exclusion_criteria_extraction
PMC12421115.txt,"## TARGET POPULATION (extracted from the provided guideline text)

This document is **not a clinical practice guideline for a disease/condition** (eg, melanoma, prostate cancer, gastric cancer). It is a **methodology/reporting guideline** about how to **produce, review, and use narrative reviews** in the field of **anesthesia and pain medicine**. As a result, it does **not** define a patient target population (no age, stage, diagnosis, inclusion/exclusion criteria).

Instead, the “target population” is made up of **intended users/readers** of the guideline.

---

## Target population segment 1: Producers (authors) of narrative reviews
**Who this applies to (explicitly stated):**
- “**authors**” / “**producers**” of narrative reviews
- Specifically in **anesthesia and pain medicine**
- Including those writing for **Regional Anesthesia & Pain Medicine (RAPM)**

**What they are being guided to do:**
- Use the paper’s **recommended checklist** to improve consistency and clarity in narrative reviews.
- Clearly distinguish narrative reviews from systematic/scoping reviews.
- Follow a narrative review approach described as a **“noncomprehensive and non-exhaustive sample of the literature on a specific topic”** (attributed to Sukhera).

**Scope context (why these users need it):**
- The guideline frames the need as information overload in anesthesia/pain medicine literature and the practical need for reviews to help clinicians/researchers.

---

## Target population segment 2: Reviewers and editors (peer review / journal process)
**Who this applies to (explicitly stated):**
- “**reviewers**”
- “**editors**”
- Journal context is explicitly referenced (eg, **RAPM**)

**What they are being guided to do:**
- Use the checklist to **evaluate** narrative reviews.
- Help ensure narrative reviews include necessary elements and are not confused with systematic/scoping reviews.

---

## Target population segment 3: Consumers/readers of narrative reviews (end users)
**Who this applies to (explicitly stated):**
- “**consumers**” of narrative reviews
- Also described as “**readers**”
- In the field of **anesthesia and pain medicine**
- Includes “busy **clinical practitioners** and/or **clinical researchers**” (described in the overview as the audience affected by volume of literature)

**What they are being guided to do:**
- Use the checklist and guidance to **interpret** narrative reviews appropriately.
- Understand what narrative reviews are (and are not), relative to systematic/scoping reviews.

---

## Out-of-scope clarification (important)
- **No patient population is defined.** The text does not specify “adult patients with X condition…” or any clinical inclusion/exclusion criteria.
- The guideline’s scope is **how to write/review/read narrative reviews**, not how to treat a patient group.

If you upload/attach a different clinical guideline (PDF/image) that contains patient eligibility language, I can extract the exact “Target Population” section(s) verbatim and summarize each subgroup.",painmg,target_population_extraction
PMC12421115.txt,"This article is **not a clinical practice guideline for treating patients**, so it does **not** have “exclusion criteria” in the sense of “which patients cannot use it.” It is a **methodological/reporting guideline** for how to **write, review, and read narrative review articles** in anesthesia and pain medicine.

### So who/what is “excluded”?
Instead of excluding *patients*, it effectively excludes (or is not intended for) certain **types of articles, purposes, and use-cases**:

#### 1) Not for patient-level decision-making as a stand-alone tool
- **Patients (and clinicians)** should not treat this as a document that tells you **what therapy to choose** for an individual patient.
- It provides **how to produce/evaluate narrative reviews**, not treatment recommendations.

#### 2) Not for systematic reviews (or scoping reviews)
If the goal is a comprehensive, reproducible evidence synthesis, this guideline is **not the right framework**. It is not intended for:
- **Systematic reviews** (which should follow PRISMA, have a protocol, comprehensive search, etc.)
- **Scoping reviews** (which also have structured methods and reporting guidance, e.g., PRISMA-ScR)

In other words, if an author is doing:
- an exhaustive search,
- predefined inclusion/exclusion criteria for studies,
- standardized data extraction,
- risk-of-bias assessment,
- meta-analysis,
then they should be using **systematic/scoping review standards**, not this narrative-review checklist.

#### 3) Not for “rapid,” “umbrella,” “realist,” or “integrative” reviews (unless adapted)
The paper mentions these exist, but its checklist is aimed at **narrative reviews** specifically. Those other review types have different aims/methods and often different standards.

#### 4) Not for topics where a narrative approach would be inappropriate
A narrative review is described here as a **“noncomprehensive and non-exhaustive sample of the literature.”** So it is a poor fit when the question requires:
- **complete capture of all evidence** (e.g., “Does drug X reduce mortality vs placebo?”)
- **quantitative pooling** (meta-analysis) to estimate effect size
- **formal certainty-of-evidence grading** intended to support guidelines/policy

#### 5) Not a tool to justify selective citation (“cherry-picking”)
Because narrative reviews are non-exhaustive, they are vulnerable to bias. This guideline is meant to improve transparency, but it does **not** legitimize:
- selectively citing only supportive studies,
- making strong causal/clinical claims without balanced coverage,
- presenting narrative conclusions as if they were systematic-review conclusions.

### Bottom line
There are **no patient exclusion criteria** because **patients are not the unit of eligibility** here. The “exclusions” are really about **when you should not use a narrative-review guideline**—namely, when you are doing (or need) a **systematic/scoping/other structured review**, or when you need **patient-care recommendations** rather than guidance on **review writing and appraisal**.

If you tell me whether you’re asking as a **clinician**, **patient**, **author**, or **journal reviewer**, I can translate this into a practical “when to use vs not use” checklist for your situation.",painmg,exclusion_criteria_extraction
PMC6593444.txt,"## TARGET POPULATION (extracted from the guideline text)

This document’s recommendations/standards apply to **patients with Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS)**, specifically:

- **People with a painful, disabling, typically post‑traumatic pain disorder** (“Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a painful and disabling post‐traumatic primary pain disorder…”).
- CRPS **usually affects distal limbs** (“…affecting, usually, distal limbs…”).
- Patients in whom CRPS is **clinically suspected/considered likely**, characterized by a **regional distal extremity problem not matching a single nerve territory**:
  - “The use of these criteria requires some degree of prior belief that the condition is likely to be CRPS, that is, the patient has a regional affection distally in extremities, not corresponding to a nerve innervation territory.”
  - **Exception:** **CRPS II after nerve injury** may sometimes match the injured nerve territory (“As an exception, the rare subtype of CRPS II after nerve injury can sometimes correspond to the injured nerve's innervation territory.”).
- Patients across the **full spectrum of CRPS severity**, from **mild** to **severe/complex**, because the standards explicitly differentiate care needs by severity:
  - “The management of **mild** (mild pain and mild disability) CRPS may not require a multi‐professional team; however, the degree of severity and complexity of CRPS must dictate the need for appropriately matched multi‐professional care…”
- Patients who may require **escalation of care** based on response/complications:
  - Those **not improving within ~2 months** despite engagement in rehabilitation (“Referral to specialized care must be initiated for those patients who do not have clearly reducing pain and improving function, within 2 months…”).
  - A **small subgroup with complications** or **extreme psychological distress** requiring “super‑specialized” care:
    - “complications such as **CRPS spread, fixed dystonia, myoclonus, skin ulcerations or infections or malignant oedema**… and those with **extreme psychological distress**.”

## Segmented target populations (with specific summaries)

### 1) Suspected/diagnosed CRPS (core population)
- **Who:** Patients with suspected or confirmed CRPS affecting a distal limb, typically post-trauma, presenting with a regional pattern not limited to a single nerve distribution (except CRPS II).
- **Key boundary:** CRPS is treated as a **diagnosis of exclusion** (“These criteria stipulate that CRPS is a diagnosis of exclusion…”).

### 2) Mild CRPS
- **Who:** Patients with **mild pain and mild disability**.
- **Implication in scope:** May be managed without a full multi-professional team, but still within the CRPS care standards (“…may not require a multi-professional team…”).

### 3) Persistent/non-improving CRPS after initial treatment
- **Who:** Patients who, after starting treatment and engaging in rehabilitation, **do not show clearly reducing pain and improving function within ~2 months**.
- **Implication in scope:** Targeted for **referral to specialized care**.

### 4) Complicated/severe CRPS and/or extreme psychological distress
- **Who:** Patients with serious complications (spread, fixed dystonia, myoclonus, ulceration/infection, malignant oedema) and/or **extreme psychological distress**, and those not improving even in specialized services.
- **Implication in scope:** Targeted for **referral to “super-specialized” care** and advanced interventions.

## Notable exclusions / what is *not* required (scope clarifiers from the text)
- The guideline indicates CRPS diagnosis **does not require diagnostic tests** except to rule out other conditions (“Diagnosing CRPS does not require diagnostic tests, except to exclude other diagnoses.”).  
  *This is not an exclusion of patients, but it clarifies that the target population is defined clinically rather than by test-confirmed criteria.*

If you upload the PDF or provide the full guideline file (the excerpt you pasted may be incomplete), I can verify whether there is an explicit “Target population” section elsewhere and extract it verbatim as well.",painmg,target_population_extraction
PMC6593444.txt,"This European Pain Federation document is a set of **standards for diagnosing and managing CRPS**. It is **not written as a “who is excluded” guideline** in the way many drug trials or procedure protocols are. Instead, it repeatedly emphasizes that **CRPS itself is a diagnosis of exclusion**—so the main “exclusion criteria” are essentially: **patients who do not have CRPS (by Budapest criteria) or who have a better alternative diagnosis explaining the presentation**.

Below are the practical groups of patients for whom these standards **should not be applied as a CRPS guideline** (or should only be applied after addressing the issue).

## 1) Patients who do **not meet Budapest (“New IASP”) diagnostic criteria**
The standards explicitly require use of the **Budapest criteria** (Standard 1). So patients are “excluded” if they don’t satisfy those criteria (e.g., pain is not disproportionate, signs/symptoms pattern doesn’t fit, etc.).

## 2) Patients whose presentation is **better explained by another diagnosis** (CRPS is a diagnosis of exclusion)
Standard 2 states tests are not required *except* to exclude other diagnoses. So the guideline should not be used as the primary management pathway when another condition explains the findings.

Typical “exclusions” here include (examples, not exhaustive):
- **Infection** (cellulitis, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis)
- **Vascular disorders** (acute limb ischemia, DVT, severe venous/arterial insufficiency, vasculitis)
- **Compartment syndrome**
- **Unhealed fracture, hardware complication, malunion/nonunion**
- **Peripheral nerve entrapment or focal neuropathy** that explains the distribution (note: CRPS II after nerve injury exists, but you still must judge whether the nerve lesion alone explains the picture)
- **Inflammatory arthritis / crystal arthritis**
- **Primary dermatologic disease** explaining color/temperature/sweating/skin changes
- **Central neurologic disorders** (stroke, myelopathy, etc.) explaining motor/sensory/autonomic changes
- **Malignancy** or other systemic disease causing regional pain/swelling

If any of these are plausible, the “CRPS standards” are not the right starting point until those are ruled out/treated.

## 3) Patients with pain that is **not regional/distal limb** in pattern (i.e., outside the intended CRPS phenotype)
The document frames CRPS as usually affecting **distal limbs** with a **regional** pattern not confined to a single nerve territory (with the noted exception that CRPS II can sometimes align with the injured nerve). If the problem is:
- clearly **non-limb** (e.g., trunk only), or
- clearly **non-regional** (e.g., isolated joint pain without regional autonomic/trophic features), or
- fully explained by a **single-nerve distribution** without broader CRPS features,  
then the CRPS standards are generally not applicable.

## 4) Patients in whom the key problem is **diagnostic uncertainty** (not yet established CRPS)
Because the standards are anchored to “patients diagnosed with CRPS…” (e.g., Standards 4, 8, 13, 14, 16), if the diagnosis is uncertain, the appropriate “pathway” is **differential diagnosis work-up and reassessment**, not full adoption of a CRPS management pathway.

## 5) “Exclusion” from *parts* of the pathway due to setting/availability rather than patient factors
Some standards require access to specialized or super-specialized services (Standards 5–7). This is not a patient exclusion, but in practice:
- patients who are **improving within ~2 months** with good engagement are *not candidates* for escalation to specialized care (Standard 5), and
- only a **small subgroup** with severe complications (spread, fixed dystonia, myoclonus, ulceration/infection, malignant edema, extreme psychological distress) are candidates for “super-specialized” referral (Standard 6).

So patients can be “excluded” from escalation tiers if they don’t meet those triggers.

### What the paper does *not* list as exclusions
It does **not** specify exclusions by:
- age (children/older adults),
- pregnancy,
- comorbidities (diabetes, autoimmune disease, etc.),
- duration (acute vs chronic),
- medication contraindications (those would be drug-specific, not guideline-wide).

If you tell me the context (e.g., you’re implementing this in a clinic, or you’re writing a protocol), I can convert the above into a clean “Eligibility / Exclusion criteria” section in checklist form.",painmg,exclusion_criteria_extraction
PMC12159282.txt,"## TARGET POPULATION (extracted from the guideline)

### Primary target population (patients)
**“The target population for the application of the recommendations in this guideline is patients with fibromyalgia.”**  
(Section: *Methods > Guideline Users and Target Population* 2.2)

**Additional population details stated elsewhere in the guideline (supporting context):**
- The guideline consistently frames recommendations as applying to **people diagnosed with fibromyalgia** (e.g., “patients with fibromyalgia” across recommendation statements).
- Evidence inclusion criteria define the population as: **“Fibromyalgia patients.”**  
  (Section: *Methods > Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria for Evidence* 2.6)
- The guideline does **not** specify:
  - an age cutoff (e.g., adult-only) for the patient target population,
  - sex restrictions (though some evidence cited involves women),
  - disease severity/stage subgroups,
  - explicit diagnostic criteria version (e.g., ACR 1990/2010/2016) as an eligibility requirement for applying recommendations.

### Secondary “target population” (intended users—who the guideline is for)
While not the “patient target population,” the guideline explicitly states who it is intended for:

**“This guideline is intended for use by rheumatologists, general practitioners, rehabilitation physicians, pain specialists, psychiatrists, TCM practitioners, and other healthcare professionals involved in the diagnosis, treatment, and management of fibromyalgia.”**  
(Section: *Methods > Guideline Users and Target Population* 2.2)

---

## Segmentation by target population (as supported by the text)
This guideline does **not** define multiple distinct patient target populations (e.g., adult vs pediatric, mild vs severe, with/without comorbidities). It defines **one** patient target population: **patients with fibromyalgia**.

However, it does reference a few *study/evidence subgroups* (not framed as separate target populations for the guideline), including:
- **Women with fibromyalgia** (mentioned in the context of VR-based therapy/exergame evidence: “in women” / “female fibromyalgia patients” in cited meta-analyses).
- **Fibromyalgia patients with prominent insomnia symptoms** (mentioned in CBT evidence discussion).

These are **not** presented as separate guideline target populations—just characteristics of some included studies.

---

## Concise target-population summary (usable in your template)

### TARGET POPULATION
Patients diagnosed with fibromyalgia (fibromyalgia patients). The guideline provides recommendations on nonpharmacological therapies for this population and does not specify age, sex, or severity restrictions for applicability.

If you upload the PDF/image of the guideline (or confirm this pasted text is complete), I can also verify whether any additional “scope exclusions” (e.g., pediatric patients, secondary fibromyalgia, comorbidity exclusions) appear elsewhere (often in an “Scope,” “Intended population,” or “Exclusions” section).",painmg,target_population_extraction
PMC12159282.txt,"The document you provided does **not** list a single, explicit set of *patient-level exclusion criteria* (e.g., “do not use in pregnancy,” “not for children,” etc.). It defines the **target population broadly as “patients with fibromyalgia”** and then gives **exclusion criteria only for the *evidence selection*** (which studies were excluded), not for which *patients* are excluded from using the guideline.

That said, from what *is* written, you can infer who **cannot appropriately use/apply this guideline** (or for whom it is not intended) in three main ways:

## 1) People who do not have fibromyalgia (or do not meet diagnostic criteria)
- The guideline’s target population is **fibromyalgia patients**.
- Therefore, it is **not intended** for:
  - People with chronic widespread pain from other causes (e.g., inflammatory arthritis, hypothyroidism, myositis, neuropathic pain syndromes) unless they also have fibromyalgia.
  - People with regional pain syndromes only (e.g., isolated low back pain) without fibromyalgia.

## 2) Populations not represented by the evidence base (scope limitations)
The guideline does not clearly state age/sex restrictions, but the evidence summarized includes signals that some groups were underrepresented:

- **Non–Chinese/English language contexts**: Evidence was limited to **Chinese and English** publications. This is not a “patient exclusion,” but it limits generalizability to settings where other-language evidence might matter.
- **Men and non-female populations**: Some interventions (notably **VR-based therapy/exergames**) are described as studied in **women** (“in women” is explicitly stated). So applying those recommendations to men is less evidence-supported.
- **Children/adolescents**: The guideline does not mention pediatric fibromyalgia or pediatric trials. In practice, that means it is **not clearly intended for pediatric patients**, because the evidence base is almost certainly adult-focused.

## 3) Patients who cannot safely receive a *specific intervention* (therapy-level contraindications/precautions)
Even if a patient “can use the guideline” overall, they may be **unable to use particular recommended therapies** due to contraindications. The guideline gives only a few explicit examples, but they matter:

### Massage (explicitly mentioned)
The guideline states:
- **Avoid deep tissue pressure** to prevent worsening pain.
- Use **caution** in:
  - **Osteoporosis**
  - **Sensitive skin**
So patients with significant osteoporosis, fragile skin, bleeding/bruising tendency, or severe allodynia may be **poor candidates for massage**, especially deep techniques.

### Other interventions (not explicitly excluded in the text, but inherently require screening)
The guideline recommends/mentions therapies that, in real-world practice, have standard contraindications even though the document doesn’t list them. Examples:
- **Exercise (aerobic/resistance/aquatic)**: may be inappropriate without modification in people with unstable cardiopulmonary disease, acute injury, severe balance disorders, etc.
- **TMS/tDCS**: typically requires screening for seizure risk, implanted electronic/metal devices in/near the head, etc.
- **Hyperbaric oxygen therapy**: typically contraindicated in untreated pneumothorax and requires evaluation for ear/sinus issues, certain lung diseases, etc.
- **Acupuncture/cupping**: usually avoided or modified in bleeding disorders/anticoagulation, local skin infection, severe needle phobia, etc.

Importantly: these are **not stated as guideline exclusion criteria** in your excerpt; they are **standard clinical contraindications** that clinicians would apply when implementing any such therapy.

---

# Bottom line
**The guideline does not provide a formal “these patients cannot use this guideline” list.** It is intended for **patients diagnosed with fibromyalgia**, and exclusions are mainly:
1) **Not fibromyalgia** → outside scope  
2) **Groups not well covered by evidence** (especially pediatrics; some interventions studied mainly in women) → uncertain applicability  
3) **Contraindications to specific therapies** (massage precautions are explicitly stated; others require routine clinical screening even if not listed)

If you tell me which therapy you’re considering (e.g., acupuncture vs. TMS vs. exercise) and the patient’s key conditions (age, pregnancy status, anticoagulants, osteoporosis, pacemaker/implants, seizure history, severe cardiopulmonary disease), I can map out **practical “who should not receive it”** for that intervention.",painmg,exclusion_criteria_extraction
PMC10156497.txt,"## TARGET POPULATION (extracted from the provided guideline text)

### Primary target population (overall scope)
**Children (paediatric patients) experiencing acute pain**, particularly in **hospital/perioperative settings**, including:
- **Hospitalized children undergoing surgery** (perioperative and postoperative pain are a central focus).
- Children undergoing **painful diagnostic procedures**.
- Children requiring **analgesia and sedation** and/or **regional (conduction) anaesthesia** as part of perioperative care.

**Key scope signals from the text**
- The document is titled: **“Guidelines for treatment of acute pain in children”** and repeatedly frames recommendations as applying to **children/paediatric patients**.
- It emphasizes that acute pain is common in **hospitalized children**, especially after **surgical procedures**.
- It addresses pain assessment tools by **age group** (neonates/infants/young children vs older children), indicating broad paediatric age coverage.

---

## Target population segments (with significant details)

### 1) Perioperative / postoperative paediatric patients (core group)
**Who:** Children undergoing surgery who need perioperative and postoperative pain control.  
**Where:** Hospital perioperative pathways; includes reference to **ERAS in paediatrics** (enhanced recovery).  
**What’s distinctive in this group (as described):**
- High burden: the text notes that **many children undergoing surgery may experience moderate to severe pain**.
- Emphasis on:
  - **Regular pain assessment** (at least **3 times daily**) and documentation.
  - **Multimodal analgesia** as a foundational approach.
  - Use of **regional anaesthesia techniques** (often performed under deep sedation or general anaesthesia in children).
  - Avoiding “on-demand only” dosing; use **scheduled dosing** with **rescue doses** for breakthrough pain.
  - Avoiding **intramuscular** administration in children.

---

### 2) Age-defined subpopulations (pain assessment + pharmacology implications)
The guideline repeatedly distinguishes children by developmental stage because assessment and drug handling differ.

#### a) **Neonates, infants, and young children (non-verbal or limited verbal)**
**Who:** Neonates/infants/young children where self-report is not feasible.  
**Key details:**
- Pain assessment is difficult due to limited verbal communication.
- Recommended/mentioned tools rely on observation/physiology, e.g.:
  - **FLACC** (behavioural)
  - **CRIES** (physiologic/behavioural)
- Pharmacology/regional anaesthesia considerations highlighted:
  - Neonates have **lower α1-acid glycoprotein**, increasing free local anaesthetic fraction → higher toxicity risk.
  - Infants <6 months have reduced hepatic clearance/metabolism → prolonged elimination.
  - In continuous blocks, **local anaesthetic infusion rates should be reduced** (text indicates reduced by half in infants).

#### b) **Older children (able to self-report)**
**Who:** Children old enough to use self-report scales.  
**Key details:**
- Self-report tools mentioned:
  - **VAS**, **NRS**, **Faces Pain Rating Scale**
- The guideline supports routine, recorded pain scoring similar to vital signs.

---

### 3) Children receiving regional (conduction) anaesthesia / nerve blocks
**Who:** Paediatric patients for whom regional analgesia is feasible/indicated (perioperative pain management).  
**Key details:**
- Regional techniques are described as a **fundamental element** of modern paediatric pain management.
- In children, blocks are typically performed **in deep sedation or under general anaesthesia**.
- Safety/monitoring issues specifically discussed for this population:
  - Use of **ultrasound** and/or **nerve stimulator** to improve safety and effectiveness.
  - **Test dose with adrenaline** is recommended to detect intravascular injection (with limitations in young children due to higher baseline HR).
  - Discussion of **acute compartment syndrome (ACS)** and how regional anaesthesia may interact with diagnosis (no evidence it increases risk; low-concentration LA suggested).
  - Management of **local anaesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST)** including lipid emulsion dosing.

---

### 4) Children with acute post-traumatic pain (first 72 hours after trauma)
**Who:** Children with **acute post-traumatic pain**, especially early after injury.  
**Where:** Scene of accident, transport, emergency department, hospital ward.  
**Key details:**
- The guideline explicitly frames acute post-traumatic pain as dominant in the **first 72 hours**.
- Treatment intensity is linked to pain scores (VAS/NRS/FLACC):
  - **>7/10**: strong opioid (e.g., fentanyl or morphine) and/or ketamine discussed.
  - **1–6/10**: non-opioids and NSAIDs.
- Route considerations immediately after trauma:
  - Prefer **IV or intraosseous/intramedullary** routes due to impaired perfusion of muscle/subcutaneous tissue.

---

### 5) Children with burn pain (burn disease phases)
**Who:** Children suffering from burns requiring analgesia for ongoing care (e.g., dressing changes, procedures).  
**Key details:**
- The guideline distinguishes:
  - **Early hypodynamic phase (up to 48h)**: reduced clearance due to reduced cardiac output; altered distribution due to plasma/albumin loss and resuscitation.
  - **Hyperdynamic phase (≥48h)**: increased cardiac output and increased hepatic/renal flow → increased clearance and changing dose requirements.
- Procedural pain management example:
  - During dressing changes/painful procedures: **propofol + ketamine (“ketofol”)** may be used.
- Notes opioid tolerance/hyperalgesia risk (“opioid paradox”) in burn patients receiving high-dose/chronic opioids.

---

### 6) Children in oncology / hospice contexts (route-of-administration subgroup)
**Who:** Children needing ongoing analgesia where IV/oral routes may be difficult, explicitly including **oncological/hospice patients**.  
**Key details:**
- The guideline recommends **continuous subcutaneous opioid administration** (e.g., morphine) particularly for **oncological/hospice** patients.
- Accepts **transdermal patches** as an option.
- Notes nasal/transmucosal routes as alternatives in certain situations (e.g., home hospice, burns, dressing changes), while also noting regulatory/approval limitations for children in Poland for some nasal opioid products.

---

## Out-of-scope / exclusions (what the guideline says it is NOT about)
The provided text frames the scope as **acute pain** management in children; it does **not** present recommendations for:
- **Chronic pain management** as a primary focus (gabapentinoids are mentioned mainly as perioperative adjuncts; chronic neuropathic pain is referenced but not positioned as the main scope).
- **Adult patients** (explicitly paediatric-focused throughout).

If you upload the original PDF/figure pages (or share the guideline link), I can extract the *exact* “Target population” section verbatim if it exists as a labeled heading in the source document.",painmg,target_population_extraction
PMC10156497.txt,"The document you quoted is a **general consensus guideline for acute pain management in children** (perioperative, post‑traumatic, burns, painful procedures). It does **not** contain one explicit “Exclusion criteria” section, so the practical answer is: **there are no global, across-the-board patient exclusions from the guideline as a whole**. Instead, the guideline repeatedly signals that **certain children should not receive particular drugs/techniques** (or should receive them only in ICU/with enhanced monitoring). In practice, those are the “exclusions” clinicians apply.

Below is a structured list of **which patients cannot use parts of this guideline (or cannot use it without specialist/ICU conditions)**, based on the contraindications/cautions explicitly mentioned in the text you provided.

---

## 1) Children for whom the guideline’s “standard ward” pathways are not appropriate (need ICU/specialist setting)
These children are not excluded from pain treatment, but **the guideline’s routine approaches (e.g., opioid infusions outside ICU) are not appropriate**:

- **Children who cannot be continuously monitored** when receiving therapies that require it (especially **continuous opioid infusions**, PCA/NCA, IV lidocaine infusions, ketamine infusions).  
  The guideline stresses that continuous infusions require **strict/continuous vital-sign monitoring** due to respiratory depression or haemodynamic effects.

- **Children requiring very potent opioids (e.g., sufentanil)**  
  The guideline states sufentanil’s safe use should be **confined to the PICU**.

---

## 2) Drug-class exclusions / “do not use” groups (by patient condition)

### A. NSAIDs (ibuprofen, ketoprofen, diclofenac, naproxen, etc.) — patients who should not use or require strong caution
The guideline says NSAIDs have to be used with caution (and in practice may be avoided) in children with:

- **Allergy to NSAIDs** or significant **atopic history**
- **Asthma** (risk of NSAID-exacerbated respiratory disease in susceptible patients)
- **Gastric/duodenal ulcer disease**
- **Liver failure**
- **Kidney failure**
- **Risk factors for renal/hepatic failure**, specifically named:
  - **Dehydration**
  - **Shock**
  - **Multiple organ failure**
- **Increased bleeding risk** (NSAID antiplatelet/anti-aggregation effect via COX‑1)

Also, the guideline notes that **several NSAIDs should not be combined** (so children already receiving one NSAID are “excluded” from adding another).

### B. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) — patients in whom dosing limits are critical / may be unsuitable at high doses
The guideline highlights **hepatotoxicity** risk and the need not to exceed age-appropriate maximum daily doses. Practically, children with:
- **Significant liver disease/impairment** (or other high-risk situations for hepatotoxicity)
may be **excluded from high-dose regimens** and require individualized dosing.

### C. Metamizole — patients at risk from rapid IV dosing / haemodynamic instability
The guideline warns of **hypotension if IV metamizole is administered too fast**, especially in:
- **Hypovolaemia**
So children who are **hypovolaemic/unstable** are effectively excluded from rapid IV administration (and may need alternative analgesia or very cautious administration).

### D. Opioids (general) — patients where routine use is unsafe without enhanced monitoring
Not a blanket contraindication, but the guideline repeatedly implies exclusion from “routine” use in:
- **Premature babies and neonates**: morphine doses must be reduced due to immature liver/kidney function.
- Any child at high risk of **respiratory depression** where continuous monitoring cannot be ensured (especially with infusions).

### E. Tramadol — effectively excluded in some jurisdictions/contexts; restricted use
The guideline notes:
- The **FDA forbade tramadol in children** (insufficient safety evidence).
- ESPA: tramadol may be used in Europe **only in hospital settings**.
So children are effectively excluded from tramadol use:
- **Outside hospital**
- And in settings following FDA-style restrictions.

It also flags important interaction-based “exclusions” (see section 4).

### F. IV Lidocaine infusion — patients who should not receive it (or only with strong caution)
The guideline states lidocaine infusion should be used only in children with:
- **Stable haemodynamic parameters** (so **haemodynamically unstable** children are excluded)

And it requires special care/avoidance due to accumulation in:
- **Liver dysfunction**
- **Kidney dysfunction**
(plus note: lidocaine is **not removed by dialysis**, so dialysis does not “protect” from accumulation)

### G. Gabapentinoids (gabapentin/pregabalin) — excluded by age/approval and evidence limits
The guideline emphasizes:
- Use for perioperative analgesia is **off-label**.
- **Pregabalin safety under 17 years has not been demonstrated**.
So, practically:
- **Children/adolescents <17** are generally excluded from pregabalin in routine acute pain pathways (unless specialist off-label use with justification).

### H. Ketamine — special caution in burns; haemodynamic concerns
The guideline notes that in **children with burns**, ketamine may cause **hypotension** due to myocardial effects after prolonged catecholamine exposure/desensitization.  
So burn patients with cardiovascular instability may be excluded from ketamine or require very careful titration/monitoring.

---

## 3) Technique-based exclusions (regional/neuraxial analgesia)
The excerpt you provided does not list classic absolute contraindications (e.g., infection at puncture site, coagulopathy) in a single place, but it does identify groups where **risk is higher and dosing/approach must be modified**, which functions as partial exclusion from “standard” technique:

- **Neonates and infants (<6 months, and especially <1 year)**: higher free fraction of local anaesthetic, slower clearance, incomplete myelination → **higher toxicity risk**, so they are effectively excluded from “adult-like” dosing and require reduced infusion rates (the guideline says reduce continuous-flow dosing by half in infants <6 months).

- Any child where **local anaesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST)** risk is elevated (e.g., dosing uncertainty, impaired metabolism) requires strict adherence to dosing and readiness to treat LAST.

- The guideline also notes regional anaesthesia is typically performed **under deep sedation or general anaesthesia in children**, implying that children who cannot safely undergo sedation/GA in a given setting are excluded from regional techniques there.

---

## 4) “Exclusions” created by drug–drug interaction warnings (cannot combine)
The guideline explicitly states some combinations should be avoided:

- **Tramadol + ondansetron**: avoid ondansetron if treating with tramadol (reduced effect/interaction risk noted).
- **Tramadol + metoclopramide**: should not be used due to **seizure risk**.
- **Multiple NSAIDs together**: “several NSAIDs should not be combined.”

So children already needing one of these interacting drugs are excluded from the conflicting option.

---

## 5) What the guideline does *not* exclude (important clarification)
- It does **not** say any subgroup of children should be left untreated for acute pain.
- It does **not** provide a single universal “do not use this guideline in…” list; instead it provides **drug- and setting-specific contraindications/cautions**.

---

If you tell me the **specific analgesic/technique** you’re implementing (e.g., NSAID-based multimodal regimen, morphine PCA, caudal epidural, IV lidocaine infusion) and the child’s **age + key comorbidities** (renal/liver disease, asthma, dehydration/shock, bleeding risk), I can translate the above into a clear “eligible vs not eligible” checklist for that pathway.",painmg,exclusion_criteria_extraction
PMC2688676.txt,"## TARGET POPULATION (extracted from the guideline text)

### Overall target population (scope of the guideline)
**Newborn infants (neonates), including preterm neonates—especially those cared for in the NICU—who undergo painful/invasive procedures and therefore require prevention and control of procedural pain.**

**Supporting text/details from the guideline:**
- The guideline focuses on **“procedural pain experienced by newborn infants”** and aims to develop guidance for **“preventing and controlling neonatal procedural pain.”**
- It emphasizes that **“neonates, especially when preterm, are more sensitive to nociceptive stimuli than older children.”**
- It is framed around routine NICU care: **“Adequate pain prevention and management should be an essential part of standard health care at the NICU.”**
- It addresses the high procedural burden: neonates in NICU experience **“a mean 16 painful procedures a day.”**

---

## Target populations segmented by procedure (as implied by the guideline)

Because this guideline is organized by **procedure type**, the practical “target population” can be segmented as **neonates undergoing each specific invasive procedure** below (often with subgroups such as term vs preterm, intubated vs non-intubated).

### 1) Neonates undergoing heel lancing (capillary blood sampling)
**Target population:** Term and preterm neonates requiring heel lance blood sampling.  
**Notable subgroup detail:** The guideline distinguishes **term neonates and heavier premature infants** when discussing alternatives (venipuncture preferred in these groups).

---

### 2) Neonates undergoing venipuncture, arterial puncture, or percutaneous central venous catheter insertion
**Target population:** Neonates requiring peripheral/arterial blood access or **percutaneous** central venous access (common NICU procedures).  
**Notable subgroup detail:** Mentions situations where **intubated and ventilated neonates** may receive systemic opiate bolus “as necessary.”

---

### 3) Neonates receiving intramuscular (IM) or subcutaneous injections
**Target population:** Neonates requiring IM or subcutaneous medication administration (with a preference for IV when possible).

---

### 4) Neonates undergoing central venous catheter insertion by surgical cut-down
**Target population:** Neonates requiring **surgically placed** central venous access (cut-down technique).  
**Notable subgroup detail:** Includes recommendations for **sedation/general anesthesia**, implying higher-acuity procedural contexts.

---

### 5) Neonates undergoing tracheal intubation (elective intubation premedication)
**Target population:** Neonates requiring **elective tracheal intubation**, where premedication strategies are considered.  
**Notable subgroup detail:** The guideline notes wide variation in approaches and drug combinations used for elective intubation in neonates.

---

### 6) Neonates undergoing lumbar puncture (LP)
**Target population:** Neonates requiring diagnostic/therapeutic lumbar puncture.  
**Notable subgroup detail:** Differentiates:
- **Intubated neonates** (systemic opiate bolus may be used in some cases)
- **Non-intubated term infants** (midazolam may be suggested if particularly restless, with monitoring)

---

### 7) Neonates undergoing chest tube insertion
**Target population:** Neonates requiring pleural drainage via chest tube placement.  
**Notable subgroup detail:** Differentiates **urgent vs non-urgent** insertion (affects local anesthesia approach) and notes systemic opiates in **intubated/ventilated** neonates.

---

### 8) Neonates undergoing chest tube removal
**Target population:** Neonates requiring removal of an indwelling chest tube.

---

### 9) Neonates undergoing screening for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP)
**Target population:** Neonates (typically premature infants) undergoing **ROP screening** (ophthalmoscopy/RetCam).  
**Notable subgroup detail:** Mentions RetCam screening specifically and procedural modifications (e.g., avoiding blepharostate).

---

### 10) Neonates undergoing laser therapy for ROP
**Target population:** Neonates receiving **laser treatment for ROP**.  
**Notable subgroup detail:** Discusses anesthesia strategies (local + general anesthesia, or local + sedation with airway support), implying higher procedural intensity.

---

## Key inclusion characteristics (what “counts” as the target population)
From the text, the guideline applies when all of the following are true:
- Patient is a **newborn infant (neonate)** (explicitly includes **premature** infants)
- The neonate is undergoing **painful/invasive procedures** (examples listed above)
- Often in the context of **NICU care**, including higher-acuity subgroups (e.g., **intubated/ventilated** neonates)

## Explicit exclusions (what is outside scope)
The guideline does **not** explicitly define exclusions in the way oncology guidelines often do (e.g., stage, histology). However, it does state that **drug pharmacology/pharmacodynamics** knowledge is **“not within the scope of this document”**—so it is not a pharmacology reference, but a procedural pain management guideline.

If you upload the original PDF (or share the title/journal link), I can re-check for any additional “Scope/Target population” wording that may not appear in the pasted text (e.g., an explicit “This guideline applies to…” statement in the front matter).",painmg,target_population_extraction
PMC2688676.txt,"The document you provided does **not** contain a formal “Exclusion criteria” section (i.e., it does not explicitly list categories of newborns for whom the whole guideline must not be used). Instead, it is written as a set of **procedure-specific recommendations** with repeated **safety caveats** and **implicit exclusions/contraindications**—mainly tied to (1) the baby’s clinical stability and airway status, and (2) contraindications to specific drugs/techniques.

Below is a detailed, practical way to interpret **which patients should not be managed using parts of this guideline**, or in whom the guideline **should not be applied as written**.

---

## 1) Patients for whom the guideline is not appropriate as a “stand‑alone” tool (needs specialist anesthesia/ICU-level management)
The guideline repeatedly warns that stronger analgesia/sedation in neonates can cause **apnoea, bradycardia, desaturation, airway obstruction**, etc., and therefore should be given only by clinicians able to rescue the airway and circulation.

So, the guideline should **not be used as written** (or should be used only with specialist involvement and full resuscitation readiness) in newborns who are:

- **Not in a setting with immediate airway/resuscitation capability** (no skilled staff, no ventilation equipment, no emergency drugs).
- **Clinically unstable** where even small changes in ventilation/hemodynamics are dangerous (e.g., severe respiratory failure, shock, severe pulmonary hypertension), unless managed by experts with full monitoring and support.

This is less a “patient exclusion” and more a **context-of-care exclusion**, but it effectively excludes many babies outside a NICU/OR environment.

---

## 2) Non‑intubated infants: implicit exclusion from systemic opioid boluses (and many sedative approaches)
Several recommendations for systemic opioids are explicitly limited to **intubated and ventilated neonates** (e.g., before central line procedures, chest tube insertion, etc.).

Therefore, newborns who are:
- **Not intubated / not mechanically ventilated**
are implicitly **excluded** from those parts of the guideline that suggest **IV opioid boluses**, unless you have a plan and capability to manage respiratory depression (and many units would require anesthesia involvement).

Similarly, for lumbar puncture the guideline suggests midazolam only in selected term infants and with monitoring—this implies that:
- **Preterm infants** and/or **infants without close cardiorespiratory monitoring** are generally **not candidates** for that sedative approach.

---

## 3) Procedure urgency: “non-urgent only” recommendations (e.g., EMLA)
Multiple recommendations depend on having time to prepare (e.g., EMLA requires ~60 minutes).

So, babies needing **immediate/emergent procedures** are effectively excluded from recommendations that require delay, such as:
- **EMLA before venipuncture/arterial puncture/LP/chest tube insertion** when the procedure cannot wait.

In urgent chest tube insertion, the guideline itself switches to **subcutaneous lidocaine** rather than EMLA—so the “exclusion” is: *do not use the EMLA-based pathway in urgent cases.*

---

## 4) Drug/technique-specific contraindications (patients excluded from specific recommendations)

### A) Exclusion from sucrose/glucose/breast milk strategies (relative/clinical contraindications)
The guideline strongly supports sucrose/NNS/human milk for minor procedures, but it does not list contraindications. In practice, newborns may be **poor candidates** for oral sweet solutions or oral feeds during procedures if they have:

- **High aspiration risk** (e.g., depressed consciousness, absent gag, significant respiratory distress, impending intubation).
- **NPO status** for surgical/airway reasons where oral administration is not allowed.
- **GI pathology where enteral administration is unsafe** (e.g., suspected/active NEC, significant ileus)—unit policies vary.
- **Severe fluid restriction** where even small volumes are restricted (relative).

These are not stated in the text, but they are common clinical exclusions for oral comfort measures.

### B) Exclusion from EMLA (lidocaine/prilocaine) pathways
The guideline recommends EMLA for several procedures, but does not spell out contraindications. Standard exclusions/contraindications include:

- **Known hypersensitivity** to amide local anesthetics (lidocaine/prilocaine).
- **Risk of methemoglobinemia** (classically a concern with prilocaine), which is higher in:
  - very young infants (especially early neonatal period),
  - infants with **G6PD deficiency**,
  - infants receiving other oxidizing drugs.
- **Compromised skin integrity** at the application site (burns, severe dermatitis) where absorption may be unpredictable.

Because the guideline does not discuss these, infants with these risks should be considered **excluded from the EMLA-based recommendations** unless a local policy supports its use with safeguards.

### C) Exclusion from midazolam/ketamine/opioid sedation approaches
The guideline suggests midazolam in selected cases and mentions ketamine/opioids in others. Newborns may be excluded from these approaches if they have:

- **No secured airway / high risk of apnea** (especially preterm infants) unless intubated and ventilated.
- **Hemodynamic instability** (sedatives/analgesics can worsen hypotension).
- **Known drug hypersensitivity**.

Again, the guideline implies this through its safety warnings and “intubated and ventilated” qualifiers rather than listing exclusions.

---

## 5) Specific clinical situations where the guideline itself flags risk (implicit exclusions/modifications)

### Lumbar puncture positioning
The guideline warns against **extreme flexion** because it can cause **significant hypoxemia**, “especially in critical patients.”
So, critically ill infants who desaturate easily are not excluded from LP, but they are effectively excluded from **standard positioning** and may require modified technique and higher-level support.

### Heel lancing recommendations
It recommends venipuncture over heel lance in term/heavier preterm infants (less painful). This is not an exclusion, but it does mean:
- Some infants are “excluded” from heel lancing as the preferred method when venipuncture is feasible and expertise exists.

---

## Bottom line
- The guideline is **intended for neonates in NICU-type settings**, but it does **not** provide a clean “these patients are excluded” list.
- The most important practical exclusions are:
  1) **Any baby in a setting without expert staff and immediate resuscitation capability** (for sedatives/opioids),
  2) **Non-intubated infants** for recommendations that assume **IV opioid boluses**,
  3) **Urgent/emergent procedures** for recommendations requiring long preparation (e.g., EMLA),
  4) **Infants with contraindications to specific agents** (EMLA/methemoglobinemia risk, local anesthetic allergy, aspiration risk for oral sucrose/milk, etc.).

If you tell me **which procedure** you’re implementing (heel lance, LP, chest tube, ROP exam, intubation, etc.) and the baby’s **gestational age, respiratory support (room air/CPAP/intubated), and urgency**, I can translate this into a clear, procedure-specific “who should not receive X” list.",painmg,exclusion_criteria_extraction
PMC7027571.txt,"## TARGET POPULATION (extracted from the guideline text)

This EFIC position paper is written for **patients with cancer-related pain**, spanning the full cancer trajectory (from survivorship/remission through advanced/progressive disease and end of life). It is intended to apply broadly across **all clinical services involved in cancer care** in EFIC member countries, rather than being limited to a single cancer type, stage, or treatment setting.

Below are the distinct target-population groupings that are explicitly described or clearly delineated in the text, with the key details preserved.

---

## 1) Patients with a history of cancer (universal screening group)
**Extracted target-population text (Standard 1):**
- “**Patients with a history of cancer should be routinely screened for pain at every engagement with a healthcare professional.**”
- Screening is intended for “**both patients in remission and those with ongoing disease**.”

**Significant details:**
- Applies to **any person with a cancer history**, not restricted by cancer type.
- Applies at **every healthcare encounter** (not only oncology visits).
- Explicitly includes:
  - **Patients in remission / cancer survivors**
  - **Patients with ongoing disease**

---

## 2) Patients identified with cancer-related pain (assessment group)
**Extracted target-population text (Standard 2):**
- “**Patients identified with cancer-related pain should receive a pain assessment when seen by a healthcare professional**…”
- Assessment should “**at a minimum**”:
  - “**classif[y] the cause of pain based on proposed ICD-11 taxonomy**”
  - “**establish[] the intensity and impact on quality of life**”

**Significant details:**
- This group is defined by **having cancer-related pain identified on screening or presentation**.
- The guideline recognizes multiple pain sources within this population:
  - Pain due to “**the cancer itself (cancer pain)**”
  - Pain due to “**cancer treatments, particularly surgery, chemotherapy (including hormonal, biological and immune therapies) and radiotherapy**”
  - Pain due to “**comorbid conditions unrelated to cancer**” (noted as “**around 10%–20% of pains in cancer patients**”)
- Notes that patients may have “**mixed types of pain simultaneously**” or pain that “**changes over time**,” implying reassessment needs.

---

## 3) Patients with advanced/progressing cancer pain (opioid access emphasis)
**Extracted target-population text (Standard 4 supporting text):**
- “**Access to opioid analgesia is critical for pain related to advanced and progressing cancer.**”

**Significant details:**
- This subgroup is defined by **advanced/progressing cancer** where pain control often requires **strong opioid access**.
- The document frames opioid access as a **system-level necessity** for this population.

---

## 4) Patients in the last weeks or days of life (end-of-life subgroup)
**Extracted target-population text (Standard 4 supporting text):**
- “**For patients with cancer-related pain who are in the last weeks or days of life, a tailored treatment plan is especially important and should anticipate analgesic needs.**”

**Significant details:**
- Explicitly targets **end-of-life** patients (timeframe: “**last weeks or days of life**”).
- Emphasizes **anticipatory planning** for analgesia (not just reactive prescribing).

---

## 5) Cancer survivors / cured or prolonged remission with persistent pain (survivorship subgroup)
**Extracted target-population text (Standard 7 supporting text):**
- “With improved early cancer diagnosis and enhanced treatments, many patients are now living with cancer as a chronic disease.”
- “Increasing numbers of patients experience **cure or prolonged remission and are regarded as cancer survivors**.”
- “**Some of these patients will continue to experience pain which negatively affects their quality of life**.”
- Also (Standard 4 supporting text): opioid analgesia “**may not always be suitable for long-term management of pain related to cancer treatments… in the context of disease that has been cured or is in remission**.”

**Significant details:**
- Explicitly includes **survivors** and those in **cure/prolonged remission** who still have pain.
- Highlights that pain may be **treatment-related** (e.g., post-surgery, post-chemotherapy).
- Signals a management nuance: **long-term opioid therapy may be inappropriate** for some survivors with treatment-related pain.

---

## 6) Patients whose pain is complex, not improving, or with intolerable side effects (referral subgroup)
**Extracted target-population text (Standard 7):**
- “**Patients should be referred for more specialist advice and treatment if pain is not improving within a short time or if they are experiencing intolerable side effects of analgesia**…”
- Referral indicated if pain is “**not well controlled despite initial management**” or “**identified as complex**.”
- Urgent referral for those with “**severe uncontrolled pain, significant drug related adverse events or extreme psychological distress**.”

**Significant details:**
- This subgroup is defined by **response failure**, **complexity**, or **harm/distress**.
- Includes both:
  - **Routine escalation** (not improving / complex)
  - **Urgent escalation** (severe uncontrolled pain, major adverse events, extreme distress)

---

## Consolidated “Target Population” statement (faithful to the guideline)
**Patients with a history of cancer—including those in remission/cured (cancer survivors), those living with ongoing or advanced/progressing disease, and those in the last weeks/days of life—who experience cancer-related pain (from the cancer itself, cancer treatments, or comorbid causes).** The standards also specifically address patients whose pain is complex, poorly controlled, or associated with intolerable analgesic side effects requiring specialist referral.

---

If you upload the actual PDF/file (or share a link) rather than pasted text, I can also (1) quote the exact “Target population” section if it exists as a labeled heading, and (2) provide page/section citations.",painmg,target_population_extraction
PMC7027571.txt,"This EFIC position paper is written as **service-level standards** for **all patients with cancer-related pain** (people with active cancer, advanced disease, and cancer survivors with persistent pain). It is **not a patient “eligibility” guideline** in the way a drug trial protocol is, so it does **not** provide a formal list of “exclusion criteria.”

That said, there are clear situations where the standards **do not apply as written**, or where parts of them should **not be used to guide treatment decisions**:

## 1) People without a history of cancer / without cancer-related pain
- The standards are explicitly for **patients with a history of cancer** and **cancer-related pain**.
- If a person has **no cancer history**, or their pain is clearly **unrelated to cancer or its treatment**, then this document is not the appropriate primary framework (even though some general pain principles overlap).

## 2) Pain that is primarily from non-cancer comorbidities (use other pain guidelines)
The paper notes that **~10–20%** of pain in cancer patients is due to **comorbid conditions unrelated to cancer**. Examples:
- Osteoarthritis, chronic low back pain unrelated to metastases
- Diabetic neuropathy not caused/worsened by chemotherapy
- Fibromyalgia, migraine, etc.

These patients are **not “excluded” from care**, but their pain should be managed mainly according to **non-cancer chronic pain guidance**, not cancer-pain opioid escalation pathways.

## 3) Long-term opioid therapy for cancer survivors in remission/cured disease (key “not suitable” area)
The document explicitly cautions that:
- **Opioid analgesia may not always be suitable for long-term management** of pain related to cancer treatments (e.g., post-surgical pain syndromes, chemotherapy-induced neuropathy) **when the cancer is cured or in remission**.

So, patients who are:
- **Cancer survivors**, in **remission/cured**, with **persistent treatment-related pain**
are not excluded from the *standards* (they should still be screened/assessed/treated), but they **should not automatically be managed using “advanced cancer pain” opioid approaches**. They often need a chronic-pain style plan (rehab, neuropathic agents, psychological support, interventional options, careful opioid risk/benefit).

## 4) Children/adolescents (not clearly covered)
The paper is framed around general oncology/palliative services and does not specify paediatric adaptations. In practice:
- **Paediatric cancer pain** often requires different assessment tools, dosing, safeguarding, and specialist paediatric palliative care involvement.
So children are not explicitly excluded, but the document is **not paediatric-specific**, and paediatric guidelines should be used.

## 5) Patients in whom urgent/emergency pathways override “routine” standards
Some standards assume routine screening, assessment, and review timelines. Patients with emergencies need immediate condition-specific management first, e.g.:
- Suspected spinal cord compression
- Pathological fracture/impending fracture
- Neutropenic sepsis with severe pain
- Acute abdomen, bowel obstruction, etc.

Again, not excluded from the overall intent, but **the sequence and setting** of care differs (emergency management first).

## 6) People for whom the document is not intended as a prescriptive protocol
The paper repeatedly positions itself as **minimum standards** and does not specify:
- Which professional must do each step
- Exact drug choices/doses
- Detailed algorithms for special populations (renal failure, severe respiratory disease, active substance use disorder, etc.)

So patients with complex contraindications to certain analgesics are not “unable to use the guideline,” but clinicians must rely on **local/national protocols and specialist input** for safe prescribing.

---

### Bottom line
There is **no formal exclusion list** in this EFIC standards paper. The closest practical “cannot use as written” groups are:
1) **No cancer history / no cancer-related pain**, and  
2) **Cancer survivors in remission/cured where long-term opioid therapy is being considered** (the paper explicitly warns opioids may be unsuitable long-term), plus  
3) **Paediatric patients** (not specifically addressed) and  
4) **Acute emergencies** where routine standards are superseded by urgent care.

If you tell me the patient group you’re thinking of (e.g., survivor with neuropathy, active metastatic disease, renal impairment, history of opioid use disorder), I can map which standards still apply and which parts need modification.",painmg,exclusion_criteria_extraction
PMC8048441.txt,"## TARGET POPULATION (extracted from the guideline text)

### Primary target population (in-scope)
**Patients undergoing elective caesarean section performed under neuraxial anaesthesia** (i.e., spinal/epidural/combined spinal–epidural), for whom the guideline provides **procedure-specific postoperative pain management (PROSPECT) recommendations**.

**Key scope details included in the text:**
- Focus is **postoperative pain management after elective caesarean section**.
- Applies when the caesarean is **elective** and the anaesthetic technique is **neuraxial**.
- The guideline’s recommendations are intended to support **optimal pain management** and to **minimise systemic opioid utilisation**, including **individualised/stratified post-discharge opioid prescribing**.

### Populations explicitly excluded / out of scope
The guideline states the recommendations **do not apply** to:
1. **Emergency or unplanned operative deliveries / emergency or unplanned caesarean section**
   - Explicitly excluded in the review inclusion criteria and reiterated in discussion (“should not be applied”).
2. **Caesarean section performed under general anaesthesia**
   - Explicitly excluded and reiterated as not applicable.

### Populations where applicability may be limited (caution noted)
The guideline cautions that recommendations **may not be applicable** (or evidence is limited) for parturients with:
- **Co-existing medical conditions**, specifically mentioned:
  - **Morbid obesity**
  - **Chronic pain**
- **Preterm delivery**
- Also notes that most included studies involved **healthy, full-term parturients**, limiting generalisability to higher-risk groups.

## Segmented summary by target population category

### 1) Elective C-section under neuraxial anaesthesia (core population)
- This is the **intended population** for the full multimodal analgesia recommendations (e.g., intrathecal morphine/diamorphine, paracetamol, NSAIDs, i.v. dexamethasone, and conditional regional techniques if intrathecal opioid not used).
- Emphasis on **opioid-sparing** strategies and **multimodal** analgesia.

### 2) Emergency/unplanned C-section (excluded)
- **Not covered**; evidence review excluded these cases and the guideline warns against applying recommendations to them.

### 3) C-section under general anaesthesia (excluded)
- **Not covered**; excluded from evidence base and explicitly stated as outside applicability.

### 4) Higher-risk/less-studied subgroups (limited applicability)
- **Morbid obesity, chronic pain, preterm delivery**: guideline notes the evidence base largely reflects healthy, full-term patients, so recommendations may not translate directly.

If you upload the actual PDF/image of the guideline (instead of pasted text), I can also extract the *exact* “Target population” section verbatim (if it exists as a labeled heading) and quote it with page/section location.",painmg,target_population_extraction
PMC8048441.txt,"This PROSPECT guideline is **procedure- and population-specific**. It is intended for **elective (planned) caesarean section performed under neuraxial anaesthesia** (spinal, epidural, or combined spinal–epidural). Patients outside that scope are the main “exclusion criteria” for using the guideline as written.

## 1) Delivery/operation type excluded
These recommendations **should not be applied** to:
- **Emergency caesarean sections**
- **Unplanned operative deliveries** (i.e., urgent/intrapartum conversions to caesarean)

Reason: the evidence review **excluded** these scenarios, and pain pathways, anaesthetic choices, time constraints, and risk profiles differ.

## 2) Anaesthetic technique excluded
These recommendations **are not intended** for caesarean section performed under:
- **General anaesthesia**

Reason: the systematic review **excluded** studies of caesarean under general anaesthesia, and the recommended core elements (e.g., intrathecal morphine/diamorphine) are neuraxial-specific.

## 3) Patient groups where applicability is uncertain (not well covered by evidence)
The paper explicitly notes that most included studies enrolled “healthy, full-term parturients,” so the recommendations **may not be applicable** (i.e., should be used cautiously/individualised rather than followed as a strict pathway) in patients with:
- **Significant co-existing medical conditions** (the paper gives examples such as):
  - **Morbid obesity**
  - **Chronic pain**
- **Preterm delivery**

These are not always “hard exclusions,” but they are **populations not adequately represented** in the evidence base used to build the guideline, so direct application may be inappropriate without modification.

## 4) Intervention-specific contraindications (patient-level exclusions for parts of the guideline)
Even within the intended population, some *components* of the recommended regimen cannot be used in certain patients due to standard contraindications (the guideline explicitly flags this for dexamethasone and implies it for other drugs). Examples:
- **NSAIDs**: patients with NSAID allergy, significant renal impairment, high bleeding risk, certain platelet/coagulation disorders, active peptic ulcer disease, etc.
- **Paracetamol (acetaminophen)**: severe hepatic impairment.
- **IV dexamethasone**: “in the absence of contraindications” (commonly includes poorly controlled diabetes/hyperglycaemia risk, systemic infection concerns depending on context, steroid hypersensitivity, etc.).
- **Neuraxial opioids (intrathecal/epidural morphine/diamorphine)**: opioid allergy/intolerance, situations where neuraxial opioids are avoided due to side-effect risk or monitoring limitations.
- **Regional blocks/wound techniques**: local anaesthetic allergy, infection at injection site, local anaesthetic systemic toxicity risk considerations, etc.

These are not exclusions from the *guideline topic*, but they exclude a patient from receiving **that specific recommended element**.

### Bottom line
Patients who **cannot use this guideline as written** are primarily those undergoing:
1) **Emergency/unplanned caesarean**, and/or  
2) **Caesarean under general anaesthesia**.  

Additionally, the guideline warns that applicability is **uncertain** in **morbid obesity, chronic pain, and preterm delivery**, because these groups were not well represented in the included studies.",painmg,exclusion_criteria_extraction
PMC12464052.txt,"## TARGET POPULATION (extracted from the guideline text)

### 1) Primary target population: chronic non-cancer pain patients being considered for opioid therapy
**Population described in the guideline:**
- **Patients with chronic non-cancer pain** for whom opioid analgesics are being considered **as part of multimodal analgesia** (not as monotherapy).
- Opioids are positioned as an option **only when**:
  - **Non-pharmacological treatments are prioritized**, and
  - **Non-opioid pharmacologic therapies have been optimized** but pain persists, and
  - The **benefits (pain relief + physical function/ADLs)** are judged to **outweigh risks**.

**Key eligibility/selection details explicitly stated:**
- The guideline emphasizes **patient selection**, including:
  - **Obvious/clear organic cause** of persistent pain.
  - **Pain refractory to non-opioid therapies** (i.e., no effective alternatives).
  - **Low risk of psychosocial factors** contributing to pain (organic factors outweigh psychosocial factors).
  - **Good adherence** / ability to comply with medication instructions and follow-up.
  - **Understanding of the purpose** of opioid treatment (goal is improved QOL/ADLs, not rapid elimination of pain).
  - **No history of substance or alcohol dependence**.
- In CQ 3-2, the guideline further narrows “who can benefit” to:
  - Patients who **do not currently or previously have a substance use disorder**, and
  - Patients who **do not have other active psychiatric disorders**, and
  - Whose pain persists despite **optimal non-opioid pharmacological treatment**.

**Who is explicitly not eligible / outside appropriate use (avoid or extreme caution):**
- Patients at **high risk of dependence/abuse** (must be excluded at initiation).
- Patients who **do not follow medical instructions** or have **extremely poor cognitive function/poor adherence** (“not eligible for treatment”).
- Patients with **suspected psychosocial factors contributing to persistent pain**.
- Patients with **psychiatric disorders** (also reiterated as “not recommended in principle” for those with a history of mental illness).

---

### 2) Included subpopulation: cancer survivors with pain not directly caused by cancer
**Population described in the guideline:**
- **Cancer survivors** who have pain **not directly caused by cancer**, including:
  - **Pain after treatment**, or
  - Pain associated with **complications** or **pre-existing conditions**.

**How the guideline frames them:**
- The abstract and summary explicitly state that **these chronic non-cancer pain opioid-prescribing guidelines should be followed** for this cancer-survivor pain category.
- The guideline also notes this group as a context where **inappropriate opioid use has become a problem in Japan**, reinforcing the need for careful selection and control.

---

### 3) Populations requiring avoidance or special caution (explicitly identified)
The guideline repeatedly identifies groups who should **avoid opioids** or be treated with **extreme care**. These function as “target subgroups” for special handling:

#### A) Patients who should avoid opioids or require extreme caution (CQ 3-7)
- **Substance abuse disorder** (e.g., alcoholism, illicit drug abuse) and **overdose history**
- **Mental health conditions** (e.g., **depression**, **anxiety disorder**) or **taking benzodiazepines**
- **Age ≥65 years**
- **Pregnancy**
- **Moderate-to-severe sleep apnea syndrome**
- **Renal or hepatic dysfunction**

#### B) “Not recommended in principle” conditions (CQ 8-12)
Opioids are described as **extremely risky** and **not recommended** for:
- History of **mental illness**
- **Substance use disorders** (including alcohol abuse)
- **Sleep apnea syndrome**
- **Serious internal organ diseases**
- **Pregnant women**
- **Young people**

#### C) Adolescent and young adults (AYAs) (CQ 9-7)
- AYAs are described as **high risk for dependence and abuse**
- Therefore, opioids **should be avoided** for chronic non-cancer pain in this population.

---

## Consolidated “TARGET POPULATION” statement (faithful to the guideline’s wording and intent)

**Adult and other patients with chronic non-cancer pain (including cancer survivors with pain not directly caused by cancer, such as post-treatment pain or pain from complications/pre-existing conditions) in whom non-pharmacologic and non-opioid therapies have been prioritized/optimized, and for whom a trial of opioid analgesics is being considered only when expected benefits in pain relief and physical function/ADLs outweigh risks. Appropriate candidates are those with a clear organic cause of persistent pain, low psychosocial contribution, good adherence/cognitive ability to comply with strict monitoring, understanding of treatment goals (QOL/ADL improvement), and no current/past substance use disorder or active psychiatric disorder. Patients with substance abuse, significant psychiatric comorbidity, pregnancy, older age, sleep apnea, and renal/hepatic dysfunction are identified as groups in whom opioids should be avoided or used with extreme caution; opioids are also advised against in adolescents/young adults.**",painmg,target_population_extraction
PMC12464052.txt,"The guideline is **not meant to be applied to every patient with chronic non‑cancer pain**. It explicitly limits opioid use to carefully selected patients, and it identifies groups in whom opioids should be **avoided in principle** or used only with **extreme caution**. In practice, these function as the guideline’s *exclusion criteria* (patients who “cannot use” the guideline in the sense that opioid therapy under this guideline is generally inappropriate).

Below is a structured list of those patients, based on the statements in CQ3-7, CQ4-1, CQ8-12, and the summary section.

---

## 1) Patients at high risk of dependence, abuse, or overdose (generally excluded)
These are repeatedly highlighted as patients who should **avoid** opioid therapy for chronic non‑cancer pain.

### A. Current or past substance use disorder (SUD)
- **Alcohol use disorder / alcoholism**
- **Illicit drug abuse**
- **History of overdose**
- More broadly: any **substance abuse disorder** or strong suspicion of it

**Where in the guideline:** CQ3-7; CQ8-12; Summary item (5) “No history of substance or alcohol dependence”; CQ4-1 (exclude high risk of dependence/abuse).

### B. Patients likely to use opioids inappropriately or cannot be safely monitored
- Patients who **do not follow medical instructions**
- Patients with **very poor cognitive function** such that safe self-administration/monitoring is not feasible
- Patients with **poor medication adherence** (cannot reliably comply with dosing rules, storage, follow-up)

**Where:** CQ4-1; Summary item (4) “Good adherence”.

---

## 2) Patients with active psychiatric/mental health conditions (generally excluded)
The guideline draws a clear line that opioid trials are for patients **without active psychiatric disorders**, and it also says opioids are **not recommended** in those with a history of mental illness (high risk context).

### A. Active psychiatric disorders (avoid / exclude)
- **Depression**
- **Anxiety disorders**
- Other “active psychiatric disorders” (wording used in CQ3-2)

### B. Concomitant benzodiazepine use (avoid / extreme caution)
- Patients **taking benzodiazepines** are singled out because of increased sedation/respiratory depression risk and association with adverse outcomes.

**Where:** CQ3-2 (opioid trial only if no active psychiatric disorders); CQ3-7 (depression/anxiety, benzodiazepines); CQ4-1 (avoid in psychiatric disorders); CQ8-12 (history of mental illness = not recommended in principle).

---

## 3) Patients in whom psychosocial factors are suspected to be a major driver of pain (generally excluded)
The guideline emphasizes that opioids are for pain with a **clear organic cause** and where **organic factors outweigh psychosocial factors**.

So patients are effectively excluded when:
- The pain’s cause is **unclear**, or
- **Psychosocial factors are strongly suspected** to be contributing to persistence/worsening, such that the pain is not predominantly explained by organic pathology.

Examples of psychosocial contexts the guideline flags elsewhere include compensation/litigation contexts (traffic/work injuries) where psychosocial factors may be prominent and must be carefully assessed.

**Where:** CQ4-1 (avoid when psychosocial factors suspected); Summary items (1) and (6); CQ9-6 (work/traffic accident context requires attention to psychosocial factors).

---

## 4) Physiologic/medical conditions with high risk of serious opioid harm (avoid or “extreme care”)
These are listed as groups who should **avoid opioids or be treated with extreme care**; in many settings they function as “not eligible unless exceptional circumstances and specialist oversight.”

### A. Pregnancy (generally avoid)
- The guideline lists **pregnancy** as a group to avoid/extreme caution.
- It also notes risk of **neonatal respiratory depression and withdrawal**.

**Where:** CQ3-7; CQ8-12; CQ9-1.

### B. Moderate-to-severe sleep apnea syndrome (SAS) (generally avoid)
- Opioids can **cause or worsen SAS** and increase risk of **respiratory depression**.

**Where:** CQ3-7; CQ8-12; CQ9-5.

### C. Significant renal or hepatic dysfunction (avoid or extreme caution)
- **Renal dysfunction**: risk of accumulation (e.g., morphine/codeine metabolites) and neurotoxicity; caution also with tramadol/oxycodone.
- **Hepatic dysfunction**: reduced metabolism → higher exposure; dose/frequency reduction needed.

**Where:** CQ3-7; CQ9-3; CQ9-4; also drug-specific cautions in CQ2 sections.

### D. “Serious internal organ diseases” (not recommended in principle)
- The guideline uses this broader category in its “not recommended in principle” statement.

**Where:** CQ8-12.

---

## 5) Age groups at higher risk (generally avoid or require exceptional caution)
### A. Adolescents and young adults (AYAs) (avoid)
- Explicitly: AYAs are at **high risk of dependence and abuse**, so opioids **should be avoided** for chronic non‑cancer pain.

**Where:** CQ9-7; CQ8-12 (“young people”).

### B. Older adults (≥65 years) (avoid or extreme caution)
- Listed as “avoid or treat with extreme care.”
- Higher risk of adverse events (falls, delirium, respiratory depression, etc.); if used, lower starting/maintenance doses.

**Where:** CQ3-7; CQ9-2.

---

## 6) Patients who do not meet the guideline’s “required conditions” (practical exclusion)
Even if none of the high-risk items above apply, the guideline says opioid therapy for chronic non‑cancer pain should be limited to patients who meet *all* of these. Patients who **fail** these are effectively excluded:

- No **clear organic cause** of persistent pain
- Pain **not refractory** to optimized non-opioid and non-pharmacologic therapies
- Patient does **not understand/accept** the goal (QOL/ADL improvement, not complete pain elimination) or cannot share goals with clinicians
- Cannot provide **informed consent** / cannot agree to monitoring, tapering, and time-limited trial
- Poor adherence / cannot comply with instructions
- Organic factors do **not** outweigh psychosocial factors
- Any history of substance/alcohol dependence

**Where:** Summary item 6 (criteria 1–7); CQ3-1, CQ3-6 (benefit must outweigh risk); CQ4-3 (consent); CQ4-8 (time-limited use).

---

### Important nuance
The guideline sometimes phrases these as “**avoid or treat with extreme care**.” That means they are not always absolute contraindications, but they are **strong “do not use routinely” categories**—i.e., outside the guideline’s intended routine candidate population and typically requiring specialist judgment, enhanced monitoring, and often choosing alternatives.

If you tell me the patient profile you have in mind (age, diagnosis, comorbidities, current meds like benzodiazepines, renal/hepatic function, sleep apnea, substance use history), I can map it directly to the guideline’s exclusion/risk categories.",painmg,exclusion_criteria_extraction
PMC7379698.txt,"## TARGET POPULATION (extracted from the provided guideline text)

This guideline **does not contain a single, explicit “Target Population” section** written in the style of your examples. However, the target population can be **reliably extracted from the scope statements and the condition-/region-specific recommendation sections**.

Below are the **distinct target populations** the guideline addresses, with **significant details** pulled directly from the text and organized by population/clinical scenario.

---

## 1) Patients receiving epidural corticosteroid injections (ESIs) for radicular pain (overall scope)

**Extracted target population (scope-level):**
- Patients undergoing **epidural corticosteroid injections (ESIs)**, which are “used frequently worldwide in the treatment of **radicular pain**.”
- The guideline focuses on **safe use** and prevention of **rare major neurologic injuries** and other complications associated with ESIs.

**Key details that define this population in the document:**
- ESIs include approaches such as **caudal, interlaminar, and transforaminal (TF)** administration (explicitly discussed under minor complications and technique sections).
- The guideline addresses injections at different spinal regions: **cervical, thoracic, and lumbar** (complication patterns and recommendations differ by region).
- The document is framed as **safety recommendations** (imaging, contrast, needle/equipment, steroid type, volume, sedation, sterility, etc.), not as a disease-management guideline.

---

## 2) Patients with **subacute lumbosacral radicular pain / subacute lumbosacral radicular syndrome** (lumbar radicular pain)

**Extracted target population (condition-specific):**
- Patients with **(sub)acute lumbosacral radicular pain**, where conservative care is first-line and ESIs may be used to help patients “overcome the (sub)-acute phase of radicular pain.”
- The text notes a favorable natural history: symptoms resolve within **3 months in ~75%** of patients, and shared decision-making is emphasized.

**Key details / boundaries described:**
- ESIs are positioned as part of care during the period when many patients improve spontaneously and when surgery is often deferred (the text notes surgery “preferably… only… after 12 weeks”).
- For this population, the guideline provides specific technical safety constraints:
  - **TF approach recommended at L3 or lower** (to reduce risk related to the artery of Adamkiewicz).
  - **Particulate steroids only TF at L3 or lower**; this limitation “does not apply for dexamethasone.”
  - **Real-time fluoroscopy with contrast is mandatory** for TF injections.
  - **Limit (lumbar) TF volume to max 4 mL** and inject slowly.
  - **Lowest effective steroid dose** is recommended (examples given: MPA 40 mg; triamcinolone 10–20 mg; dexamethasone 10 mg).

---

## 3) Patients with **cervical subacute cervicobrachialgia** (cervical radicular pain)

**Extracted target population (condition-specific):**
- Patients treated for **subacute cervicobrachialgia** using cervical epidural corticosteroid injections.

**Key details / boundaries described:**
- The guideline distinguishes between **cervical interlaminar** vs **cervical TF** approaches:
  - **Negative recommendation** for **cervical TF injection of particulate corticosteroids** (risk + lack of proven added value).
  - TF dexamethasone: “not recommended due to lack of added value,” though the text also states there are “currently no counterarguments” for cervical TF dexamethasone (reflecting uncertainty/nuance).
  - For **interlaminar cervical injection**, the guideline states **no vascular complications were reported**, and **particulate corticosteroid (or dexamethasone 10 mg)** can be used.
- **Provider/setting implication**: cervical procedures are emphasized as higher risk and “best performed by algologists/pain specialists with special competence in interventional pain therapy.”

**Cervical technical constraints tied to this population:**
- Interlaminar cervical level: preferably **C7–T1**, at highest **C6–7**.
- **Prior radiological review** required: **MRI** (or **CT** second choice) to rule out “red flags” and assess available cervical epidural space.
- **Fluoroscopy with contrast** is emphasized as essential.
- **Total injected volume max 4 mL**.

---

## 4) Patients undergoing **cervical epidural procedures** (higher-risk regional population; not limited to one diagnosis)

**Extracted target population (region-specific safety group):**
- Patients receiving **cervical ESIs** (interlaminar and/or TF), because the guideline repeatedly treats cervical injections as a distinct high-risk category.

**Key details from the text supporting this as a separate target group:**
- “More major neurological complications” appear associated with **cervical** vs lumbar procedures, attributed to proximity of vascular structures and the spinal cord.
- The guideline explicitly states: “Considering the possible complications, **cervical procedures are reserved for pain specialists** with a special competence in interventional pain therapy.”
- The document highlights cervical-specific risks such as spinal cord injury from **needle trauma** (especially interlaminar route) and the unreliability of loss-of-resistance due to ligamentum flavum non-fusion.

---

## 5) Patients undergoing **lumbar transforaminal (TF) epidural injections** (technique-defined population)

**Extracted target population (procedure/technique-specific):**
- Patients receiving **lumbar TF epidural corticosteroid injections**, particularly because the guideline provides extensive TF-specific safety requirements and risk estimates.

**Key details defining this group:**
- TF injections have a higher chance of vascular puncture (lumbar **8%–15.5%**, **21.3% at S1**; cervical TF **19.4%** cited).
- Safety requirements include:
  - **Fluoroscopy + contrast under real-time imaging is mandatory** (DSA optional).
  - **Needle with extension line recommended**.
  - **Local anesthetic injection prior to TF corticosteroid injection** is recommended, with close monitoring for neurologic symptoms.
  - **Avoid unnecessary air** (flush extension lines/needles with liquid).
  - **Avoid excessive sedation** so the patient can respond during the procedure.

---

## 6) “High-risk patients” in the context of **accidental disc puncture** (special subpopulation)

**Extracted target population (risk-defined subgroup):**
- Patients considered **“high-risk”** where **prophylactic antibiotics may be considered** after (accidental) disc puncture.

**Key details:**
- Routine prophylactic antibiotics are **not recommended**, but “may be considered in **high-risk patients**.”
- The guideline references discitis incidence after discography (**0.25%–0.44%**) as part of the rationale.

*(Note: the guideline does not define “high-risk” further in the provided text.)*

---

### If you want, I can convert the above into a standardized “# TARGET POPULATION” block (or multiple blocks) matching your example format exactly, but I’d need to know whether you want it organized by **diagnosis** (cervicobrachialgia vs lumbosacral radicular syndrome) or by **procedure type** (cervical interlaminar, lumbar TF, etc.).",painmg,target_population_extraction
PMC7379698.txt,"The WIP Benelux “Safe Use of Epidural Corticosteroid Injections” document is primarily a **technical safety guideline** (how to perform ESIs more safely), not a patient-selection guideline. It therefore does **not** present one single, explicit “exclusion criteria” list. However, it *does* clearly imply several categories of patients in whom the guideline’s recommended technique **cannot be applied as written** (so the procedure should be avoided, postponed, or an alternative chosen), and it flags patient factors that require special caution or different management.

Below is a practical “who cannot use this guideline / who should not undergo ESI under this guideline as written” summary, based on what the document states or directly implies.

---

## 1) Patients in whom the guideline’s *mandatory safety steps* cannot be performed
These are effectively “cannot follow the guideline,” because the Benelux recommendations repeatedly make these steps **required/mandatory**:

### A. Patients who cannot receive iodinated contrast when contrast is required
The guideline states that **fluoroscopy + contrast is required** for:
- **Interlaminar lumbar and cervical** injections (to confirm epidural spread and exclude vascular/subdural placement).
- **All transforaminal (TF)** injections with **real-time fluoroscopy + contrast** (DSA optional).

So, if a patient has a **contrast allergy** (or another reason contrast cannot be used), then:
- The guideline’s standard technique **cannot be followed**.
- The document specifically advises **avoiding particulate steroids** in this situation and using **dexamethasone** (or even **local anesthetic alone**), or considering **pulsed RF** near the dorsal root ganglion.

**Practical exclusion (as written):** “Standard ESI per this guideline” is not applicable without contrast; you must switch to the document’s alternative pathway (dexamethasone / LA-only / other).

### B. Patients in settings where fluoroscopy (and real-time imaging for TF) is not available
Because the guideline makes imaging with contrast a requirement, a patient treated in a facility that cannot provide:
- **Fluoroscopy** (interlaminar), and
- **Real-time fluoroscopy** for TF,
cannot be treated according to this guideline.

**Practical exclusion:** ESI should not be performed “per Benelux guideline” without the imaging resources it mandates.

---

## 2) Patients with suspected “red flags” or unclear diagnosis until imaging review is done
For **cervical epidural injections**, the guideline explicitly requires:
- **Prior radiological review with MRI (or CT second choice)** to rule out red flags and assess epidural space.

So patients with cervical symptoms **cannot proceed under the guideline** until that imaging review is completed.

**Practical exclusion (temporary):** cervical ESI is “not eligible” until MRI/CT review rules out red flags and confirms adequate space.

---

## 3) Patients for whom a *specific approach/route* is discouraged (route-based exclusions)
These are not “no ESI ever,” but they are “cannot use this guideline to do *that* procedure in *that* way.”

### A. Cervical transforaminal (TF) injection with particulate steroid
The guideline gives a **negative recommendation** against:
- **Cervical TF injection of particulate corticosteroids** (risk outweighs unclear added value).

**Exclusion:** patients should not receive **cervical TF particulate steroid** under this guideline.

### B. Lumbar TF particulate steroid above L3
The guideline states:
- **Particulate corticosteroids must only be injected TF at L3 or lower**.
- Above L3, if TF is done, **dexamethasone** is preferred (because of Adamkiewicz/vascular risk).

**Exclusion:** patients needing TF treatment **above L3** should **not** receive **particulate steroid TF** under this guideline.

---

## 4) Patients in whom the procedure should be avoided or deferred due to bleeding risk (anticoagulants/coagulopathy)
The document highlights that:
- “Many complications related to anticoagulants and epidural infiltrations have been reported” and refers readers to **separate, specific anticoagulation guidelines**.

It does not list exact INR/platelet thresholds, drug stop times, etc., but the implication is:

**Exclusion (until managed per anticoagulation guidelines):**
- Patients on **anticoagulants/antiplatelets** or with **coagulation disorders** should not undergo ESI unless their regimen is managed according to the relevant neuraxial anticoagulation guidance.

---

## 5) Patients at unacceptable infection risk or with active infection (implied)
The guideline strongly emphasizes sterility and discusses catastrophic infections (meningitis/epidural abscess; contaminated steroid outbreaks). While it does not provide a formal “active infection = contraindication” list, standard neuraxial practice applies and is consistent with the document’s infection focus.

**Practical exclusion (implied):**
- **Active systemic infection**, **local infection at the puncture site**, or situations where sterile technique cannot be assured → do not proceed.

It also notes prophylactic antibiotics are **not routine** after accidental disc puncture, but may be considered in **high-risk patients**—which implies some patients may be poor candidates unless risk is mitigated.

---

## 6) Patients who cannot safely remain responsive (sedation-related exclusion)
The guideline recommends:
- **Avoid excessive sedation**, because inability to respond is associated with higher risk of unrecognized spinal cord injury during cervical procedures.

**Practical exclusion (relative but important):**
- If a patient cannot tolerate the procedure without deep sedation (or must be deeply sedated for other reasons), the procedure **should be reconsidered** or performed with a plan that still allows neurological monitoring (often meaning: don’t do it, postpone, or choose another therapy).

---

## 7) Patients in whom steroid exposure is unacceptable or requires alternative strategy (not absolute exclusions, but “cannot use standard steroid ESI”)
The document details systemic steroid effects (HPA suppression, immune suppression, hyperglycemia, bone loss). It doesn’t say “therefore exclude,” but clinically these are situations where steroid ESI may be inappropriate or require modification:

- **Known corticosteroid allergy** → the document suggests **local anesthetic alone** can be considered.
- **Contrast allergy** → avoid particulate steroid; use **dexamethasone** (or LA-only).
- **Diabetes** (post-injection hyperglycemia), **osteoporosis/fracture risk**, **significant endocrine risk** (HPA axis suppression/Cushing’s) → not excluded by the guideline, but require careful risk–benefit and dose minimization (the guideline recommends the **lowest effective dose** and spacing injections by at least **2 weeks**).

---

# Bottom line (most defensible “exclusion criteria” from this document)
A patient cannot be treated **according to this Benelux safety guideline** (or cannot receive certain ESI types under it) if any of the following apply:

1. **No fluoroscopy/real-time imaging with contrast can be used** (resource limitation or patient cannot receive contrast) → standard technique not applicable; use alternatives (dexamethasone/LA-only/other).
2. **Cervical ESI without prior MRI/CT review** to rule out red flags/assess space → do not proceed.
3. **Planned cervical TF with particulate steroid** → discouraged/“do not do.”
4. **Planned lumbar TF particulate steroid above L3** → “do not do” (use dexamethasone if TF is needed).
5. **Unmanaged anticoagulation/coagulopathy** (not addressed in detail here; must follow dedicated anticoagulation guidelines) → defer/avoid until compliant.
6. **Active infection or inability to ensure sterile conditions** → avoid.
7. **Need for excessive sedation such that patient cannot respond** → avoid/reconsider.

If you tell me the **region (cervical/thoracic/lumbar), intended route (interlaminar/TF/caudal), and key patient factors** (anticoagulants, contrast allergy, diabetes, infection risk), I can translate the above into a clear “eligible vs not eligible + what alternative the guideline recommends” decision pathway.",painmg,exclusion_criteria_extraction
PMC4190576.txt,"## TARGET POPULATION (extracted from the guideline text)

### Core target population (who the guideline applies to)
- **Children and adults with inherited/hereditary epidermolysis bullosa (EB)** who have **pain and/or pruritus (itch)** requiring management.
- Applies to **patients of all EB subtypes and ages**:
  - The guideline notes four major EB types: **Simplex (EBS), Junctional (JEB), Dystrophic (DEB), and Kindler syndrome**, and references newer reclassification (e.g., EBS suprabasal/basal; JEB generalized/localized; DEB recessive/dominant).
- Applies broadly across care contexts because EB pain is **acute, chronic, and recurrent**, and occurs across multiple body systems (skin, GI tract, musculoskeletal system, eyes).

**Key scope statement (verbatim/near-verbatim from the text):**
- “**The aim of the guidelines is to provide the user with information on pain care for children and adults with EB. These guidelines can be applied to all patients diagnosed with hereditary forms of EB. Patients with acquired forms are not included in the guidelines.**”

### Explicit exclusions (who is outside the target population)
- **Patients with acquired forms of EB** are **not included**.

---

## Target population segments (as the guideline is organized) + specific summaries

### 1) All EB patients (all ages/subtypes): pain and itch management across settings
**Population segment:**  
- **Any patient with hereditary EB** (any variant/subtype), **pediatric or adult**, experiencing **pain and/or itch**, in any care setting.

**Significant details from the guideline:**
- The guideline is intended for **practitioners of many disciplines** involved in EB care (multidisciplinary applicability).
- It emphasizes that EB pain is often **multi-factorial** and requires a **biopsychosocial approach** (medical + psychological + physical therapies).
- It recognizes that EB patients may experience **multiple painful events daily**, and that treating every event pharmacologically may cause **excess sedation**; therefore, care should be **individualized** with patient/family input and **periodically reviewed** as needs change.

---

### 2) EB patients with **acute pain** (focus: postoperative pain)
**Population segment:**  
- **Hereditary EB patients undergoing surgery** and needing **postoperative pain management** (children and adults).

**Significant details:**
- No EB-specific controlled trials for postoperative pain therapies; general pain principles apply with EB-specific modifications.
- Pain assessment tools vary by age/development:
  - **Numeric rating scales** for adults and children typically **> ~8 years** (developmentally able).
  - **FLACC** and **CHEOPS** for younger/nonverbal children.
- Analgesia is typically **multimodal** (opioids, NSAIDs when appropriate, acetaminophen; regional anesthesia when appropriate).
- Special consideration: many EB patients have **baseline chronic/recurrent opioid exposure**, so **tolerance** may require **higher doses**; baseline opioid use should be considered before adding postoperative dosing.
- Practical EB-specific issues: **skin fragility** affects regional anesthesia technique and device placement; **pseudosyndactyly** may limit ability to use PCA buttons.

---

### 3) EB patients with **chronic and recurrent pain**
**Population segment:**  
- **Hereditary EB patients** with **ongoing or repeatedly occurring pain**, including pain from routine care and multisystem complications.

**Sub-populations explicitly described by pain source:**
- **Skin and wound pain** (prominent complaint; wounds may be infected, heal poorly, scar)
- **Bathing and dressing changes** (major recurrent pain + anxiety trigger)
- **Gastrointestinal pain** (upper and lower GI complications; subtype-linked risks)
- **Musculoskeletal pain** (pseudosyndactyly, osteopenia/osteoporosis, fractures, back pain)
- **Eye pain** (e.g., corneal abrasions)

**Significant details:**
- The guideline highlights EB pain sources across organ systems, with major sources: **skin, GI tract, musculoskeletal system, eyes**.
- For chronic wound pain, systemic options mentioned include **NSAIDs, acetaminophen, tramadol, opioids**; neuropathic-quality pain may support considering agents like **gabapentin** (extrapolated evidence).
- For dressing changes/bathing: pain is often intertwined with **anxiety**, so management should address **both** using environmental, psychological, and pharmacologic approaches.

---

### 4) **Infants/neonates with EB** (special topic)
**Population segment:**  
- **Neonates/infants with hereditary EB**, including **severely affected hospitalized newborns**.

**Significant details:**
- In severe EB, pain can start **immediately** after birth; daily living activities require heightened care.
- Requires **regular pain assessment** using **validated neonatal pain scales** (example given: **PIPP**).
- Procedural pain and wound care require a **multidisciplinary team approach** for consistent pain control.
- Analgesics used can include **NSAIDs, acetaminophen, opioids** (with careful monitoring due to sedation/respiratory risk).
- **Codeine is not recommended** when alternatives exist (neonatal metabolism variability and safety concerns).
- Infants may uniquely benefit from **oral sucrose** for brief painful episodes.
- Emphasizes safe **holding/cuddling** with careful handling to prevent new lesions.

---

### 5) EB patients at **end of life / palliative phase** (special topic)
**Population segment:**  
- **Hereditary EB patients with life-limiting disease** requiring **palliative/end-of-life pain care** (includes adult and pediatric considerations).

**Significant details:**
- Palliative care addresses **physical, emotional, and spiritual suffering**, and includes **family support**.
- **Opioids** play a role; sustained-release oral opioids may be used when appropriate.
- If enteral route is not possible or rapid escalation is needed, **parenteral** routes may be required.
- Notes historical concern about **subcutaneous infusions** due to blistering risk, but reports tolerance in final days in at least one adult EB case.
- Breakthrough pain dosing protocols for children at end of life are not uniformly established; general international guidance exists.

---

### 6) EB patients with **pruritus (itch)** (special topic; not pain per se but major symptom)
**Population segment:**  
- **Children and adults with hereditary EB** experiencing **itch**, which contributes to suffering and can worsen skin damage and pain.

**Significant details:**
- Itch is described as **prominent, debilitating, and damaging**, and can lead to scratching → inflammation → more itch and skin breakdown (cycle).
- Management includes **environmental/behavioral**, **cognitive-behavioral**, and **pharmacologic** therapies.
- Pharmacologic options discussed include sedating and non-sedating **antihistamines**, and centrally acting agents (e.g., **gabapentin/pregabalin**, extrapolated from burn literature), plus other agents with sporadic success (e.g., **cyproheptadine, SSRIs**).

PMC4190576.txt,"The guideline is intended for **patients with inherited (hereditary) epidermolysis bullosa (EB)** of **any subtype** (EBS, JEB, DEB, Kindler syndrome) and **any age** (infants through adults). The document states one clear population-based exclusion:

## Explicit exclusion criterion (who cannot use it)
### 1) Patients with **acquired** epidermolysis bullosa
- The guideline **does not apply** to people with **acquired forms of EB** (commonly referred to as *epidermolysis bullosa acquisita*, an autoimmune blistering disease).
- The authors explicitly say: **“These guidelines can be applied to all patients diagnosed with hereditary forms of EB. Patients with acquired forms are not included in the guidelines.”**

**Why excluded:** acquired EB has a different cause (autoimmune), different disease course, and often different treatment priorities (for example, immunosuppression), so pain/itch management recommendations may not translate well.

## Important practical “non-eligibility” considerations (not formal exclusions, but situations where parts of the guideline may not be usable)
The paper doesn’t list additional formal exclusions, but it repeatedly notes circumstances where **specific interventions** may be inappropriate or need modification—meaning a patient might still be an EB patient covered by the guideline, but **cannot use certain components**:

### 2) Patients who cannot participate in certain psychological therapies
- Suitability depends on **developmental level, age, cognitive ability, and psychopathology**.
- Example: some CBT/hypnosis/biofeedback approaches may not be feasible in very young children or patients with significant cognitive impairment.

### 3) Patients for whom certain techniques are unsafe because of EB skin fragility
- Some modalities are effectively “excluded” for many EB patients due to skin injury risk:
  - **Adhesive-based sensors** for biofeedback are described as **relatively contraindicated** (because adhesives can tear skin).
  - Some integrative/manual therapies (for example, **massage/chiropractic**) are cautioned as potentially harmful given **skin fragility** and **osteopenia**.

### 4) Patients with clinical contraindications to specific drugs (general medical exclusions)
These are not EB-specific exclusions, but the guideline itself flags them:
- **NSAIDs/ketorolac**: avoid when **postoperative bleeding risk** is high or **renal function is abnormal**.
- **Codeine in neonates**: the guideline says **codeine is not recommended** when alternatives exist (unpredictable metabolism and response).
- **Methadone**: requires caution because titration can be unpredictable (long/variable half-life, protein binding), so some patients/settings may not be appropriate for its use.

## Bottom line
- **The only clear “cannot use this guideline” group is patients with *acquired* EB (EB acquisita).**
- Everyone with **inherited EB** is within scope, but **individual recommendations** may not be usable depending on age/development, skin fragility constraints, and standard medication contraindications.",painmg,exclusion_criteria_extraction
PMC5973958.txt,"## TARGET POPULATION (extracted from the provided guideline text)

### Primary target population (who the guideline is for)
- **Patients with neuropathic pain**—i.e., pain **“caused by a lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous system.”**
- The guideline is written for **clinical use (pharmacotherapy)** and is intended to support clinicians managing neuropathic pain in practice.

### What types/causes of neuropathic pain are included (scope of conditions)
The guideline states neuropathic pain can arise from a **heterogeneous group of disorders** affecting the **peripheral and central somatosensory nervous systems**, including:
- **Nutritional**
- **Metabolic**
- **Traumatic**
- **Ischemic**
- **Toxic**
- **Genetic**
- **Infectious**
- **Compression/entrapment**
- **Immune**
- **Neoplastic**
- **Neurodegenerative**  
These are presented as disease categories that can cause neuropathic pain.

### Explicit exclusions / out-of-scope population
The guideline explicitly excludes **acute pain associated with peripheral nerve inflammation** from the neuropathic pain category for the purpose of these recommendations:
- It notes controversy about whether acute peripheral nerve inflammation should be considered neuropathic pain.
- It gives examples of acute pain conditions involving direct peripheral nerve inflammation:
  - **Shingles in the acute phase**
  - **Radiculopathy due to intervertebral disc displacement**
- It concludes: **“in these guidelines, we would not include the acute pain associated with terminal nerve inflammation in the neuropathic pain category.”**

### Sub-populations specifically referenced (as examples or discussed groups)
These are not always framed as separate “target populations,” but they are clearly referenced as patient groups within the guideline’s discussion/evidence base:

1. **Patients with peripheral and/or central neuropathic pain (Japan context)**
   - The guideline highlights that **pregabalin** is approved in Japan for **both peripheral and central neuropathic pain**.

2. **Patients with post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN)**
   - Mentioned repeatedly as a neuropathic pain condition with evidence for:
     - **Pregabalin**
     - **ERV (extract from inflamed cutaneous tissue of rabbits inoculated with vaccinia virus)**—noted as effective **particularly for PHN in Japan** and approved for it.

3. **Patients with painful diabetic neuropathy / painful diabetic polyneuropathy**
   - Evidence cited for:
     - **Duloxetine** (pain/numbness associated with diabetic neuropathy)
     - **Tramadol** (painful diabetic polyneuropathy)
     - **Opioid analgesics** (including painful diabetic polyneuropathy)

4. **Cancer patients with neuropathic pain (epidemiology context)**
   - The guideline includes a clinical question about prevalence in **cancer patients** and notes cancer pain was systematically reviewed (mentioned as part of epidemiology background).

## Consolidated “TARGET POPULATION” statement (faithful to the provided text)
**These recommendations apply to patients experiencing neuropathic pain—defined as pain caused by a lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous system—arising from a wide range of peripheral or central nervous system disorders (e.g., metabolic, traumatic, infectious, compression/entrapment, immune, neoplastic, neurodegenerative causes). The guideline does not include acute pain associated with peripheral nerve inflammation (e.g., acute shingles pain or acute radiculopathy due to disc displacement) within the neuropathic pain category for the purposes of these recommendations.**

If you upload the original PDF/figure pages (or share the section that explicitly says “Target population”), I can extract the exact wording verbatim and format it exactly like your examples.",painmg,target_population_extraction
PMC5973958.txt,"The excerpt you provided does **not** contain a single, explicit “Exclusion criteria” section (i.e., it does not list a set of patient groups who “cannot use” the guideline overall). What it *does* state are several **scope limits** (who/what the guideline is *not intended for*) and **situations requiring special caution or different management**. Based on the text, the practical exclusions/limitations are:

## 1) Pain conditions the guideline does **not** classify as neuropathic pain (scope exclusion)
### Acute pain due to *peripheral nerve inflammation* in the acute phase
The guideline explicitly says it **does not include** certain acute pain states in the “neuropathic pain” category because it is difficult to determine how much of the acute pain is neuropathic vs nociceptive during the transition from acute to chronic:

- **Shingles in the acute phase** (acute herpetic pain; distinct from *post-herpetic neuralgia*, which *is* included)
- **Acute radiculopathy due to intervertebral disc displacement** (e.g., acute disc herniation–related radicular pain)

So, patients whose pain is primarily these **acute inflammatory nerve conditions** are, in effect, **outside the guideline’s target condition** (pharmacotherapy recommendations are not meant to be applied as “neuropathic pain” treatment in those acute settings).

## 2) Patients/contexts where the guideline’s drug recommendations may not be applicable because of **insurance/approval status in Japan**
The guideline notes that **some drugs listed are not covered by Japanese health insurance when used for neuropathic pain** and therefore should only be used after fully informing patients.

This is not a medical “cannot use,” but it is a **practical applicability limitation**:
- If a patient cannot access/afford off-label or non-covered therapy, the guideline’s listed options may not be usable as written.

## 3) Patients for whom certain recommended classes require **heightened risk management** (not absolute exclusion, but “not appropriate without safeguards”)
### Opioid analgesics (third-line)
When opioids are prescribed, the guideline recommends **ongoing evaluation for abuse or addiction**. Practically, this means the guideline’s opioid pathway is **not appropriate** in settings where:
- adequate monitoring for misuse/addiction cannot be performed, or
- the patient has high risk where safe prescribing/monitoring cannot be ensured.

(Your excerpt doesn’t list specific high-risk groups; it only states the need for continued evaluation.)

## 4) Treatments the guideline effectively says **should not be used as neuropathic-pain pharmacotherapy**
This is not “patients excluded,” but it is a **therapy exclusion** that affects who can be managed “by this guideline” if a clinician intends to rely on these drugs:

- The guideline **does not recommend NSAIDs or acetaminophen for neuropathic pain** due to lack of evidence of efficacy.
- It allows that NSAIDs *may* help when there is **mixed pain** (neuropathic pain plus nociceptive inflammatory pain), but not as neuropathic-pain–specific therapy.

## 5) Situations where the guideline implies you should move beyond stepwise pharmacotherapy
If patients **do not respond well** to stepwise pharmacotherapy, the guideline says **other treatment strategies should be considered** to improve ADL/QOL. This is not an exclusion, but it is a boundary: the guideline is not claiming pharmacotherapy alone is sufficient for all patients.

---

### Bottom line
From the provided text, the clearest “cannot use this guideline (as a neuropathic pain guideline)” group is:

- **Patients with acute pain from peripheral nerve inflammation**, specifically **acute shingles pain** and **acute disc-related radiculopathy**, because the guideline **does not include these acute conditions in the neuropathic pain category**.

PMC5785609.txt,"## TARGET POPULATION (extracted from the provided guideline text)

### Overall target population (who the guideline applies to)
- **Patients with cancer who experience pain**, including pain related to:
  - **The cancer itself** (e.g., tumor-related pain, metastatic pain)
  - **Cancer treatments** (e.g., chemotherapy/radiotherapy/surgery-related pain, treatment toxicity)
- The guideline is written to provide recommendations that can be applied by **healthcare professionals in clinical practice** to optimize **cancer pain management**.

**Key scope statement from the text (paraphrased closely):**
- Pain is highly prevalent in **patients with cancer**, and the document’s purpose is to establish recommendations for professionals to optimize **management of cancer-related pain**, including complex subtypes such as **breakthrough pain** and **neuropathic pain**.

If you upload the actual PDF/image of the guideline (or share the title/URL), I can also extract the **exact “Target population” section verbatim** (if it exists as a labeled heading) and distinguish it from broader “scope” language.",painmg,target_population_extraction
PMC5785609.txt,"The SEOM 2017 cancer pain guideline is written as a **general clinical practice guide for pain in patients with cancer**, not as a protocol with strict “inclusion/exclusion” rules. The paper does **not** list a formal set of exclusion criteria. Instead, it contains several **implicit “do not apply / do not use as written” situations** where the recommendations either don’t fit the patient population or require specialist modification.

Below are the main patient groups/situations in which this guideline **cannot be used directly** (or should only be used with specialist oversight), based on statements and scope cues in the text.

## 1) Patients without cancer-related pain (non‑cancer pain)
This guideline is intended for **cancer pain** (pain caused by the tumor, cancer treatments, or cancer-related complications). It is **not designed for**:
- chronic non-cancer pain syndromes (e.g., chronic low back pain not related to cancer)
- primary headache disorders, fibromyalgia, etc.

(While some drugs overlap, the risk/benefit framework—especially for opioids—differs.)

## 2) Patients in whom opioid recommendations are unsafe without individualized specialist management
The guideline supports opioids as a cornerstone for moderate–severe cancer pain, but it also flags situations where standard opioid use/rotation/titration is risky and therefore the guideline **should not be followed “by the book”**:

### a) Significant renal impairment (advanced kidney dysfunction)
- The guideline explicitly says **opioids should be used with caution in renal impairment**, and suggests buprenorphine as the safest option.
- Practical implication: patients with **moderate–severe renal failure** (or rapidly changing renal function) should not be managed using standard opioid choices/doses/conversions without adjustment and close monitoring.

### b) Significant hepatic impairment / complex drug–drug interactions
- Many opioids are metabolized in the liver (CYP/UGT pathways). In patients with **severe liver dysfunction** or heavy polypharmacy (CYP inhibitors/inducers), applying standard dosing/rotation tables can be unsafe.

### c) High arrhythmia risk if considering methadone
- The guideline warns methadone can cause **potentially fatal arrhythmias** and has unpredictable half-life.
- Practical exclusion: patients with **known QT prolongation, significant arrhythmia history, electrolyte instability, or interacting QT‑prolonging drugs** should not be treated per “methadone options” in the guideline unless managed by experienced clinicians with ECG monitoring.

## 3) Patients for whom opioid rotation cannot be safely performed (monitoring/experience not available)
This is one of the clearest “do not do this” statements:

- **Opioid rotation should be avoided if experience is not available or patient follow-up cannot be adequately monitored.**

So, patients in settings where you **cannot ensure close follow-up** (e.g., unreliable access, inability to reassess, poor monitoring capacity) are effectively **excluded from guideline-based opioid rotation** recommendations.

## 4) Patients in whom “breakthrough cancer pain” (BTCP) framework does not apply
The guideline’s BTCP approach assumes:
- **stable, controlled background pain** on around-the-clock analgesia

Therefore, patients with:
- **uncontrolled baseline pain** (no stable background analgesia yet)
- rapidly escalating pain without a stable regimen

…should not be labeled/managed as BTCP per this guideline until baseline pain is stabilized (otherwise you risk undertreating persistent pain by treating it as “breakthrough”).

## 5) Patients who require interventional techniques but are not appropriate candidates
The guideline recommends interventional options (nerve blocks, neuraxial infusions, vertebroplasty/kyphoplasty, ablation) for selected refractory cases, but these are **not universally applicable**. Patients may be “excluded” from these parts due to typical contraindications (not exhaustively listed in the text), such as:
- inability to tolerate procedures
- bleeding risk/anticoagulation issues (common in cancer care)
- infection at the site/systemic infection (relevant to neuraxial techniques)
- anatomy/tumor factors that make the procedure unsafe

In other words, those sections require **case-by-case specialist selection**, not blanket application.

## 6) Pediatric patients (children/adolescents)
The document is written around adult practice (e.g., adult dosing concepts, EMA approval statements for adult cancer patients). It does not present pediatric-specific dosing/algorithms. So children are **not an intended population** unless a pediatric oncology/pain team adapts it.

## 7) Patients at end-of-life with goals/constraints not addressed by the guideline
The guideline discusses hospitalized/ambulatory/end-of-life populations in prevalence discussions, but it is not a dedicated palliative sedation or last-days-of-life symptom control protocol. Patients needing:
- palliative sedation frameworks
- complex delirium/agitation management dominating care

…may need other, more specific guidance.

---

### Bottom line
There are **no explicit exclusion criteria list** in SEOM 2017, but you should not apply it straightforwardly (or you should substantially adapt it) in: **non-cancer pain**, **pediatrics**, **severe renal/hepatic dysfunction**, **high arrhythmia risk if methadone is considered**, **situations without capacity for close monitoring (especially opioid rotation)**, and **patients without stable baseline pain (BTCP framework doesn’t apply)**.

If you tell me the patient’s age group, cancer status, organ function (renal/hepatic), current opioids, and care setting (inpatient/outpatient), I can map which parts of the guideline are applicable vs. effectively “excluded.”",painmg,exclusion_criteria_extraction

However, the **applicable population is clearly described throughout the Introduction and scope statements**. Below is the target-population text **as stated (or directly implied) by the guideline**, segmented into distinct populations the recommendations address.

---

## 1) Patients with head and neck cancer needing palliative/supportive care (broad group)

**Extracted/grounded text (scope language):**
- “**Patients with head and neck cancer are a group in whom both specialist palliative and supportive care is especially appropriate whether the treatment intent is curative or not**…”
- “…since the disease and its treatments result in a huge burden of morbidity: short and long term – even lifelong for survivors.”
- “**All professionals caring for head and neck cancer patients should assess palliative and supportive care needs in initial treatment planning, and throughout the illness**…”

**Significant details (what this includes):**
- Applies to **head and neck cancer patients across the disease course**, including:
  - those on **curative-intent pathways** who still have major supportive/palliative needs
  - those with **advanced/recurrent/incurable disease** where the pathway may be palliative
- Recognizes frequent **comorbidities and psychosocial complexity**, e.g.:
  - “significant comorbidities, including **tobacco and alcohol dependence**, and complex psychosocial issues”
- Applies across care settings:
  - “in-patient, out-patient, day care, home care and telephone advice”

---

## 2) Patients with incurable / end-stage head and neck cancer (palliative-intent symptom control)

**Extracted/grounded text:**
- “**Incurable end-stage head and neck cancer leads to distressing symptoms.** Patients may remain active and self-caring while trying to cope with problems of **pain, swallowing, breathing and bleeding**.”
- “Radical treatment in advanced or recurrent head and neck cancer may be futile… therefore important decisions need to be made… The alternative… is a **palliative pathway**.”

**Significant details:**
- This population is characterized by **non-curative intent** and focus on:
  - symptom control (pain, bleeding, airway compromise, dysphagia, etc.)
  - quality of life and goals-of-care discussions
- Includes patients considered for **palliative surgery**, **palliative radiotherapy**, and/or **palliative chemotherapy**, where benefit–harm must be individualized.

---

## 3) “All palliative patients” with head and neck cancer (explicit subgroup used for swallowing guidance)

**Extracted/grounded text:**
- Recommendation: “**All palliative patients should have a functional endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES) assessment of swallow to assess for risk of aspiration.**”

**Significant details:**
- This subgroup is explicitly labeled “**all palliative patients**” (within head & neck cancer context).
- The guideline highlights that aspiration may be:
  - “silent in up to **40 per cent** of patients”
- Includes patients who:
  - can still take some oral intake (even with aspiration risk, depending on informed choice)
  - may require **enteral feeding** (NGT or gastrostomy), especially if oral intake is unsafe or inadequate

---

## 4) Patients with head and neck cancer who are dying / at end of life (terminal phase)

**Extracted/grounded text:**
- Section: “**Care of the dying**”
- “Dying patients may have significant and rapidly changing symptoms…”
- Recommendation: “**All patients at the end of life should have anticipatory medication available**… and should have an individualised care plan.”
- Recommendation: “**Cardiopulmonary resuscitation is inappropriate in the palliative dying patient.**”

**Significant details:**
- Applies when death is recognized as **imminent** and goals shift fully to comfort.
- Emphasizes:
  - stopping unnecessary medications, continuing essential symptom meds (often SC infusions/boluses)
  - “anticipatory prescribing” for common terminal symptoms: **pain, nausea/vomiting, agitation, secretions**
- Includes planning for preferred place of care (including home), and communication with family/carers.

---

## 5) Patients with suspected spinal metastases / metastatic cord compression (oncologic emergency within this population)

**Extracted/grounded text:**
- Recommendation: “**Patients with symptoms suggestive of spinal metastases or metastatic cord compression must be managed in accordance with the NICE guidance.**”
- Notes incidence context: spinal metastases in head and neck SCC “**less than 2 per cent**” but more common in thyroid cancer.

**Significant details:**
- This is a **symptom-triggered target subgroup** within head & neck cancer palliative care:
  - new/progressive back pain, neurological symptoms/signs, etc.
- Requires urgent assessment and management (MRI whole spine, steroids while arranging investigations/admission).

## Consolidated “Target Population” statement (faithful to the guideline’s scope)

**TARGET POPULATION (constructed from the guideline’s own scope wording):**  
Patients with **head and neck cancer** who require **palliative and supportive care**, including those receiving treatment with **curative intent** as well as those on a **palliative pathway** due to advanced/recurrent/incurable disease; and including patients in the **terminal (end-of-life/dying)** phase. The guideline also addresses specific palliative subgroups such as **palliative patients with dysphagia/aspiration risk** and those with symptoms suggestive of **spinal metastases/metastatic cord compression**.

PMC4873917.txt,"This UK National Multidisciplinary Guideline chapter is **not written with a narrow “eligible vs ineligible” patient population**, and it **does not state formal exclusion criteria** in the way a clinical trial or a drug protocol would. It is intended to guide **palliative and supportive care for people with head and neck cancer across the disease trajectory**, including when treatment intent is curative (supportive care needs) and when it is non-curative (palliative pathway).

That said, there are clear situations where the guideline (or parts of it) **should not be used as the primary guide**, or where **specific recommendations do not apply**:

## 1) Patients who do not have head and neck cancer (scope exclusion)
The document is specific to **head and neck cancer** patients (and the typical symptom burdens and interventions in that group). It is not meant to be a general palliative care guideline for:
- non–head and neck malignancies
- non-cancer palliative conditions (e.g., end-stage heart failure, COPD, dementia)

## 2) Patients who are not on a palliative/supportive-care pathway (partial exclusion)
Many sections are explicitly about **incurable/end-stage disease** and “care of the dying.” Those parts are not applicable to:
- patients receiving **radical curative treatment** who are not approaching end of life  
  (though they may still need *supportive care* elements like swallowing assessment, pain control, nutrition support)

So: **supportive-care components may still apply**, but **end-of-life/DNACPR/terminal airway event planning** sections may not.

## 3) Situations where another national guideline must take precedence
The chapter explicitly directs clinicians away from this document as the main guide in certain scenarios, e.g.:
- **Suspected spinal metastases or metastatic cord compression** → must be managed according to **NICE guidance** (this is effectively a “do not use this chapter as your main protocol” instruction for that condition).

## 4) Patients for whom specific interventions are clinically inappropriate (intervention-level exclusions)
The guideline repeatedly stresses **individual case assessment** and balancing benefit vs harm. So patients may be “excluded” from *particular recommendations* when risks outweigh benefits, for example:

### Palliative surgery / debulking / endovascular procedures
May be inappropriate in patients with:
- very poor performance status / frailty where operative morbidity is unacceptable
- anatomy/extent of disease where surgery will not meaningfully improve symptoms
- limited life expectancy where recovery time would consume most remaining life
- lack of local expertise/equipment (practical exclusion noted in airway palliation)

### Palliative radiotherapy (including re-irradiation)
May be inappropriate in patients with:
- inability to tolerate treatment positioning/immobilisation
- prior radiation where **re-irradiation toxicity risk** is unacceptably high
- very limited prognosis where treatment burden exceeds likely symptom benefit

### Palliative chemotherapy
May be inappropriate in patients with:
- poor functional status, major comorbidity, organ dysfunction
- high risk of toxicity where QoL would likely worsen
- patient preference against systemic therapy

## 5) Patients who cannot undergo a recommended assessment (practical/feasibility exclusions)
Example: the guideline recommends FEES for all palliative patients to assess aspiration risk, but in practice FEES may not be possible/appropriate if:
- the patient is too unstable or distressed to tolerate the procedure
- there is no access to FEES locally/urgently
- the patient declines the assessment

(That doesn’t “exclude” them from care—rather it limits applicability of that specific recommendation.)

## 6) DNACPR/CPR recommendations: not applicable to non-dying patients or reversible arrests
The guideline is explicit that:
- **CPR is inappropriate in the palliative dying patient** (so the “attempt CPR” pathway is excluded there)
But it also states CPR **may be appropriate** when:
- there is an **acute reversible illness** or treatable arrhythmia
- the patient is palliative overall but still has a **reasonable chance of successful CPR**

So the DNACPR recommendations are **not a blanket rule for all palliative head & neck cancer patients**; they are tied to prognosis and reversibility.

---

### Bottom line
- **No formal exclusion criteria are listed** because this is a service/clinical practice guideline chapter, not a trial protocol.
- The most defensible “cannot use” categories are:
  1) **not head & neck cancer**, and  
  2) **conditions explicitly redirected to other guidance (e.g., suspected cord compression → NICE)**, and  
  3) **intervention-specific inappropriateness** based on performance status, prognosis, comorbidity, feasibility, and patient wishes.

If you tell me whether you mean **exclusion from the whole guideline** vs **exclusion from specific recommendations (FEES, RT, surgery, chemo, DNACPR)**, I can rewrite this as a clean checklist for your protocol or audit tool.",painmg,exclusion_criteria_extraction
