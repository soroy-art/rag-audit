1,NICE guideline NG180,gpt5,"For an adult undergoing elective surgery, which type of intravenous fluid is recommended for intraoperative maintenance?",Intravenous crystalloid should be considered for intraoperative fluid maintenance.,"The guideline recommends using intravenous crystalloid for intraoperative maintenance. For resuscitation and routine maintenance strategies more broadly, follow the dedicated guideline on intravenous fluid therapy in adults in hospital.","Based on the provided context, the recommended type of intravenous fluid for intraoperative maintenance in adults undergoing elective surgery is **crystalloid**.

The evidence and guidelines within the context indicate:

1.  A small amount of evidence suggests a possible reduction in mortality with intravenous crystalloids compared to colloids.
2.  While crystalloids increase the risk of nausea and vomiting, the committee concluded that crystalloids should be considered for intraoperative fluid maintenance.
3.  Recommendation 1.4.3 specifically states: ""Consider using intravenous crystalloid for intraoperative fluid maintenance.""

Therefore, the guideline advises considering the use of intravenous crystalloids for this purpose.","[{'page_content': 'Intravenous fluids A small amount of evidence suggested a possible reduction in mortality when intravenous crystalloid, rather than colloid, is used for intraoperative fluid management.

Here's the explanation:

1.  **Cardiac Output Monitoring:** The context explicitly discusses cardiac output monitoring as a means to potentially assess and guide haemodynamic optimisation.
    *   Older evidence suggested it could reduce complications.
    *   More recent evidence (from one small study) also supported its use for this purpose.
    *   The NICE guideline (NG180) recommends considering cardiac output monitoring for people having major or complex surgery or high-risk surgery.
    *   The guideline on perioperative care (NG180) suggests using haemodynamic targets (like cardiac output) guided by monitoring for fluid management.
    *   The text states that achieving defined haemodynamic targets (implied to include cardiac output or related parameters) using fluids and/or vasoactive medications *did* significantly increase global blood flow, although it did not improve mortality.

Therefore, while the evidence quality is moderate to low and the approach isn't definitively stated as a broad best practice (due to heterogeneity), **cardiac output monitoring** is the specific modality highlighted in the context for intraoperative assessment and potential optimization of haemodynamics in major or complex surgery.","[{'page_content': 'In general, the administration of intravenous fluids should take into account the combined effects of aging, anesthetics, analgesics, and anxiolytics on physiology.

For conditions where surgery addresses the pain generator, the guideline advises post-op tapering, limited discharge quantities (typically 5, max 7 days), and active review to prevent persistent postoperative opioid use.","After a surgical procedure performed to treat pain (e.g., total knee arthroplasty for osteoarthritis), perioperative opioid de-escalation should be considered when the patient is opioid-tolerant (likely defined as requiring ≥60mg oral morphine equivalent [OME] for ≥7 days before surgery) and the surgery was intended to relieve pain (as stated in guideline section 7).

**How:**

1.  **Timing:** The de-escalation process ideally begins after the surgical procedure has provided pain relief. The discharge letter should explicitly outline the plan for any necessary further weaning of the pre-operative opioid analgesics, including the recommended dose, amount supplied, and planned duration of use (guideline sections 5, 6, and 7). This plan should be managed collaboratively between the hospital and primary care.
2.  **Method:** De-escalation involves a gradual reduction (tapering) of the opioid dose. This should be done carefully, considering the patient's individual needs and potential for withdrawal symptoms. Support from secondary care outpatient pain services or transitional pain services may be necessary if difficulties arise during the weaning process (guideline section 7).
3.  **Planning:** An individualized de-escalation plan should be formulated, potentially involving the Inpatient Pain Service during the perioperative period, especially for complex cases (guideline sections 4 and 10). The plan should consider the principles of multimodal analgesia and potentially use a reverse analgesic ladder approach (wean opioids first, then stop other analgesics like NSAIDs/adjuncts) once pain intensity decreases (guideline sections 3 and 10).
4.  **Communication:** Clear communication in the discharge letter is crucial, detailing the taper plan and providing advice for further weaning (guideline sections 5, 6, and 7).","[{'page_content': 'Additional recommendations for opioid tolerant patients De-escalation of opioids after pain relieving surgery: a.

13,CDC Guideline 2022,gpt5,Preoperative planning for an adult outpatient knee arthroplasty: What is the initial framework for deciding whether to prescribe opioids for postoperative pain?,"Use an individualized, evidence-based approach in which nonpharmacologic and nonopioid treatments are prioritized, and apply the guideline’s voluntary recommendations for opioid prescribing when needed for acute surgical pain.","The guidance provides voluntary recommendations for adults (≥18 years) with acute, subacute, and chronic pain, including surgical pain. It emphasizes access to nonpharmacologic and nonopioid options and individualized decision-making to reduce opioid-related harm. Rigid, one-size-fits-all rules are discouraged.","The initial framework for deciding whether to prescribe opioids for postoperative pain in an adult outpatient knee arthroplasty is based on a **collaborative, patient-centered approach** that emphasizes **judicious opioid use** and **opioid stewardship**. Here’s how it can be structured, based on the guidelines:

### 1. **Preoperative Assessment and Screening**
   - **Screen for chronic pain and opioid use**: All patients should be assessed for existing opioid use or chronic pain conditions before surgery. If high-dose opioids are involved, consult a pain specialist.
   - **Calculate Oral Morphine Equivalents (OME)**: Document the patient’s current opioid consumption (in morphine equivalents) to assess tolerance and guide perioperative management.

### 2. **Patient Education and Risk Communication**
   - **Discuss options and risks**: Inform patients about the benefits and risks of opioids, including potential for long-term use, addiction, and side effects. Emphasize the importance of tapering if opioids are used around the clock for more than a few days.
   - **Set realistic expectations**: Explain the likely impact of surgery on pain and outline discharge plans, including tapering if opioids are prescribed.

### 3. **Multimodal Analgesia**
   - **Avoid opioid-only regimens**: Whenever possible, use a multimodal approach combining non-opioid analgesics (e.g., paracetamol, NSAIDs) to reduce the need for opioids.
   - **Prehabilitation**: Optimize preoperative pain management, including psychological support if needed, to reduce postoperative pain severity.

### 4. **Consider Specialist Input**
   - For patients with complex pain needs or high opioid tolerance, consult a pain specialist to develop a tailored plan.

### 5. **Minimize Opioid Prescription**
   - Prescribe the lowest effective dose of opioids for the shortest duration possible. Provide clear discharge instructions, including tapering plans, and coordinate with primary care for ongoing management.

### Key Principles:
- **Opioid stewardship**: Use opioids only when necessary, and taper them promptly as pain improves.
- **Patient involvement**: Involve patients in decisions, ensuring they understand risks and alternatives.
- **Prevention of misuse**: Identify risk factors (e.g., history of substance use, mental health issues) and provide appropriate support.

This framework ensures a balanced, evidence-based approach to postoperative pain management, minimizing opioid-related risks while addressing patient needs.","[{'page_content': 'and expectation management regarding opioid use and perioperative pain management  [18] .

14,CDC Guideline 2022,gpt5,A patient recovering from surgery has been using short-term opioids and asks about stopping: How should tapering be approached?,"Taper collaboratively and avoid rapid, noncollaborative tapering, especially in patients who are stable on their current dose.",The guideline cautions against rapid or noncollaborative tapering and against dismissing patients from care. Taper plans should be individualized and patient-centered to minimize harm.,"Okay, based on the provided context, here's how tapering should generally be approached for a patient recovering from surgery who has been using short-term opioids:

1.  **Assess Opioid Tolerance (Crucial Distinction):** The approach depends heavily on whether the patient is considered ""opioid-tolerant."" This typically means they have been on opioid therapy for a significant period (often considered ≥1-2 weeks, but the exact definition can vary). The provided context specifically mentions opioid-tolerant patients. For a patient with *short-term* use, they may not be tolerant.

2.  **Tapering Rate (General Guideline for Non-Tolerant/Short-Term Use):** While the context emphasizes tapering for longer-term users, it does provide guidance for patients who have been on opioids continuously for ≥1 week but <1 month (which could overlap with short-term use around surgery).
    *   For this group, a **slower taper** is often recommended to minimize withdrawal symptoms. The guideline suggests potentially reducing the daily dosage by approximately **20% every 2 days** (or perhaps a slightly slower rate like 10-20% per week, as mentioned later for longer use). This rate is considered suitable for successful tapering post-surgery.

3.  **Predict Based on Pre-Surgery Dose:** The discharge opioid dosage and the dosage *before* discharge can help predict the tapering needs. A higher pre-discharge dose might require a slower taper.

4.  **Individualization is Key:** Regardless of the initial taper rate suggestion, the taper must be **individualized**. Factors include the specific opioid dose, duration of use (even if short-term pre-surgery), the patient's overall health, functional status, goals for opioid use, and potential for non-opioid pain management.

5.  **Collaborative Planning:** The tapering plan should be discussed thoroughly with the patient *before* discharge and coordinated with their outpatient care team (e.g., primary care physician, specialist, or pain service).

6.  **Monitor for Symptoms:** Patients must be counseled about potential **withdrawal symptoms** (anxiety, insomnia, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, etc.) and **worsening pain**, which can sometimes mimic withdrawal or be related to underlying issues. Frequent follow-up (at least monthly) is important.

7.  **Goal Setting:** Goals for the taper should be established collaboratively. This could range from simply reducing the dose further to discontinuing opioids entirely, depending on the patient's needs and risks.

**In summary:**

For a patient recovering from surgery and tapering short-term opioid use, the approach should generally involve a **slower taper rate** (e.g., around 20% reduction every 2-3 days initially, though individualization is crucial) to minimize withdrawal symptoms. This plan should be discussed with the patient before discharge, be individualized based on their specific situation and pre-surgery dose, and be coordinated with their outpatient care. Close monitoring for withdrawal symptoms and any return of pain or other issues is essential. The specific rate and duration will depend on the patient's unique circumstances, including the length of their prior opioid use (if any beyond the immediate post-op period) and their goals for continued or discontinued opioid therapy.

**Important Note:** This information is based on the provided context. A healthcare professional should provide personalized medical advice for the specific patient.","[{'page_content': 'Additional recommendations for opioid tolerant patients De-escalation of opioids after pain relieving surgery: a.

17,CDC Guideline 2022,gpt5,Are inflexible policies on opioid dose or duration recommended for postoperative pain? ,No. Inflexible dose/duration policies are considered misapplication of the guideline. ,"The document cautions against rigid rules (e.g., fixed day or dose limits), rapid noncollaborative tapering, or dismissing patients from care; instead, it promotes individualized practice.","No, the guidelines provided do **not** recommend inflexible policies on opioid dose or duration for postoperative pain.

Here's the explanation based on the context:

1.  **Emphasis on Individualization:** The text explicitly states that opioid durations should be ""individualized based on the patient's clinical circumstances"" (first paragraph). This directly contradicts the idea of rigid, one-size-fits-all policies.
2.  **Focus on Principles over Specific Numbers:** The context discusses how guidelines like the CDC avoid including specific prescription dosages and durations in their summary recommendations. This is done to prevent misapplication as inflexible rules and to allow clinicians to weigh benefits and risks for individual patients (section discussing CDC insights). Instead, they focus on general principles.
3.  **Caution Against Over-Prescribing (Just In Case):** There's guidance against prescribing additional opioids just in case pain lasts longer than expected (first paragraph). This suggests caution against overly prescriptive duration recommendations, but it still emphasizes clinical judgment based on the patient's situation.
4.  **Context for Use:** Recommendations are often provided within specific contexts (e.g., for postoperative pain, for opioid-tolerant patients, for different types of surgery) but still encourage tailoring to the individual patient's needs and response to pain.

Therefore, the provided guidelines advocate for clinical flexibility and individualization in opioid prescribing decisions for postoperative pain, rather than recommending inflexible policies on dose or duration.","[{'page_content': ""causes of nonsurgical acute pain, and limiting the duration of opioid therapy can minimize the need to taper to prevent withdrawal symptoms at the end of the course of opioids and limit unused opioids. Certain circumstances (e.g., severe traumatic injuries) might require use of opioids for durations of >7 days. Durations should be individualized based on the patient's clinical circumstances. When patients are discharged from the hospital after surgery, the course and dosage of any opioid medications administered during hospitalization and before discharge can help predict ongoing pain management needs  (150, 256, 257) . For postoperative pain, procedure-specific opioid prescribing recommendations are available with ranges for amounts of opioids needed (on the basis of use and refills and on consensus)  (149, 151, 250) .
