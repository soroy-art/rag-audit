<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction Background</head><p>In 2015 it was estimated that there were approximately 71 million individuals chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) worldwide, 1,2 many of whom were unaware of their infection. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">3</ref> HCV infection remains one of the main causes of chronic liver disease worldwide. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">4</ref> The long-term natural history of HCV infection is highly variable: the hepatic injury can range from minimal necro-inflammatory changes to extensive fibrosis and cirrhosis with or without hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Clinical care for patients with HCV-related liver disease has advanced considerably during the last couple of decades, thanks to an enhanced understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease, and because of developments in diagnostic procedures and radical improvements in therapy and prevention.</p><p>The primary goal of HCV therapy is to cure the infection, i.e. to achieve a sustained virological response (SVR) defined as undetectable HCV RNA after treatment completion. An SVR corresponds to a cure of the HCV infection, as late relapse occurs in less than 0.2% of cases beyond 6 months of followup. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">5</ref> An SVR is generally associated with normalisation of liver enzymes and improvement or regression of liver necroinflammation and fibrosis, and improvement in liver function. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref> The risk of HCC and liver-related mortality is significantly reduced, but not eliminated, in patients with cirrhosis who clear HCV compared to untreated patients and non-sustained virological responders, especially in the presence of cofactors of liver morbidity, such as the metabolic syndrome, harmful alcohol consumption and/or concurrent hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref> HCV is also associated with a number of extrahepatic manifestations, but viral elimination can reduce allcause mortality. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref> This final update of the EASL Recommendations on Treatment of Hepatitis C series started in 2014 is intended to assist physicians and other healthcare providers, as well as patients and other interested individuals, in the clinical decisionmaking process, by describing the current optimal management of patients with acute and chronic HCV infections. These recommendations apply to therapies that have been approved by the European Medicines Agency and other national European agencies at the time of their publication. The panel recognises the heterogeneity of per capita incomes, health insurance systems and drug prices in different regions, and therefore the constraints that apply to access to branded and generic drugs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methodology</head><p>These EASL recommendations have been prepared by a panel of experts chosen by the EASL Governing Board. The recommendations are primarily based on evidence from existing publications and presentations at international meetings. In the absence of such evidence, the experts' personal experiences and opinions have been considered. The evidence and recommendations have been graded according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26</ref> The strength of recommendations reflects the quality of underlying evidence. The quality of the evidence in the recommendations has been classified into 1 of 3 levels: high (A), moderate (B) or low (C). The GRADE system offers 2 grades of recommendation: strong (1) or weak (2) (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). Thus, these recommendations consider the quality of evidence: the higher the quality of evidence, the more likely a strong recommendation is warranted; the greater the variability in values and preferences, or the greater the uncertainty, the more likely a weaker recommendation is warranted. The recommendations have been approved by the EASL Governing Board.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Available drugs in Europe</head><p>The HCV drug combinations available in Europe are listed in this paragraph and in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>. Their known pharmacokinetic and safety profiles are presented.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sofosbuvir</head><p>Sofosbuvir should be administered at the dose of 400 mg (1 tablet) once per day, with or without food.</p><p>Approximately 80% of sofosbuvir is renally excreted, whereas 15% is excreted in faeces. The majority of the sofosbuvir dose recovered in urine is the dephosphorylationderived nucleoside metabolite GS-331007 (78%), while 3.5% is recovered as sofosbuvir. Renal clearance is the major elimination pathway for GS-331007, with a large part actively secreted. No dose adjustment of sofosbuvir is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Sofosbuvircontaining regimens were shown to be safe in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment, including those with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt;30 ml/min/1.73 m 2 and those with end-stage renal disease requiring haemodialysis, with or without hepatic decompensation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27</ref> A recent study has confirmed the safety of sofosbuvir in patients with stage 4-5 kidney disease who were not on dialysis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28</ref> Sofosbuvir exposure is not significantly changed in patients with mild liver impairment (Child-Pugh A cirrhosis), but it is increased 2.3-fold in those with moderate liver impairment (Child-Pugh B cirrhosis).</p><p>Sofosbuvir is well tolerated over 12 to 24 weeks of administration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir</head><p>Sofosbuvir and velpatasvir are available in a two-drug fixed-dose combination containing 400 mg of sofosbuvir and 100 mg of velpatasvir in a single tablet. The recommended dose of the combination is 1 tablet taken orally once daily with or without food.</p><p>Velpatasvir is metabolised in vitro by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2B6, CYP2C8 and CYP3A4. However, because of the slow turnover, the vast majority of drug in plasma is the parent drug. Importantly, velpatasvir is transported by P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) and, to a limited extent, by organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1. Biliary excretion of the parent drug is the major route of elimination. The median terminal half-life of velpatasvir following administration of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir is approximately 15 hours.</p><p>Velpatasvir plasma exposure (area under curve, AUC) is similar in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B and C cirrhosis, respectively) compared to those with normal hepatic function. Cirrhosis, including decompensated cirrhosis, had no clinically relevant effect on velpatasvir exposure in a population-level pharmacokinetic analysis in HCVinfected individuals. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29</ref> The pharmacokinetics of velpatasvir have been studied in HCV-negative patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR &lt;30 ml/min/1.73 m 2 ). Relative to individuals with normal renal function, the AUC of velpatasvir was 50% higher, which was not considered to be clinically relevant. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30</ref> Treatment with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for 12 weeks was reported to be safe in patients with end-stage renal disease undergoing haemodialysis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">31</ref> The safety assessment of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir was based on pooled phase III and real-world data. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">33</ref> Headache, fatigue and nausea were the most commonly reported adverse events, at a similar frequency to placebo-treated patients.</p><p>Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir Sofosbuvir, velpatasvir and voxilaprevir are available in a threedrug fixed-dose combination containing 400 mg of sofosbuvir, 100 mg of velpatasvir and 100 mg of voxilaprevir in a single tablet. The recommended dose of the combination is 1 tablet taken orally once daily with food, as voxilaprevir plasma exposure (AUC) and maximum concentration (C max ) were 112% to 435%, and 147% to 680% higher, respectively, in the presence of food. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34</ref> Voxilaprevir is metabolised in vitro by CYP3A4, with the vast majority of drug in plasma being the parent drug. Velpatasvir and voxilaprevir are both inhibitors of drug transporters P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. Biliary excretion of the parent drug is the major route of elimination for voxilaprevir. The median terminal half-life of voxilaprevir following administration of sofosbuvir, velpatasvir and voxilaprevir is approximately 33 hours.</p><p>Population pharmacokinetic analysis of voxilaprevir in HCVinfected patients indicated that patients with compensated (Child-Pugh A) cirrhosis had 73% higher exposure to voxilaprevir than those without cirrhosis. Thus, no dose adjustment of sofosbuvir, velpatasvir and voxilaprevir is required for patients with compensated (Child-Pugh A) cirrhosis. The pharmacokinetics of single-dose voxilaprevir were also studied in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B and C cirrhosis, respectively). Relative to patients with normal hepatic function, the voxilaprevir AUC was 3-fold and 5-fold higher in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment, respectively. Thus, the combination of sofosbuvir, velpatasvir and voxilaprevir should not be used in patients with Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. Evidence grading used (adapted from the GRADE system).</p></div>

Any change of estimate is uncertain C</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recommendation Notes Grading</head><p>Strong Factors influencing the strength of the recommendation included the quality of the evidence, presumed patient-important outcomes, and cost 1 Weak Variability in preferences and values, or more uncertainty. Recommendation is made with less certainty, higher cost or resource consumption moderate (Child-Pugh B) or severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment.</p><p>The pharmacokinetics of voxilaprevir have been studied in HCV-negative patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR &lt;30 ml/min/1.73 m 2 ). Relative to patients with normal renal function, the AUC of voxilaprevir was 71% higher in those with severe renal impairment, which was not considered to be clinically relevant.</p><p>The safety data of sofosbuvir, velpatasvir and voxilaprevir was based on data from phase II and III clinical trials and real-world studies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[39]</ref> Headache, diarrhoea and nausea were the most commonly reported adverse events. The incidence of gastrointestinal side effects was greater than with the combination of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir alone.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir</head><p>Glecaprevir and pibrentasvir are available in a two-drug fixeddose combination containing 100 mg of glecaprevir and 40 mg of pibrentasvir. The recommended dose is 3 tablets taken orally once daily with food, as glecaprevir plasma exposure increases 83%-163% in the presence of food compared to the fasted state.</p><p>Biliary excretion is the major route of elimination for both glecaprevir and pibrentasvir. Their half-lives are approximately 6 and 23 hours, respectively.</p><p>Population-level pharmacokinetic analysis in HCV-infected individuals showed that following administration of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir in HCV-infected patients with compensated (Child-Pugh A) cirrhosis, exposure to glecaprevir was approximately 2-fold higher whilst pibrentasvir exposure was similar to that in patients without cirrhosis. When compared to patients with normal hepatic function, the AUC of glecaprevir was 33% higher in patients with compensated (Child-Pugh A) cirrhosis, 100% higher in those with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B cirrhosis), and increased to 11-fold in those with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C cirrhosis). Thus, glecaprevir/ pibrentasvir should not be used in patients with Child-Pugh B or C cirrhosis.</p><p>Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir was studied in HCV-negative individuals with mild, moderate, severe, or end-stage renal impairment not on dialysis and compared to those with normal renal function. AUCs were increased by less than 56% in all patients with any stage of renal disease, which was not clinically significant. The AUC of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir was also similar in patients on dialysis; thus, this combination can be recommended in patients with mild, moderate, severe and end-stage renal impairment. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">40</ref> The safety of pibrentasvir and glecaprevir was evaluated in phase II and III clinical trials and real-world studies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[44]</ref> Headache and fatigue were the most commonly reported adverse events.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grazoprevir/elbasvir</head><p>Grazoprevir and elbasvir are available in a two-drug fixed-dose combination containing 100 mg of grazoprevir and 50 mg of elbasvir in a single tablet. The recommended dose of the combination is 1 tablet taken orally once daily with or without food.</p><p>Grazoprevir and elbasvir are partially metabolised by CYP3A4, but no circulating metabolites are detected in plasma. The principal route of elimination is biliary and faecal, with &lt;1% recovered in urine. Grazoprevir is transported by P-gp and OATP1B1, while elbasvir is a substrate for P-gp. Both elbasvir (&gt;99.9%) and grazoprevir (98.8%) are extensively bound to plasma proteins. The terminal half-life values are approximately 24 and 31 hours, respectively. Pharmacokinetic data from hepatic impairment studies in non-HCV-infected individuals have demonstrated a decrease in the AUC of elbasvir in patients with Child-Pugh A (40%), Child-Pugh B (28%) and Child-Pugh C (12%) cirrhosis. In contrast, grazoprevir exposure is increased in Child-Pugh A (70%), Child-Pugh B (5-fold) and Child-Pugh C (12-fold) cirrhosis. Based on these data, elbasvir/grazoprevir should not be used in patients with decompensated (Child-Pugh B or C) cirrhosis. <ref type="bibr">45</ref> No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment (including patients on haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis). There is an increase in elbasvir (65%) and grazoprevir (86%) exposure in non-HCV-infected individuals with an eGFR &lt;30 ml/min/1.73 m 2 , but this is not considered to be clinically significant.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">2</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Diagnosis of recently acquired hepatitis C, chronic hepatitis C and HCV reinfection</head><p>Anti-HCV antibodies are detectable in serum or plasma by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) in the vast majority of patients with HCV infection, but may be undetectable in the early phase of acute infection and in patients with chronic hepatitis C who are profoundly immunosuppressed. Following spontaneous or treatment-induced viral clearance, anti-HCV antibodies persist in the absence of HCV RNA, but titres may wane and finally disappear in some individuals. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref> Anti-HCV antibody testing is not helpful to determine reinfection after treatment, as the antibodies are already present before reinfection in the vast majority of cases.</p><p>The diagnosis of recently acquired and chronic HCV infection is based on the detection of HCV RNA in serum or plasma by a sensitive, exclusively qualitative or both qualitative and quantitative molecular method. An assay with a lower limit of detection &lt; -15 IU/ml is recommended. However, the vast majority of patients with an indication for anti-HCV therapy have an HCV RNA level above 50,000 IU/ml. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55</ref> There is an important need for affordable (less than US$5-US$10) point-of-care or near-care nucleic acid testing assays to ascertain viraemia, which would be applicable for large-scale diagnosis where sensitive HCV RNA assays are not available and/or not affordable, i.e. in low-to middle-income areas, as well as in specific settings in highincome countries. For widespread population testing, a qualitative HCV RNA assay needs only to have a lower limit of detection &lt; -1,000 IU/ml (3.0 Log 10 IU/ml). In such settings, the low incidence of a false-negative test for viraemia with these assays is outweighed by the benefit of scaling up access to diagnosis and care. Indeed, a study in patients with chronic hepatitis C due to HCV genotype 1 found only 4 patients out of 2,472 (0.16%) with an HCV RNA level below 1,000 IU/ml. <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56</ref> In a report from the Swiss Hepatitis C Cohort, 88 out of 2,533 (3.5%) treatment-naïve patients with chronic hepatitis C and available quantitative HCV RNA testing results ever had an HCV RNA level less than or equal to 1,000 IU/ml. <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57</ref> Young age, excessive alcohol consumption and absence of intravenous drug use were independently associated with an HCV RNA level &lt; -1,000 IU/ml.

Whole blood sampled on DBSs can be used as an alternative to serum or plasma obtained by venipuncture for anti-HCV antibody testing, after shipment to a central laboratory where the EIA will be performed (A1). Rapid diagnostic tests using serum, plasma, fingerstick whole blood or crevicular fluid (saliva) as matrices can be used instead of classical EIAs as point-of-care tests to facilitate anti-HCV antibody screening and improve access to care (A1). If anti-HCV antibodies are detected, the presence of HCV RNA by molecular assay or HCV core antigen by EIA in serum or plasma should be determined to identify patients with viraemia (A1). Whole blood sampled on DBSs can be used as an alternative to serum or plasma obtained by venipuncture for HCV RNA testing, after shipment to a central laboratory where the molecular test will be performed (A1). Whole blood sampled on DBSs should not be used as an alternative to serum or plasma obtained by venipuncture for HCV core antigen testing, as a substantial proportion of viraemic patients will be missed due to insufficient sensitivity (B1). Reflex testing for HCV RNA or HCV core antigen in patients found to be anti-HCV antibody-positive should be applied to shorten pathways to care (A1). Anti-HCV antibody screening for HCV infection can be replaced by low-cost point-of-care tests for viraemia with a lower limit of detection &lt; -1,000 IU/ml (3.0 Log 10 IU/ml) or for HCV core antigen testing when such tests are available, if less costly than anti-HCV antibody testing in low-incidence populations (C2).</p><p>HCV core antigen in serum or plasma by enzyme immunoassay is a marker of HCV replication that can be used as an alternative to HCV RNA to diagnose HCV viraemia (A1).

Migrants from countries where distinct, less treatmentsusceptible HCV subtypes are known to be prevalent may benefit from determination of genotype and subtype by means of population or deep sequencing of the NS5B or another coding region followed by phylogenetic analysis, to identify HCV subtypes inherently resistant to NS5A inhibitors (such as subtypes 1l, 4r, 3b, 3g, 6u, 6v and other undetermined subtypes) in order to avoid treatment failure (B1). In geographical areas or settings where HCV subtypes inherently resistant to NS5A inhibitors (such as subtypes 1l, 4r, 3b, 3g, 6u, 6v and other undetermined subtypes) are present, the HCV genotype and subtype should be determined whenever possible by means of population or deep sequencing of the NS5B or another coding region followed by phylogenetic analysis (but population or deep sequencing methods are not available for patients in most low-and middle-income countries where these HCV subtypes are present) (B2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recommendations</head><p>Testing for HCV resistance prior to first-line treatment is not recommended (A1). In areas where only regimens that require optimisation based on pre-treatment resistance testing are available, and physicians have easy access to a reliable test that evaluates HCV resistance to NS5A inhibitors (spanning amino acids 24 to 93), these analyses can guide decisions, as specified in the 2016 version of the EASL Recommendations on Treatment of Hepatitis C (B2). therapeutic effect. Thus, sofosbuvir should not be administered with known inducers of P-gp, such as rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin or St John's wort. Other potential interactions may occur with moderate inducers such as rifabutin, oxcarbazepine, rifapentine and modafinil. No significant drugdrug interactions have been reported in studies with the antiretroviral agents emtricitabine, tenofovir, rilpivirine, efavirenz, darunavir/ritonavir and raltegravir, and there are no potential drug-drug interactions with other antiretroviral drugs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">121</ref> Sofosbuvir-based regimens are contraindicated in patients treated with the anti-arrhythmic amiodarone because of the risk of life-threatening arrhythmias. Bradycardia has been observed within hours to days of starting the DAA, but cases have been observed up to 2 weeks after initiating HCV treatment. A number of potential mechanisms have been proposed involving P-gp inhibition, protein binding displacement and direct effects of sofosbuvir and/or other DAAs on cardiomyocytes or ion channels. Toxicity is likely the result of a combination of mechanisms. Because of the long half-life of amiodarone, an interaction is possible for several months after discontinuation of amiodarone. If the patient has no cardiac pacemaker in situ, waiting 3 months after discontinuing amiodarone before starting a sofosbuvir-based regimen is recommended. Sofosbuvir-containing regimens have also been implicated in cardiac toxicity in the absence of amiodarone, but this remains controversial. In the absence of specific drug-drug interaction data, caution should be exercised with antiarrhythmics other than amiodarone. <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">122</ref> Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir Drugs that are potent P-gp or potent CYP inducers (e.g., rifampicin, rifabutin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, St John's wort) are contraindicated, because of the decrease in sofosbuvir and/or velpatasvir exposure with a potential loss in efficacy. However, there are also drugs that are moderate P-gp or CYP inducers (such as modafinil) which can reduce velpatasvir exposure. Currently, this combination would not be recommended with sofosbuvir and velpatasvir.</p><p>There is an increase in exposure of co-medications that are substrates for P-gp and/or BCRP with velpatasvir.

Efavirenz causes a 50% decrease in velpatasvir exposure. Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir also increases tenofovir exposure by inhibiting P-gp.

Dabigatran is contraindicated because of a near 3-fold increase in AUC. This is caused by P-gp inhibition by both velpatasvir and voxilaprevir. Other substrates of P-gp may need to be dose-adjusted or monitored for increased exposure, including digoxin, ticagrelor and carvedilol. Similar caution is required with OATP1B inhibitors, such as cyclosporin, as voxilaprevir plasma exposure increases 19-fold, or with OATP1B substrates, such as edoxaban, as voxilaprevir inhibition is expected to increase exposure to the factor Xa inhibitor. Neither of these combinations are recommended.</p><p>Concomitant use with medicinal products that are strong P-gp and/or strong CYP inducers, such as rifampicin, rifabutin, St John's wort, carbamazepine, phenobarbital or phenytoin, are contraindicated due to the decrease in sofosbuvir, velpatasvir and/or voxilaprevir exposure with the potential loss in efficacy.

Strong inhibitors of CYP3A (e.g. boosted protease inhibitors, some azole antifungals), which may markedly increase plasma concentrations, are either contraindicated or not recommended. In addition to inhibition of CYP3A, grazoprevir plasma concentrations may also be markedly increased by inhibitors of OATP1B1 (including boosted protease inhibitors, cobicistat, cyclosporin, single-dose rifampicin).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recommendations</head><p>Because of their virological efficacy, ease of use, safety and tolerability, IFN-free, ribavirin-free, pangenotypic DAA-based regimens are preferred in HCV-infected patients without cirrhosis or with compensated (Child-Pugh A) cirrhosis, including "treatment-naïve" patients (defined as patients who have never been treated for their HCV infection) and "treatment-experienced" patients (defined as patients who were previously treated with pegylated IFN-a and ribavirin; or pegylated IFN-a, ribavirin and sofosbuvir; or sofosbuvir and ribavirin) (A1).</p><p>The following pangenotypic regimens are recommended for the treatment of patients infected with HCV, according to the below recommendations (A1):</p><p>the fixed-dose combination of sofosbuvir (400 mg) and velpatasvir (100 mg) in a single tablet administered once daily; the fixed-dose combination of glecaprevir (300 mg) and pibrentasvir (120 mg) in 3 tablets containing 100 mg of glecaprevir and 40 mg of pibrentasvir, administered once daily with food; the fixed-dose combination of sofosbuvir (400 mg), velpatasvir (100 mg) and voxilaprevir (100 mg) in a single tablet administered once daily with food.</p><p>Simplified, genotyping/subtyping-free treatment of chronic hepatitis C with pangenotypic drug regimens in patients without cirrhosis or with compensated (Child-Pugh A) cirrhosis Improving access to anti-HCV therapy has become a worldwide priority. Many obstacles remain that reduce the global benefit of HCV treatment, including the numbers of infected individuals, the cost of diagnostic tests, the amount of information needed to inform treatment decisions, and the relative complexity of treatment strategies based on genotype. Thus, wherever genotype/subtype determination is not available, not affordable and/ or limits access to HCV care, simplified treatment without knowledge of the HCV genotype and subtype should be used to facilitate the cascade of care. Populations who are historically less engaged in healthcare, such as PWIDs, prisoners, homeless individuals, migrants, people living in rural communities with poor access to care, patients struggling with mental health or substance use disorders, men who have sex with men, sex workers, or indigenous populations are those who will benefit more from a streamlined care pathway. The only information needed to start treatment with either sofosbuvir/velpatasvir or glecaprevir/pibrentasvir in patients without cirrhosis or with compensated (Child-Pugh A) cirrhosis, including treatment-naïve or treatment-experienced patients (as defined above), is the presence of HCV replication (as assessed by HCV RNA or HCV core antigen testing, as described above) and possible drug-drug interactions. The presence of advanced fibrosis (F3) or cirrhosis (F4) must be checked prior to therapy as it will determine the duration of treatment (8 or 12 weeks) with certain HCV genotypes and regimens, and whether the patient needs post-treatment surveillance for HCC, provided that treatment for HCC is available. A simple non-invasive marker score, such as FIB-4 or APRI, can be used for that purpose (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">3</ref>). If this information is not available, a universal duration of 12 weeks is recommended, regardless of the treatment regimen used. Lower SVR12 rates may be achieved in patients infected with HCV genotype 3 and compensated (Child-Pugh A) cirrhosis than in other patients, but efficacious retreatment strategies exist in individuals with virological failure.</p><p>The following simplified treatment recommendations are summarised in Table <ref type="table">6A</ref>.</p></div>

The same IFN-free, ribavirin-free treatment regimens should be used in HIV-coinfected patients as in patients without HIV infection, because the virological results of therapy are identical (A1). In HIV-coinfected patients, treatment alterations or dose adjustments should be performed in case of interactions with antiretroviral drugs (A1).</p><p>In settings where none of the IFN-free, ribavirin-free options proposed in this document are available, options proposed in previous versions of these recommendations remain acceptable for patients likely to respond to these regimens until pangenotypic DAA regimens become available and affordable (A1).

In low-and middle-income countries where the IFN-free, ribavirin-free options proposed in this document are not available and/or not affordable, the pangenotypic combination of generic sofosbuvir and generic daclatasvir is safe, highly efficacious and affordable, and should be used according to the 2016 EASL Recommendations on Treatment of Hepatitis C (A1). In patients with advanced fibrosis (F3) or compensated (Child-Pugh A) cirrhosis (F4), post-SVR surveillance for the diagnosis of HCC and linkage to care must be provided when treatment for HCC is available (A1).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recommendations</head><p>Simplified, genotyping/subtyping-free, pangenotypic anti-HCV treatment must be used to improve access to HCV treatment and increase the global infection cure rates in any setting where genotype and subtype determination is not available, not affordable and/or would limit access to therapy (A1). Pre-treatment assessment can be limited to proof of HCV viraemia (presence of HCV RNA or HCV core antigen) and determination of the presence or absence of cirrhosis by a non-invasive method (A1). Possible drug-drug interactions should be carefully checked and dose modifications implemented when necessary (A1). Treatment-naïve patients without cirrhosis or with compensated (Child-Pugh A) cirrhosis and treatmentexperienced patients without cirrhosis should be treated without testing genotype/subtype with either: (i) the fixed-dose combination of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir for 12 weeks, or (ii) the fixed-dose combination of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir for 8 weeks (B1). Treatment-experienced patients with compensated (Child-Pugh A) cirrhosis should be treated without testing genotype/subtype with either: (i) the fixed-dose combination of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir for 12 weeks, or (ii) the fixed-dose combination of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir for 12 weeks (B1). Given the high SVR12 rates expected with these regimens across all groups of patients if adherent, testing for SVR can be omitted (except in patients with high-risk behaviours and risk of reinfection who require SVR testing 12 weeks after the end of treatment and yearly thereafter whenever possible) (B1).</p><p>cirrhosis enables reinforced treatment, while identifying patients infected with HCV genotype 1b allows treatment with the less expensive non-pangenotypic combination of grazoprevir and elbasvir.</p><p>The combination of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir without ribavirin is suboptimal in patients with compensated cirrhosis infected with HCV genotype 3a carrying the Y93H RAS in the NS5A region of the viral genome.

Most cohorts of kidney transplant patients show that HCV positivity is associated with impaired renal graft and patient survival, particularly in patients with cirrhosis. Impaired graft survival partly reflects increased patient mortality. In addition, specific HCV-related causes, such as glomerulonephritis and increased risk of diabetes, will affect graft outcome. HCV positivity is associated with increased all-cause and liver-related mortality, though cardiovascular disease remains the main cause of patient death. <ref type="bibr" target="#b200">202</ref> As cirrhosis is an important predictor of poor postkidney transplant survival after kidney transplantation, it is advisable to assess the stage of liver fibrosis in all HCV-positive kidney transplant candidates. <ref type="bibr" target="#b183">185</ref> For patients with established cirrhosis and portal hypertension who fail (or are unsuitable for) HCV antiviral treatment, combined liver and kidney transplantation must be considered. <ref type="bibr" target="#b201">203</ref> Reports demonstrate that DAA therapies effectively cured HCV in 97% (406/418) of kidney transplant recipients, of whom the majority were treated with sofosbuvir-based regimens. <ref type="bibr" target="#b202">204</ref> In the MAGELLAN-2 study, 100% (20/20) of kidney transplant recipients achieved SVR12 after 12 weeks of the fixed-dose combination of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recommendations</head><p>All patients with post-transplant recurrence of HCV infection must be treated (A1). Treatment should be initiated early after liver transplantation, ideally as early as possible when the patient is stabilised (generally after the first 3 months posttransplant), because the SVR12 rates diminish in patients with advanced post-transplant liver disease (A1). Fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis or the presence of moderate to extensive fibrosis or portal hypertension necessitate urgent antiviral treatment (A1). Patients with post-transplant HCV recurrence without cirrhosis or with compensated (Child-Pugh A) cirrhosis should be treated with either: (i) the fixed-dose combination of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir for 12 weeks (without the need for immunosuppressant drug dose adjustments), or (ii) the fixed-dose combination of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir for 12 weeks (with the need to monitor immunosuppressant drug levels and adjust as needed during and after the end of treatment) (B1). Patients with post-transplant HCV recurrence with decompensated (Child-Pugh B or C) cirrhosis should be treated with the fixed-dose combination of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir with daily weight-based ribavirin (1,000 or 1,200 mg in patients &lt;75 kg or &gt; -75 kg, respectively) for 12 weeks (B1). In patients with post-transplant HCV recurrence with decompensated (Child-Pugh B or C) cirrhosis, ribavirin can be started at the dose of 600 mg daily and the dose subsequently adjusted depending on tolerance (B1). Patients with post-transplant HCV recurrence and decompensated (Child-Pugh B or C) cirrhosis and contraindications for ribavirin, or with poor tolerance to ribavirin on treatment, should be treated with the fixeddose combination of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir for 24 weeks without ribavirin (B1).</p></div>

After transplantation, solid organ transplant recipients, including kidney, heart, lung, pancreas or small bowel recipients, should be treated with the fixed-dose combination of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir for 12 weeks without the need for immunosuppressant drug dose adjustments (B1).

However, it is critical that HCV care in PWIDs be integrated within a framework that addresses drug-related harms, prevents overdose mortality, addresses social inequalities, and improves drug user health. Injecting drug use and risk behaviours appear to remain stable or decrease during and following DAA-based HCV treatment. <ref type="bibr" target="#b299">301</ref> Successful models have been multidisciplinary and often peer-supported in community-based clinics, drug treatment clinics, correctional facilities, needle-syringe programmes, supervised consumption rooms, specialised hospital-based clinics and primary care. <ref type="bibr" target="#b300">302</ref> Reinfection may occur after successful antiviral treatment in active drug users. A recent meta-analysis of 36 studies reported a follow-up of 6,311 person-years. <ref type="bibr" target="#b301">303</ref> The overall rate of HCV reinfection was 5.9/100 person-years among people with recent injecting or non-injecting drug use, 6.2/100 person-years among people recently injecting drugs, and 3.8/100 person-years among those receiving OST. Reinfection rates were comparable following IFN-based and DAA-based therapy (5.4/100 personyears vs. 3.9/100 person-years, respectively). Higher reinfection rates were observed in people with recent drug use receiving or not OST than in people receiving OST with no recent drug use. In meta-regression analysis, longer follow-up was associated with a lower reinfection rate, suggesting higher reinfection risk early post-treatment. <ref type="bibr" target="#b301">303</ref> Thus, patients who injected drugs during the year preceding treatment should be offered ideally bi-annual, at least annual testing for reinfection after DAA-induced SVR.

As a result, HCV is common in correctional facilities. <ref type="bibr" target="#b304">306</ref> In addition, harm reduction is not available to most prisoners. Therefore, the incidence of HCV infection among prisoners who use drugs during incarceration can be very high. Drug use in prisons is increasing.

Pre-therapeutic education should include discussion and counselling about HCV transmission, risk factors for fibrosis progression, treatment, reinfection risk and harm reduction strategies (A1). In patients on OST, DAA-based anti-HCV therapy does not require methadone or buprenorphine dose adjustment (A1). Following SVR, monitoring for HCV reinfection through bi-annual or, at least, annual HCV RNA assessment should be undertaken in PWIDs with an ongoing risk behaviour (A1).

Several cases of remission of B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma have been reported after successful antiviral therapy.

Chronic HCV infection is also frequent in individuals with sickle cell anaemia, with a more rapid course of liver disease because of the concurrent iron overload. <ref type="bibr" target="#b334">336</ref> Haemophilia is an inherited bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency of either factor VIII or IX in haemophilia A and B, respectively. People with haemophilia exposed to non-virally inactivated concentrates prior to 1985 had an almost 100% chance of being infected with HCV with their first exposure to concentrate. There are numerous other inherited bleeding disorders treated with concentrates, including von Willebrand disease and deficiencies of fibrinogen and factors II, VII, X, XI and XIII. Progression to end-stage liver disease in patients with haemophilia is similar to that in HCV-positive individuals in the general population. Transjugular liver biopsies have enhanced the safety of the procedure. Non-invasive methods can be utilised to monitor disease progression. Death from liver failure in HCV-positive individuals was among the commonest causes of death in patients with inherited bleeding disorders.

Coinfection with HIV and HCV is not a contraindication to liver transplantation in haemophilia.

However, there are no data to support these indications, which must be decided on an individual basis by expert multidisciplinary teams, taking into consideration the many parameters at retreatment baseline, including severity of liver disease and/or extrahepatic manifestations, previous unsuccessful courses of treatment, RAS profiles, etc. The presence of decompensated cirrhosis will negate the use of protease inhibitor-based regimens, emphasising the need to institute retreatment as soon as possible. These RASs and other substitutions at the same positions may be present at retreatment baseline in patients who failed to achieve SVR, suggesting reduced susceptibility to drug(s) from the corresponding class(es).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Treatment of recently acquired hepatitis C</head><p>Historically, HCV infection has been classified as either acute or chronic. By convention, acute hepatitis C was defined as the first 6 months of infection, followed by chronic infection in the absence of spontaneous clearance. These definitions are challenged by recent insights into the natural history of HCV persistence, emerging trends in transmission patterns and the evolution of HCV therapy. Acute hepatitis C is generally benign and often asymptomatic. <ref type="bibr" target="#b354">356</ref> In most cases, the diagnosis of HCV infection is based on elevated serum ALT levels, testing of high-risk populations or routine HCV screening. <ref type="bibr" target="#b355">357</ref> Precise timing of infection is therefore difficult to establish. Several funding authorities have denied treatment reimbursement in patients considered to have acute hepatitis C, because the licensing of HCV DAAs was based on studies performed in patients with chronic infection. Given the high efficacy and safety of current HCV DAAs, such classification is a barrier to HCV elimination.</p><p>In this context, the term "recently acquired" hepatitis C is more appropriate than acute hepatitis C. Recently acquired de novo HCV infection is defined by the presence of anti-HCV antibodies, HCV RNA and/or HCV core antigen that were not detectable in previous samples up to 12 months. If such historical samples are unavailable, the diagnosis of recently acquired hepatitis C is based on the presence of HCV RNA or HCV core antigen, in the presence or absence of anti-HCV antibodies, associated with a 3-fold or greater rise in ALT levels above baseline in an individual who had a risk behaviour in the preceding 6 months and in the absence of other causes of acute liver injury. Recently acquired HCV reinfection uses the same criteria following spontaneous or DAA-induced viral clearance. In this case, demonstration of a different strain by means of genome sequence analysis confirms reinfection.</p><p>Recent data indicate that DAA treatment in the early phase of HCV infection is cost-effective and useful to achieve microelimination in specific groups of patients, <ref type="bibr" target="#b356">358</ref> whereas postponing therapy to meet the criteria for chronic infection increases the risk of HCV transmission. In HIV-infected patients, the lack of a 2-log drop of HCV RNA level 4 weeks after the initial presentation predicts a low-likelihood (negative predictive value &lt;1%) of spontaneous clearance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b357">359</ref> Thus, at least in individuals living with HIV, early chronic HCV infection can be defined as an estimated duration of infection &lt;12 months and a lack of a 2-log reduction of HCV RNA levels 4 weeks after initial presentation with recently acquired hepatitis C.</p><p>High SVR rates have been reported in a small number of patients with recently acquired hepatitis C receiving DAA-based regimens. The ideal duration of treatment remains unknown. Three trials were performed with the fixed-dose combination of sofosbuvir and ledipasvir in patients infected with genotype 1.

In all cases, HCV RNA or HCV core antigen assessment at week 12 or 24 indicates whether treatment has been successful.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Monitoring of treatment safety</head><p>New DAA regimens are generally well tolerated. Frequencies of high-grade or severe adverse events leading to discontinuation are low. However, data in patients with decompensated cirrhosis or in liver transplant recipients are scarce.</p><p>The proportion of patients who permanently discontinued treatment because of adverse events during treatment was &lt;1% for patients receiving sofosbuvir and velpatasvir for 12 weeks. In clinical studies, no difference with placebo-containing arms was observed. Fatigue and headache were the most common adverse events in these patients. The addition of voxilaprevir was associated with more frequent benign diarrhoea (18% and 15% in patients receiving the triple combination and 7% and 5% in those receiving sofosbuvir and velpatasvir only in the POLARIS-2 and POLARIS-3 trials, respectively). <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36</ref> The proportion of patients who permanently discontinued treatment because of adverse events was &lt;0.5% for patients receiving glecaprevir and pibrentasvir for 8 or 12 weeks. <ref type="bibr" target="#b365">367</ref> In an integrated analysis of 2,265 patients treated with this combination in phase II and III clinical trials, fatigue and headache were the most common adverse events. <ref type="bibr" target="#b365">367</ref> Severe adverse events were observed in 2.4% of patients receiving grazoprevir and elbasvir. They led to treatment interruptions in 0.1% of cases. The most frequent adverse events were fatigue, headache, and nausea, not more frequent than in placebo-containing arms. During the phase II and III trials, 0.8% (13/1,690) of patients experienced asymptomatic ALT elevations up to &gt;5 times the upper limit of normal, on average 10 weeks after the start of treatment. These events resolved spontaneously with continued therapy or end of treatment. Three patients (0.18%) discontinued because of ALT elevation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Monitoring of drug-drug interactions</head><p>The efficacy and toxicity of concurrent drugs given for comorbidities and potential drug-drug interactions should be monitored during treatment. It is important to review all the drugs taken by the patient, including over-the-counter preparations and recreational drugs. It is necessary to check whether all the co-administered drugs are necessary during the period of HCV treatment. It may be possible to stop a drug, such as a statin, for a period of 8-12 weeks. If not, an alternative in the same therapeutic class without a drug interaction should be found. A drug interaction can also be managed either by a change of dose or a clear monitoring plan. The introduction of new medications during HCV treatment requires monitoring.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recommendations</head><p>Patients with recently acquired de novo hepatitis C should be treated with the combination of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir or with the combination of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir for 8 weeks (B1). SVR should be assessed 12 and 24 weeks after treatment, because late relapses have been reported (B2). There is no indication for antiviral therapy as postexposure prophylaxis in the absence of documented HCV transmission (B1).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recommendations</head><p>HCV RNA or HCV core antigen detection should be performed at week 12 (SVR12) or 24 (SVR24) post-treatment to assess whether treatment has been successful (A1). Given the high SVR12 rates expected with pangenotypic DAA-based regimens, checking SVR is dispensable, except in patients with high-risk behaviours and in patients at risk of reinfection (B1).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recommendations</head><p>The patients receiving a DAA-containing regimen should be assessed for clinical side effects at each visit (A1). ALT levels should be assessed at least at baseline and at 12-(or 24-) weeks post-treatment, and in case of suggestive symptoms (B1). Renal function should be checked monthly in patients with reduced eGFR (A1).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recommendations</head><p>The efficacy and toxicity of concurrent drugs given for comorbidities and potential drug-drug interactions should be monitored during treatment (A1). When possible, an interacting co-medication should be stopped for the duration of HCV treatment, or the interacting co-medication should be switched to an alternative drug with less interaction potential (B1).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Treatment dose reductions</head><p>No dose adjustments are required or recommended for any of the above-recommended DAA combination regimens. Treatment must be stopped in case of severe adverse events or in case of a hepatitis flare (ALT levels above 10 times the upper limit of normal, if not already present at the time of starting treatment).</p><p>If significant anaemia occurs (haemoglobin &lt;10 g/dl) in patients with decompensated (Child-Pugh B or C) cirrhosis receiving ribavirin, the dose of ribavirin should be adjusted downward by 200 mg in decrements. A more rapid reduction of dose may be required for patients with rapidly declining haemoglobin, particularly if their baseline haemoglobin was low. Ribavirin administration should be stopped if the haemoglobin level falls below 8.5 g/dl. <ref type="bibr" target="#b366">[368]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b367">[369]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b368">[370]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b369">[371]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b370">[372]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b371">[373]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b372">[374]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b373">[375]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b374">[376]</ref> Post-treatment follow-up of patients who achieve an SVR</p><p>In patients without cirrhosis who achieve an SVR, the HCV infection can be considered as definitively cured.

In patients without varices at baseline, annual monitoring of platelet counts and transient elastography assessment allows for individualised monitoring with endoscopy.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recommendations</head><p>Patients with no to moderate fibrosis (METAVIR score F0-F2) with SVR and no ongoing risk behaviour should be discharged, provided that they have no other comorbidities (A1). Patients with advanced fibrosis (F3) or cirrhosis (F4) with SVR should undergo surveillance for HCC every 6 months by means of ultrasound, because the risk of de novo or incident HCC is reduced but not abolished by SVR (A1). In patients with cirrhosis, surveillance for oesophageal varices by endoscopy should be performed if varices were present at pre-treatment endoscopy, or if the platelet count falls below 150,000 and elastography increases to more than 20 kPa (A1). The risk of reinfection should be explained to positively modify risk behaviour in at-risk populations (B1). Following SVR, monitoring for HCV reinfection through bi-annual or, at least, annual HCV RNA assessments should be undertaken in PWIDs or men who have sex with men with ongoing risk behaviour (A1). Retreatment should be offered without stigma or delay to those patients who are reinfected (A1).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recommendations</head><p>Untreated patients with chronic hepatitis C and those who definitively failed several prior treatment courses (incurable patients) should be regularly followed (A1).

Patients with decompensated (Child-Pugh B or C) cirrhosis with an indication for treatment should be treated with the fixed-dose combination of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir plus daily weight-based ribavirin (1,000 or 1,200 mg in patients &lt;75 kg or &gt; -75 kg, respectively) for 12 weeks. Ribavirin can be started at the dose of 600 mg daily and the dose subsequently adjusted depending on tolerance (A1). Patients with decompensated (Child-Pugh B or C) cirrhosis with an indication for treatment with contraindications for ribavirin, or with poor tolerance to ribavirin on treatment, should be treated with the fixed-dose combination of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir for 24 weeks without ribavirin (B1). Patients with decompensated (Child-Pugh B or C) cirrhosis without HCC awaiting liver transplantation with a MELD score &gt; -18-20 should be transplanted first, without antiviral treatment, and HCV infection should be treated after liver transplantation (B1). If the waiting time on the transplant list exceeds 6 months, patients with decompensated (Child-Pugh B or C) cirrhosis without HCC awaiting liver transplantation with a MELD score &gt; -18-20 should be treated before transplantation, depending on the local circumstances (B1).</figDesc></figure>
