<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease increases with advancing age. Elevated LDL-cholesterol and non-HDLcholesterol levels remain predictive of incident atherosclerotic cardiovascular events among individuals older than 75 years. Risk prediction among older individuals is less certain because most current risk calculators lack specificity in those older than 75 years and do not adjust for co-morbidities, functional status, frailty, and cognition which significantly impact prognosis in this age group. Data on the benefits and risks of lowering LDL-cholesterol with statins in older patients without atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease are also limited since most primary prevention trials have included mostly younger patients. Available data suggest that statin therapy in older primary prevention patients may reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular events and that benefits from lipid-lowering with statins outweigh potential risks such as statin-associated muscle symptoms and incident Type 2 diabetes mellitus. While some evidence suggests the possibility that statins may be associated with incident cognitive impairment in older adults, a preponderance of literature indicates neutral or even protective statin-related cognitive effects. Shared decisionmaking which is recommended for all patients when considering statin therapy is particularly important in older patients. Randomized clinical trial data evaluating the use of non-statin lipid-lowering therapy in older patients are sparse. Deprescribing</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preamble</head><p>Since 2014, the National Lipid Association (NLA) has issued several scientific statements on key aspects of the management of lipids and lipoproteins to prevent cardiovascular disease (<ref type="url" target="https://www">https:// www</ref>. lipid. org/ pract iceto ols/ docum ents). The current Expert Clinical Consensus, focused on the treatment of hypercholesterolemia among individuals older than 75 years without clinically manifest atherosclerotic cardio vascular disease (ASCVD), was developed as a collaboration between the NLA and the American Geriatrics Society (AGS). The governing bodies of both organizations appointed members with relevant expertise to the writing group which was jointly chaired by a representative of NLA (V. B.) and AGS (S.A.L.). The Expert Clinical Consensus was developed by a diverse group of clinical lipidologists, cardiologists, geriatricians, and pharmacists with cumulative expertise in clinical medicine, geriatrics, cardiology, endocrinology, pharmacology, clinical trials, epidemiology, health outcomes research, and public health.</p><p>The chairs and members of the writing group jointly developed a set of key clinical questions to be addressed by the panel. Once the key clinical questions were agreed upon, writing assignments were jointly determined by the group based on content expertise with a primary and secondary author assigned to each question. The literature was reviewed and recommendations were developed using the 2019 Update of the American Heart Association (AHA) / American College of Cardiology (ACC) rating system for clinical guidelines, assigning a Class of Recommendation (I-III) and a Level of Evidence (A-C with sub categories) for each recommendation (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">2</ref> Each section and its associated recommendations were discussed in detail by the writing group. Preliminary recommendations were presented at the Annual Scientific Meeting of AGS (AGS23) in May 2023 and feedback from the audience was incorporated as appropriate. Final recommendations based on consensus of at least 60% of the expert panel were then reviewed by external peer reviewers, edited as appropriate and approved by the respective Boards of the NLA and AGS on 9/20/2024.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Synopsis</head><p>Cross-sectional and prospective cohort studies show that atherogenic lipoproteins increase with age from early adulthood to the 7th decade, but gradually decrease in subsequent decades. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">4</ref> This decrease among the oldest old (8th decade and beyond) is likely multifactorial including survivor bias (i.e., selective mortality at younger ages among those with the highest atherogenic lipoprotein levels) and declines in cholesterol associated with co-morbidities (e.g., heart failure, malignancies, malnutrition). Many studies have shown strong and graded associations between LDL-C level and incident ASCVD in women and men and across ethnicities among young and middle-aged populations. In contrast, early epidemiologic analyses among older individuals suggested an inverse association between total cholesterol and outcomes which is most consistent with reverse causation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">5</ref> More contemporary analyses suggest that the association of LDL-C level to incident ASCVD is maintained in the oldest age groups. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">6</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recommendation-specific supportive text</head><p>In 2007, a meta-analysis of 61 prospective studies analyzed ischemic heart disease mortality as a function of total cholesterol or non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) stratified by sex and age (5th to 9th decade). <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">7</ref> Relative risk of ischemic heart disease mortality related to the level of total cholesterol or non-HDL-C was highest among 40-49 year-olds. Relative risk decreased in a graded fashion with each advancing decade, but it remained statistically significant to age 80-89 years. In contrast, absolute risk was lowest in the youngest age group and increased with advancing age.</p><p>The prospective Copenhagen General Study investigated the association of LDL-C with incident myocardial infarction (MI) and ASCVD in 91,131 participants ranging in age from 20-100 years old; 10,591 participants were 70-79 years old and 3,188 participants were 80-100 years old. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">6</ref> Higher LDL-C was predictive of incident MI and ASCVD independent of age. As in the Prospective Studies Collaboration, relative risks of MI and ASCVD (expressed as adjusted hazard ratios (HRadj)) were highest in the youngest (20-49 year-old) age group (MI HRadj 1.68 (95% CI 1.45-1.87); ASCVD HRadj 1.47 (95% CI 1.32-1.64)) and lowest in the oldest (80-100 year-old) age group (MI HRadj 1.28 (95% CI 1.08-1.52); ASCVD HRadj 1.16 (95% CI 1.05-1.29)). By contrast, absolute risk of events was lowest in the youngest age group and highest in the oldest age group. Based on these prospective observational data, the authors estimated the number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent MI or ASCVD for every 1 mmol/L (38.67 mg/dL) lowering of LDL-C over 5 years. The estimated NNT declined with each decade of age (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). For ASCVD, the estimated NNT for 80-100 yearold participants was 42 compared to 345 for 50-59 year-old participants; for MI, the respective estimated NNTs were 80 and 439. Thus, LDL-C is an important risk factor among patients older than 75 years and should be measured for ASCVD risk stratification. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Synopsis</head><p>Calibrating the use and intensity of preventive therapies to an individual's absolute ASCVD risk is the foundation of risk assessment. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">9</ref> Generally, this includes (a) the use of risk stratification tools to estimate 10-year risk of an ASCVD event, (b) personalizing this risk estimate, and (c) then further refining this risk using imaging in select patients. For older adults, several risk stratification tools are available (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">1</ref>). Since chronologic age is one of the most heavily weighted risk factors in all the currently available risk stratification tools, these tools are limited by a lack of specificity in identifying older adults most likely to benefit from preventive therapies including statin therapy. Most risk stratification tools do not incorporate other considerations that are very important in older adults including co-morbidities, life expectancy, functional status, frailty, and cognition and most do not take into account the competing risk of non-cardiovascular mortality <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">10</ref> , which may lead to the over-estimation of ASCVD risk and of the potential benefit from risk factor reduction. Use of models that adjust for competing risk in older adults can help estimate individualized treatment effects and inform clinical decision making. Assessment of vascular age using markers of subclinical atherosclerosis (e.g., CAC scoring [Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">2</ref>]) can assist clinicians in refining risk assessment and identifying older adults most likely to benefit from preventive therapies including statin therapy. Lifestyle therapy including a heart healthy diet and physical activity remains first line therapy in older adults, regardless of the results of risk assessment, given the independent association with all-cause mortality and favorable impact on physical functioning and mental wellbeing.      The pooled cohort risk equations (PCE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">11</ref> , which are sex and race-specific were derived from five community-based cohorts of Black and White participants in the U.S. aged 40-79 years and are generally considered most applicable to the U.S. population. Like other risk stratification algorithms, the PCE are also heavily influenced by age, yielding risk estimates among older individuals with favorable risk profiles that are well above the traditional 10-year ASCVD risk thresholds used to perform risk discussion regarding statin treatment. Despite these limitations, the use of the PCE could be helpful in individual patients. First, clinicians could use the 10-year risk estimation as a medium to communicate risk in a numeric form to the patient and to discuss healthy lifestyle choices with the patient. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">15</ref> Second, a higher risk may identify which risk factor(s) might be driving the higher ASCVD risk in an older adult and allow clinicians and patients to focus prevention efforts on those specific risk factors (e.g., uncontrolled hypertension, smoking).  Clinicians could discuss how the patient's 10-year ASCVD risk would be reduced if all risk factors were optimal. This could motivate patients to improve their adherence to lifestyle therapy and preventive medications. Recently, the AHA published risk equations (Predicting Risk of CVD EVENTs [PREVENT]) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">16</ref> which assess the risk of cardiovascular events (ASCVD and heart failure). These equations included adults between the ages of 30-79 years of age and adjusted for competing risk of non-cardiovascular deaths.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recommendation-specific supportive text</head><p>In addition to traditional risk factors included in PCEs, PREVENT also includes statin use and estimated glomerular filtration rate as predictors in the model. PREVENT equations also allow the use of optional predictors such as urine albumin to creatinine ratio, hemoglobin A1C, and social deprivation index. Although PREVENT includes heart failure as an outcome in addition to ASCVD, which is of importance especially for older adults, it remains to be seen if PREVENT performs better than PCE or other risk equations in individuals older than 75 years. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">16</ref> 2. There are 4 competing-risk adjusted models for ASCVD risk estimation in older adults (SCORE2-OP, NORRISK2, PROSPER, and the CHS-Rotterdam model). <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[20]</ref> Use of these models can help estimate individualized treatment effects and inform clinical decision making, though it should be noted that they are not yet standard of care. An interactive tool that uses one of these models, SCORE2-OP, is available online (<ref type="url" target="https://www">https:// www</ref>. heart score. org/ en_ GB). Limitations of the models are that they may have limited generalizability outside the Northern European populations in which they were developed, and results of NORRISK2 and PROSPER cannot be extrapolated to the very old (≥85 years). Lastly, some important determinants for ASCVD risk in older adults were not included in all the models, such as kidney function or other markers of frailty.</p><p>3. Several epidemiologic studies have shown that adults aged 75 years and older with CAC = 0 have low ASCVD event rates and mortality (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">2</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[25]</ref> In the 10-year follow-up from the MESA study <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">21</ref> , the 10-year ASCVD rate was 5.6% among those aged 75 years or older with CAC = 0. In the CAC consortium <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">22</ref>  • The model was fitted for the prediction of 3.2-year risk (median follow-up), and these estimates were extrapolated to derive 5-year and 10-year CVD event risks. • By entering patient characteristics in the model formula, it is possible to estimate the CVD risk and absolute risk reduction (ARR) with and without statin treatment for an individual patient; however, an interactive clinical tool has not been developed. The ARR can be translated into an individual number needed to treat-the number of patients with the same risk profile who would need to be treated to prevent 1 event in 5 or 10 years. • Limitations of this model are that it was derived and validated only in Northern European populations, and results cannot be extrapolated to the very old (≥85 years) and to patients with stage IV or V chronic kidney disease (eGFR &lt;30 mL/min), since they were not enrolled in these studies.</p><p>• Formula for estimating risk and absolute risk reduction with and without statin treatment for an individual patient is available here: <ref type="url" target="https://doi">https:// doi</ref>. org/ 10. 1007/ s0039 • The prediction model had moderate ability to discriminate between events and nonevents (c-statistic, 0.63 in both U.S. and European men and 0.67 and 0.68 in U.S. and European women). • The model was well-calibrated (good agreement between predicted and observed risks). • Note that the number of non-coronary deaths exceeded the number of CHD events over the entire age range and this gap was more pronounced at older ages. • May be less applicable to non-white populations.</p><p>• There is no clinician-accesible web version for this model.   • CAC 0, 1-99, and ≥ 100 were seen in 32%, 29%, and 39%, respectively. • Carotid imaging was performed to detect and quantify carotid plaque burden (cPB). The top CAC group comprised those with CAC ≥100, and the top cPB group comprised those with cPB ≥300 mm2 (chosen to match the percentile for CAC ≥100, giving 2 top groups of similar size but selected differently).</p><p>• cPB was zero in 23%. • 86% of participants were statin eligible (10-year ASCVD risk ≥ 7.5%). HR for CVD events were 1.48 (0.75-2.92) and 3.98 ((2.20-7.18) for CAC 1-99, and CAC ≥100 respectively compared to CAC 0 (referent). • For cPB, the HR for CVD events were 1.23 (0.67-2.26) and 2.14 (1.20-3.78) for cPB 1-299, and ≥ 300 mm 2 compared with no cPB.</p><p>• For cardiovascular disease events (including revascularization), the NRI was 0.14 for CAC and 0.06 for CPB. The positive NRIs were driven primarily by down classifying the large subpopulation with CAC 0 or cPB 0.</p></div>

Using a cut-off score of 100, approximately 50% of in-dividuals older than 75 years will be identified as "high-risk" providing an opportunity for a risk-based discussion regarding statin therapy in such individuals. Prevalence of CAC≥100 varies based on sex and ethnicity with lower prevalence in women, Chinese, Black and Hispanic individuals compared with men, Whites, and South Asian individuals. Although absolute CAC scores generally predict ASCVD outcomes over a much shorter time-horizon compared with percentiles which generally predict long-term or lifetime ASCVD outcomes, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">28</ref> it is reasonable to use age-, sex-, race-based percentile cut-offs in this age segment given high absolute CAC prevalence.

The decision should incorporate patient values and preferences as well as consideration of significant competing health risks, cognitive and functional status, and life expectancy.</p></div>

Although age was not specifically studied, 83% of the population was aged 60 years and older (mean age 65.5±8.6 years). The trial demonstrated that 90% of SAMS were attributable to a nocebo effect, triggered by taking a pill itself, not by the statin in the pill, plausibly because the individual believes that the pill will cause harm. While 26 of 60 participants taking the statin had to stop the medication early due to intolerable side-effects, so did 23 of 60 taking placebo. However, 6 months after completion of the protocol (i.e., after participants understood their results), 30 of 60 (50%) participants successfully restarted statins, including 10 who had stopped statins during the trial because of side effects.

New onset T2DM: A post hoc analysis of the JUPITER <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">52</ref> trial first demonstrated an increase in new onset T2DM among participants with at least one diabetes-risk factor randomized to rosuvastatin (HR 1.28, 95% CI 1.07-1.54), but no risk increase among those without risk factors for T2DM. Risks of T2DM were counterbalanced by a 39% reduction in the primary combined endpoint of myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina, arterial revascularization, or cardiovascular death (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.47-0.79) and a nonsignificant 17% reduction in total mortality (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.64-1.07). In participants with at least one major diabetes risk factor, 134 vascular events or deaths were avoided for every 54 cases of newly diagnosed T2DM. This increase in new onset T2DM risk was subsequently confirmed in three meta-analyses. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">51,</ref><ref type="bibr">53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">61</ref> Pooled data from 13 statin trials showed a 9% increase in new onset T2DM, translating to approximately 1 new case of T2DM for every 255 individuals treated with a statin for 4 years. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">51</ref> The most recent analysis from the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' Collaboration confirmed the increase in risk of T2DM with low/moderate intensity and with high intensity statin use, but there was no heterogeneity of this risk by age. <ref type="bibr">53</ref> In the PROSPER trial of 70-82 year-old participants, 6.6% of those randomized to pravastatin developed T2DM compared to 5.1% of those allocated to placebo. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">38</ref> A propensity-matched analysis of Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug claims found a 4.82% cumulative incidence of T2DM over 7 years with an adjusted OR of 1.26 (95% CI 1.12-1.41) among statin users. <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">62</ref> Mean age in those with new onset T2DM was 72.1 ± 5.1 years.

There was a trend toward an increase in Alzheimer's Disease (HR 1.33; 95% CI: 1.00 to 1.77; p = 0.05).

There is substantial variability in life expectancy among older adults of the same age, e.g., a healthy 85-year-old woman is expected to live an additional 10 years (and would be likely to benefit from primary prevention) while a frail, multimorbid 85-year-old woman may have less than 2 years remaining life expectancy and may not stand to benefit. <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">71</ref> Clinicians can consider morbidity burden, functional status and frailty to estimate life expectancy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">71</ref> If an individual's life expectancy is greater than the time to benefit for a given preventive intervention, the intervention may help and should generally be recommended. <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">72</ref> If the life expectancy is shorter than the time to benefit, the intervention is more likely to harm and generally should not be recommended.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Synopsis</head><p>Deprescribing medications is an important part of the prescribing continuum and an essential component of high-quality care for older adults with multiple comorbidities, geriatric syndromes and polypharmacy who are more susceptible to medicationrelated harms. Benefits of deprescribing statins (e.g., taking fewer medications, avoiding interactions with other medications such as antibiotics or antifungal agents that are metabolized through the same pathway as the statin, avoiding adverse effects in general) must be balanced against the potential for harm, such as an increase in ASCVD events after statin discontinuation. General principles of deprescribing include viewing deprescribing as a routine part of care designed to improve patient well-being (rather than withdrawal of appropriate care) and shared decision-making with the patient/caregiver. <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">99</ref> Three large cohort studies provide evidence for clinicians and patients regarding the risks and benefits of statin discontinuation on cardiovascular events in older adults without a history of cardiovascular disease who are taking statins (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_20">6</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">[100]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">[101]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">[102]</ref> One small prospective trial found benefits of deprescribing among older adults near the end of life. 103</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recommendation-specific supportive text</head><p>1. Clinical decision making and communication for deprescribing statins can be complex regardless of the patient's medical conditions and frailty. It is prudent for clinicians to have thoughtful conversations with their patients and their caregivers regarding the potential benefits and risks of statin continuation and deprescribing in older age. Some clinicians may need to acknowledge and overcome their own uncertainty about stopping statins if their patients are interested in discontinuation. A study of 180 acutely ill Australian older adults found that 95% were willing to stop their statin, predominantly over concerns for adverse effects. <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">104</ref> When discussing statin discontinuation through shared decision-making, clinicians may also need to alter their communication about deprescribing based on their patient's preferences. A survey of 90 Danish general practitioners identified that the most important topic clinicians wanted to discuss related to stopping statins was goals of therapy, while adverse effects were considered less important. <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">105</ref> However, a U.S. study of 835 older adults found that most patients preferred phrasing focused on the risk of adverse effects when discussing deprescribing a statin. <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">106</ref> Although existing data suggest the risk of statin-related adverse effects is low, older adults with frailty, severe functional or cognitive impairment, or polypharmacy have not been well-represented in studies that assessed adverse effects. Adverse effects, even mild ones, may play a greater role in driving decisions about statin therapy for such patients, and observational data suggest that nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue and dizziness are associated with the total number of medications as well as with individual medications. <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">107</ref> Another small qualitative study of clinicians, caregivers and older adults with dementia found that patients and caregivers preferred clinicians to explain that aging and comorbid conditions may shift the balance of benefits and risks of medications such as statins. Examples of such phrasing are "Our bodies change over time and certain medicines may no longer be needed" and "These medications take years to have an effect and I think that we should focus on what can help you right now". <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">108</ref> 2. Three observational cohort studies of older adults taking statins for primary prevention in France, Denmark and Italy (aggregate N &gt; 200,000 individuals) reported an increased risk of cardiovascular events over a subsequent 2-5 year period among patients who stopped their statin, compared to patients who continued (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_20">6</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">[100]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">[101]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">[102]</ref> Adjusted HRs suggested an approximately 30% increase in admissions for ASCVD events during follow-up among those who discontinued statins. The reasons for statin discontinuation were unknown. While investigators adjusted for baseline characteristics or performed propensitymatching prior to data analysis, results may in part reflect residual unmeasured or unknown confounding. It is also unknown whether these estimates translate to the U.S. population. Nevertheless, these studies provide risk estimates for statin discontinuation that can be incorporated into shared decision-making conversations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3.</head><p>Deprescribing may provide benefits for patients near the end of their life. Kutner et al. evaluated 60-day survival after statin deprescribing in an unblinded randomized, parallel group non-inferiority trial of 381 individuals with life-limiting illness and an estimated survival of &lt; 1 year; 36% of patients were enrolled in hospice. There were no differences in 60-day survival or cardiovascular events between the 2 groups. Quality of life was improved and medication cost (using 2012 retail pricing) lowered among those who discontinued their statin. <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">103</ref> These results indicate that it may be reasonable to discontinue statin therapy in patients with limited life expectancy due to co-morbid conditions. Further research would be helpful to guide deprescribing discussions in this population.</p></div>

The SITE study <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">117</ref> enrolled 1230 French participants aged 75 years and older who were taking statins for primary prevention of ASCVD. Patients were randomized to continue or discontinue their statin, with a follow-up of 3 years. The study was completed in January 2023 and will report on outcomes of incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year gained, overall mortality, quality of life, cardiovascular events, T2DM, and cognitive disorders. The STREAM study (<ref type="url" target="https://clini">https:// clini</ref> caltr ials. gov/ study/ NCT05 178420) in Switzerland is actively enrolling 1800 participants and is expected to be complete in November 2026. The study is a noninferiority clinical trial of adults aged 70 years and older who are taking a statin for primary prevention of ASCVD and are randomized to either continue or discontinue their statin with a follow-up of a mean of 24 months. The major outcomes of the study will be all-cause death and major non-fatal cardiovascular events.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>The STAREE and PREVENTABLE trials will shed light on the benefits of statin initiation in adults over age 70 years. The SITE and STREAM studies will be the first large prospective trials to inform the benefits and risks of discontinuing statins later in life. Future trials should include more diverse study articipants to better represent the diverse patient populations treated with statins in the US and globally. In addition, better risk stratification methods in older individuals using improved risk equations derived from diverse cohorts, new imaging modalities or new biomarkers may further enhance ASCVD prediction allowing better targeting of those at greatest risk. While we await further evidence, in those who do not have a life limiting illness, primary prevention therapy with a statin can be considered as part of shared decision-making.</p></div>

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration removed the recommendation for routine liver function test measurements with statin therapy in 2012. The 2018 AHA/ACC/Multisociety cholesterol guidelines recommend measurement of liver function tests at baseline and if there are signs or symptoms of hepatotoxicity during therapy. The guidelines further recommend a comprehensive evaluation of musculoskeletal symptoms prior to statin treatment because such symptoms are common in the general adult population and especially in older individuals.

The mean baseline LDL-C level was approximately 162 mg/dL. Due to loss of follow-up, withdrawn consent, and trial irregularities, only 1716 ezetimibe patients and 1695 usual care patients were analyzed. The level of LDL-C at 1 year was 144.1 mg/dL among usual care and 126.1 mg/dL in the ezetimibe group, translating to an incremental LDL-C reduction of approximately 18 mg/dL in the ezetimibe group.
