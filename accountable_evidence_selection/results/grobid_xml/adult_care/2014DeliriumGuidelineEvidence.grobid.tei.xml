<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HELP Intervention</head><p>Goals:</p><p>(1) to maintain physical and cognitive functioning throughout hospitalization;</p><p>(2) to maximize independence at discharge;</p><p>(3) to assist with the transition from hospital to home; and (4) to prevent unplanned readmission. Despite some baseline differences between the intervention and control groups, there was still a strong association between number of days with postoperative delirium and being treated in the control group.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Core interventions</head><p>The effect of the intervention program seemed to reduce the incidence of delirium on the first postoperative day.</p><p>This may be explained by the fact that, when the patients arrived at the intervention ward, they were immediately and systematically assessed to detect, treat and prevent any complications that would cause delirium.</p><p>Patients with dementia seemed to have benefited from the intervention program. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion:</head><p>This study shows that postoperative delirium can be successfully treated by a team applying comprehensive geriatric assessment, management and rehabilitation. The intervention program resulted in fewer days with delirium, fewer other complications, and shorter hospital stays. Implementing this intervention program will probably have a great humanitarian and economic impact, and is probably applicable to surgery on old people in general. Therefore, the organization of surgical wards should be reconsidered and adapted to the needs of the oldest and frailest patients. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion:</head><p>The findings of this study indicate that simple interventions targeting dementia, vision loss, hearing loss, and mobility limitations can prevent delirium in some patients when these risk factors are identified and targeted by nurses. Although the protocol prevented some cases of delirium, nursing protocols will not prevent delirium in all elderly patients. A significant reduction in delirium, from 37.5% before protocol implementation to 13.8% after implementation, occurred in the elders receiving the protocol. There was no significant difference in functional status between the intervention and control cohorts or for either the delirious or nondelirious patients.</p><p>However delirious patients in both cohorts were more dependent after discharge and 3 months after discharge.</p><p>Neither cohort of the delirious patients regained their prefracture functional status.</p><p>Delirious patients in both cohorts also had a slower functional rehabilitation over time.</p><p>There was no significant difference in length of stay between intervention and control groups or between delirious and nondelirious patients </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comments:</head><p>The author performed daily interviews in a large population of patients undergoing noncardiac surgery to measure their level of pain and development of delirium.</p><p>The author found an association between higher pain levels at rest and the development of delirium.</p><p>The results suggest that better control of postoperative pain may reduce this serious complication.</p><p>Increased pain at rest was the only type of pain associated with an increased risk of developing delirium.</p><p>Although pain with movement or maximal pain may represent more of an acute physiologic stress, patients experience pain at rest for more hours of the day.</p><p>Therefore, pain at rest is more likely to affect their sleep-wake cycle and hormonal milieu.</p><p>In this study, there was a higher percentage of missing pain scores among delirious patients (29% vs 1.4%); therefore, it seems that delirium accounts for most of the missing scores.</p><p>* The risk factors for which we controlled are: age, preoperative cognitive status, Specific Activity Scale class, abnormal electrolytes, and alcohol abuse.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion:</head><p>Increased postoperative pain at rest was associated with postoperative delirium. Unlike unmodifiable risk factors for delirium, the quality of postoperative analgesia can be improved and therefore the incidence of postoperative delirium decreased. Two patients (one in each group) had postoperative sedation reported.</p><p>No patient had dizziness, nystagmus, or ataxia.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comments:</head><p>In surgical pain models and in clinical studies of inflammatory pain that produce allodynia and hyperalgesia, gabapentin and its analogs improve pain.</p><p>These findings suggest that sensitization of dorsal horn neurons may be an important mechanism for pain in the early postoperative period.</p><p>In </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comments:</head><p>This study reports no cases of PD in an elderly patient population after fast-track elective THA and TKA during hospitalization and 1-2 weeks follow-up.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comments:</head><p>The delirium symptoms reported in this study likely capture more subtle and partial forms of delirium that do not meet full delirium criteria.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion:</head><p>Nurses play an important role in the prediction, assessment and prevention of post-operative delirium.

Sedatives should be administered with caution because they increase a patient's risk of developing delirium.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comments:</head><p>In this study, 56% of the patients complained of nausea and 42% suffered from postoperative vomiting even in placebo group. Therefore, transdermal application of rivastigmine could have been an advantage. However, at the time of the study transdermal rivastigmine was not available.  Comments: Although all randomized patients were included in the analysis, only 58 patients actually completed the study. Adherence to study medication was poor. More than 25% of both groups took less than the 28 days of the assigned drug. There were no significant differences between groups for the study completers. Even when symptoms of delirium appeared, they were relatively mild and brief.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion:</head><p>This study does not answer the question as to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors might be useful in other populations with delirium or at higher risk of developing it.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comments:</head><p>The current study showed that 57.1% of patients experienced SSD after surgery. The incidence of clinical delirium observed in the current study was 23.8%.</p><p>Neither the ICDSC nor the CAM-ICU has been validated for severity scoring of delirium, so the highest score on the ICDSC was reported in the current study as a measure of severity, taking advantage of the ordinal framework of this scale.</p><p>it is probable that the study had low power to detect a statistically significant difference between the two groups with regard to ICU, hospital length of stay, duration of delirium, highest score on the ICDSC, or consumption of antipsychotic medications. n = 50 placebo q12h po.</p><p>Men/women = 36/14 Age: 65 to 70 yr 39 (78%) &gt;70 yr 11 (22%)</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Intervention (see above)</formula><p>Patients in the placebo group who experienced delirium were given 0.5 mg oral risperidone every 12 h, and if symptoms were not controlled, the dose could be increased to 4 mg/d.</p><p>In either group, haloperidol was used as a second line rescue medication if symptoms were not controlled with risperidone in a daily dose of 4 mg.</p><p>Haloperidol was begun orally at 0.5 mg q8h and could be escalated to 10 mg/d if needed. Rescue medications were started once the diagnosis of delirium was confirmed, and the dosage could be escalated by doubling the dose at 24-h intervals, if needed, until symptoms were controlled or the maximum dosage limit was attained.</p><p>Rescue medications were continued for 24h after a score of 0 was achieved on the ICDSC. Conclusion: Using risperidone in elderly patients who experienced subsyndromal delirium after onpump cardiac surgery was associated with significantly lower incidence of delirium.   One patient was withdrawn from quetiapine due to complaints of sedation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comments</head><p>The trial was stopped early at the request of the manufacturer due to FDA concerns on the use of antipsychotic medication in the elderly.</p><p>A statistically significant improvement in noncognitive items including restlessness, agitation, thought disorder, and perceptual impairment on the DRS-R-98 was found on Day 3 with a mean dose of quetiapine lower than previously documented, possibly contributed to by the high mean age of 84 years.</p><p>Due to the small sample size, this should be considered a pilot study. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>See above</head><p>Conclusion: Quetiapine has the potential to more quickly reduce the severity of noncognitive aspects of delirium. This study was underpowered for treatment comparisons at specific points in time but nonetheless detected significant differences when analyzing the whole study period. While it is not possible to draw definitive conclusions, further larger studies exploring the use of quetiapine in other delirium populations seem justified. Larger increments in the dose of quetiapine may yield even stronger results. Comments: The author thought differences might exist between Asian and non-Asian populations in the pharmacokinetics of psychotropic agents. Thus, the effective doses might be lower than those given to Caucasian patients.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion:</head><p>There were no significant differences in efficacy or response rate between haloperidol and risperidone among patients with delirium. Although a larger study might find significant differences it can be cautiously suggested that risperidone is not superior to haloperidol for the acute treatment of delirium. -Only Group V showed a longer ICU stay compared to -Group I (p=0.002), -Group II (p=0.005) -Group III (p=0.015). -Group V also showed a longer intubation time compared to -Group I (p=0.008) -Group II (p=0.002). -Length of ICU stay -Group I vs V (p=0.013) -Group II vs V (p=0.023) -Intubation time -Group II vs V (p=0.01). -Incidence of neurological events -higher in Group V (p&lt;0.001) -Incidence of delirium -Group IV (p&lt;0.001) Aortic dissections vs elective surgery Aortic dissection -All deaths (n=19, p&lt;0.001).</p><p>-Higher incidence of post-op neurological events (p=0.01) -Higher incidence of delirium (p=0.007) -Higher incidence of delirium requiring therapy (p=0.03).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion:</head><p>Intraoperative cerebral monitoring with BIS can predict postoperative delirium when a BIS reduction of 25-30% is observed. Several confounding factors likely affected the reported BIS values, but if these findings are confirmed by additional research, they would translate to improved quality of care, Explanations of these findings are speculative with regard to the underlying mechanisms and larger studies are warranted to clarify these issues. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comments:</head><p>Apart from decreased incidence of postoperative delirium, it was found that the time to onset of delirium was significantly prolonged (mean, 0.5 day longer) and the number of delirium-free days was significantly increased (mean, 0.1 day more) by haloperidol prophylaxis.</p><p>Because haloperidol can relieve certain symptoms of delirium (agitation or hyperactive symptoms), it is possible that patients receiving haloperidol might temporarily have their delirious symptoms masked during and immediately after the period of drug infusion, thus increasing the measure of delirium-free time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>-no baseline cognitive tests -intraoperative parameters were different -placebo delirium incidence lower than anticipated  The Risk Model for Delirium was designed with a cut-off point of 5; patients scoring 5 or more points were considered high-risk patients.</p><p>The high risk group was prescribed 1 mg haloperidol 2 x day for delirium prophylaxis When patients developed a delirium, they were fully assessed to exclude a somatic cause and treated by the psychiatric department.  <ref type="bibr">: 4.25 (2.65-6.80</ref>) p&lt; 0.001 5.8% vs 2.0% RR: 1.60 (1.12-2.26) p= 0.050 23.1% vs 8.3% RR: 1.69 (1.37-2.10) p&lt; 0.001 37.0% vs 14.6% RR: 1.77 (1.45-2.17) p&lt; 0.001</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion:</head><p>Prescribing prophylactic haloperidol to high risk patients as identified by the Risk Model for Delirium did not reduce delirium incidence in a cohort of hip fracture patients. The RD score did prove to be an accurate tool for identifying high risk patients with poorer outcome regarding delirium incidence, length of stay and return to pre-fracture living situation. Studies of delirium should also try and measure, and screen for, dementia.</p></div>

A dedicated geriatric unit is not required A unique strength of the program is the targeting of common, modifiable, evidence-based risk factors that are relevant to older hospitalized patients using interventions to be feasible and generalizable to other settings. Effectiveness of the program has been demonstrated through research studies for prevention of delirium and cognitive and functional decline. The HELP program is readily adaptable to other hospital settings. Barriers to implementation in other settings -institutional support for start up personnel and equipment -changing ingrained geriatric practices -developing support from key nursing and physician personnel -ongoing clinical personnel training -frequent turnover of personnel -recruitment (extensive) training and retention of volunteers Notes for 0 Quality Scores and Unclear Not applicable Unclear Not applicable Low Unclear Non-concurrent controls from prior RCT BIAS RATING = Unclear</cell></row></table><note><p><p>4.

The use of opiates and sedatives (for the "double effect") which reduces the need for benzodiazepines or propofol may be prudent. Considering that delirium is a predictor of death and other adverse outcomes, investigators should consider prospective interventional studies to determine whether differing management strategies or selection of sedative/analgesic agents are associated with reductions in delirium and other short-and long-term clinical outcomes. Limitations -the list of covariates was not all-inclusive; excluding -renal/hepatic dysfunction -hypoxemia -sleep deprivation -more frequent delirium assessments would have allowed better tracking of cognitive status -used administered drug dose rather than plasma concentrations -excluded observations without accompanying assess-ments -only cursory evaluations of antipsychotics and anticholinergics RATING WORKSHEET Conclusion: QUALITY / RISK OF BIAS Evidence Ratings [adapted based on Quality Score 1 or 0</cell></row></table><note><p><p></p>Risk of Bias: Based on the criteria from 1-6 only, give a Cochrane rating of bias, as follows: o Low risk of bias: Low risk of bias on all 6 domains o Unclear risk of bias: High or unclear risk of bias on 1 or more of 6 domains o High risk of bias: High risk of bias on 2 or more of 6 domains REVISED 11/11/13</p></note></figure>

Men/women = 36/14 Age: 65 to 70 yr 39 (78%) &gt;70 yr 11 (22%) Intervention (see above) Patients in the placebo group who experienced delirium were given 0.5 mg oral risperidone every 12 h, and if symptoms were not controlled, the dose could be increased to 4 mg/d. In either group, haloperidol was used as a second line rescue medication if symptoms were not controlled with risperidone in a daily dose of 4 mg. Haloperidol was begun orally at 0.5 mg q8h and could be escalated to 10 mg/d if needed. Rescue medications were started once the diagnosis of delirium was confirmed, and the dosage could be escalated by doubling the dose at 24-h intervals, if needed, until symptoms were controlled or the maximum dosage limit was attained. Rescue medications were continued for 24h after a score of 0 was achieved on the ICDSC.

The incidence of clinical delirium observed in the current study was 23.8%. Neither the ICDSC nor the CAM-ICU has been validated for severity scoring of delirium, so the highest score on the ICDSC was reported in the current study as a measure of severity, taking advantage of the ordinal framework of this scale. it is probable that the study had low power to detect a statistically significant difference between the two groups with regard to ICU, hospital length of stay, duration of delirium, highest score on the ICDSC, or consumption of antipsychotic medications.

Study Characteristics Population Intervention Groups Results Comments Measure Outcome Cole MG 2002 Canada Setting 5 medical units -University Hospital Study Design randomized trial Randomization method Computer generated random numbers (stratified within groups of prevalent and incident and blocks of different sizes to preserve blinding Study Length/Start-Stop Dates 3/1996 to 1/1999 Purpose To determine whether systematic detection and multidisciplinary care of delirium in older patients admitted to a general medical unit could reduce delirium in older patients and could reduce time to improvement in cognitive status. Secondarily to reduce symptoms of delirium, increase independence and rate of discharge to the community. Also to improve survival during 8 weeks after enrollment , decrease hospital lengths of stay and improve outcomes for incident and prevalent delilrium with and without dementia. 1. Consultation and follow up by geriatric internist or psychiatrist -determine predisposing, precipitating and perpetuating factors of delirium -made management recommendations 2. Follow up by study nurse -daily visit (mean 35.7 min) -assure implementation of recommendations -assure nursing protocol implementation (see Table 1 in PDF) -meet with/involve patient family Delirium assessment: CAM SPMSQ (dx DSM III R) Baseline characteristics Primary outcomes Prevalent delirium NS risk if prevalent Incident delirium Delirium + dementia NS for delirium + no dementia Improvement in MMSE score Severity of illness score Charlson comorbidity index NS for less comorbidity Time to improvement Delirium Index Score Screened at admission by SPMSQ and CAM by nurses for prevalent delirium and 1 week later for incident delirium before randomization; CAME and MMSE inter-rater reliability "excellent" No significant difference between groups Intervention vs usual care No significant difference between groups for any outcome 80.5% vs 80.7% 1.15 (0.48-2.79) 19.5% vs 19.3% 59.3% vs 56.1% HR 1.54 (0.82-2.97) 48% vs 45% 5.8 (1.2) vs 5.8 (1.3) 3.2 (2.2) vs 3.3 (2.1) HR 1.36 (0.75-2.46) NS trend toward shorter time for intervention group 48% vs 45% HR 1.10 (0.74-1.63) 8.34 (3.87) vs 7.36 (3.49) HR 1.09 (0.74-1.60) The results of the efficacy analysis did not differ from the main analysis Changes from prior study: -more intensive -consultant followed patients -study nurse visited 5 x week -study team (2 geriatric internists, 2 geriatric psychiatrists, study nurse) met to discuss delirium management problems -primary investigator met weekly with study nurse to discuss dx, enrollment, interventions. There were no deviations from the planned study protocol Delirium may be an epiphenomenon related to the severity of medical illness; consequently the psychosocial component of the intervention may have been superfluous In the absence of an effective intervention strategy for prevalent or incident delirium in older patients, research efforts should focus on prevention of delirium in this population. This might involve identification of potentially modifiable predisposing or precipitating risk factors for prevalent delirium and evaluation of interventions aimed at risk factor abatement. n = 114 Usual care group n = 114 received yusual care n = 2 withdrawn n = 112 completed trial Men and women (50%) Mean age 82.0 (7.1) Usual care -standard hospital services -consultation requests honored -no systematic follow up by geriatric specialists or nurse if consultation provided -dx of delirium not provided to hospital staff Delirium assessment: Baseline characteristics Primary outcomes See above See above See above RATING WORKSHEET Evidence Ratings [adapted based on Cochrane risk of bias (top 6 items only), Jadad scoring and Lancet review approach Inouye et al] Quality Score 1 or 0 [include notes for any 0s] Risk of Bias Rating (Low; Unclear, High) [include notes on interpretation] Notes for 0 Quality Scores and Risk of Bias Interpretation 1.

Good, comprehensive geriatric treatment is justified in this patient group because of more effective alleviation of delirium and improved cognition. However, individual cases deserve careful tailoring of treatment and evaluation whether they benefit from active, curative treatment or good palliative care.</p></note></figure>

Patients assigned to intervention had shorter duration of delirium and left the hospital with better functional status. Robust outcomes can be achieved with the coordinated efforts of multiple disciplines dedicated to the survival and mental and physical recovery of critically ill patients receiving mechanical ventilation. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>See above</head><p>Comments: No ITT analysis. Preoperative misrepresentation in 5 (17.9%) patients who developed delirium in the olanzapine-treated group and 1 (1.2%), may have resulted in alcohol withdrawal in the patients analyzed in this study. The high incidence of abnormally low albumin levels occurred in the olanzapine-treated patients. Olanzapine treated patients also used less narcotic medication suggesting it may have reduced the need for analgesics . Conclusion: Administration of 10 mg of oral olanzapine perioperative vs placebo was associated with a significantly lower incidence of delirium. Olanzapine reduced the incidence of delirium, but not its severity or duration. These findings suggest that olanzapine prophylaxis of postoperative delirium may be an effective strategy. . </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>See above</head><p>Comments: This prospective study is the first systematic evaluation of the use of prophylactic administration of intravenous haloperidol to reduce the occurrence of postoperative delirium. The mechanism by which haloperidol reduces the occurrence of postoperative delirium is not clear. Some studies suggest that actions other than the blockade of central dopamine receptors may be responsible for haloperidol's calming effect in patients with delirium.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion:</head><p>These results suggest that daily postoperative administration of haloperidol can reduce the occurrence of postoperative delirium safely.   Comments: Defining normal cognitive function as the absence of delirium and coma in a patient is an inevitable constraint because it is not possible to be confident in delineating the cause of coma as disorder or drugs in many ICU patients. Patients who died within 14 days were assessed with zero delirium-free, coma-free days to manage the possible conflicting effects of haloperidol on delirium and survival in the same way that days alive and free from mechanical ventilation are used as an outcome measure in treatments for adult respiratory distress syndrome Conclusion: These results do not support the hypothesis that haloperidol modifies duration of delirium in critically ill patients. Although haloperidol can be used safely in this population of patients, pending the results of trials in progress, the use of intravenous haloperidol should be reserved for short-term management of acute agitation.</p></div>
