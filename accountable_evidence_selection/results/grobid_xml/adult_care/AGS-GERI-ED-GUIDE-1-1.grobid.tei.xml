<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>According to the 2010 Census, more than 40 million Americans were over the age of 65, which was "more people than in any previous census." In addition, "between 2000 and 2010, the population 65 years and over increased at a faster rate than the total U.S. population." The census data also demonstrated that the population 85 and older is growing at a rate almost three times the general population. The subsequent increased need for health care for this burgeoning geriatric population represents an unprecedented and overwhelming challenge to the American health care system as a whole and to emergency departments (EDs) specifically. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> Geriatric EDs began appearing in the United States in 2008 and have become increasingly common. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> The ED is uniquely positioned to play a role in improving care to the geriatric population. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> As an ever-increasing access point for medical care, the ED sits at a crossroads between inpatient and outpatient care (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> Specifically, the ED represents 57% of hospital admissions in the United States, of which almost 70% receive a non-surgical diagnosis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> The expertise which an ED staff can bring to an encounter with a geriatric patient can meaningfully impact not only a patient's condition, but can also impact the decision to utilize relatively expensive inpatient modalities, or less expensive outpatient treatments. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> Emergency medicine experts recognize similar challenges around the world. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> Geriatric ED core principles have been described in the United Kingdom. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. The central role of the ED in geriatric health care in contemporary medicine (reproduced with permission from TeamHealth's Patient Care Continuum Model.) Furthermore, as the initial site of care for both inpatient and outpatient events, the care provided in the ED has the opportunity to "set the stage" for subsequent care provided. More accurate diagnoses and improved therapeutic measures can not only expedite and improve inpatient care and outcomes, but can effectively guide the allocation of resources towards a patient population that, in general, utilizes significantly more resources per event than younger populations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> Geriatric ED patients represent 43% of admissions, including 48% admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> On average, the geriatric patient has an ED length of stay that is 20% longer and they use 50% more lab/imaging services than younger populations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> In addition, Geriatric ED patients are 400% more likely to require social services. Despite the focus on geriatric acute care in the ED manifest by disproportionate use of resources, these patients frequently leave the ED dissatisfied and optimal outcomes are not consistently attained. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> Despite the fact that the geriatric patient population accounts for a large, and ever increasing, proportion of ED visits, the contemporary emergency medicine management model may not be adequate for geriatric adults. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> A number of challenges face emergency medicine to effectively and reliably improve post-ED geriatric adult outcomes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> Multiple studies demonstrate ED physicians' perceptions about inadequate geriatric emergency care model training. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> Many common geriatric ED problems remain underresearched leaving uncertainty in optimal management strategies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> In addition, quality indicators for minimal standard geriatric ED care continue to evolve. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> Older adults with multiple medical co-morbidities, often multiple medications, and complex physiologic changes present even greater challenges. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> Programs specifically designed to address these concerns are a realistic opportunity to improve care. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> Similar programs designed for other age groups (pediatrics) or directed towards specific diseases (STEMI, stroke, and trauma) have improved care both in individual EDs and system-wide, resulting in better, more cost effective care and ultimately better patient outcomes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> GERIATRIC ED PURPOSE</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Purpose</head><p>The purpose of these Geriatric Emergence Department Guidelines is to provide a standardized set of guidelines that can effectively improve the care of the geriatrics population which can be implemented in the ED. These guidelines create a template for staffing, equipment, education, policies and procedures, follow-up care, and performance improvement measures. When implemented collectively, a geriatric ED can expect to see improvements in patient care, customer service, and staff satisfaction. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> Improved attention to the needs of this challenging population has the opportunity to more effectively allocate health care resources, optimize admission and readmission rates, while simultaneously decreasing iatrogenic complications and the resultant increased length-of-stay and decreased reimbursement.</p><p>A goal of the geriatric ED is to recognize those patients who will benefit from inpatient care, and to effectively implement outpatient care to those who do not require inpatient resources. To implement most effectively, the geriatric ED will utilize the resources of the hospital, ED and inpatient, as well as outpatient resources. Making effective and expedient outpatient arrangements available to the geriatric population is of critical importance to the care of this population, recognizing that acute inpatient events are often accompanied by functional decline, increased dependency and increased morbidity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> By using providers, including nurse practitioners, nurses, social workers, physician assistants, and physicians to coordinate care in the ED, the inpatient units, and during the immediate post-ED discharge period, the geriatric ED creates the opportunity to care for geriatric patients in the environment most conducive to a positive outcome.</p><p>The benefits of the Geriatric ED to the geriatric patient population are multiple and clear. By focusing attention and resources on the most common needs of the geriatric ED patient, care can be optimized. The benefit of a Geriatric ED to a hosting hospital can be multiple as well. These improved patient care standards can become a significant marketing tool for hospitals looking to reach out to the Medicare population and partner with extended care facilities. A Geriatric ED can market the ED to attract a patient population that may also utilize higher reimbursing hospital-based programs, including cardiac, orthopedic, and neurologic care. Further, with Medicare reimbursements decreasing and payment for iatrogenic complications such as wounds, catheter associated infections, etc. impacting hospital reimbursement; the need for special attention to geriatric needs has become even more pressing.</p><p>The term "geriatric" has had different definitions over the past decades. In 1985, the term "oldest old" was coined to identify those 85 years of age and older. Later Fries, et al defined three groups by dividing the older adult population into the young old (often 65-74), the middle old (75-85) and the oldest old (&gt;85). <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> The World Health Organization defined the older population starting at age 60. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> Our guidelines used the construct that age 65 and older would be the geriatric population served by the Geriatric ED. Many hospitals may find that using the age 65 and older does not match the needs of their population and available resources. It may be most appropriate that each hospital identify the age for patients to be seen in their Geriatric ED. Through the continuum of physiologic aging complexity of health care issues increase and as such, the benefits of a Geriatric ED increase concurrently. The age range to be a patient in the Geriatric ED can be based on the literature, meaning age 60 or 65, or can be defined by the specific hospital community. One hospital uses age 55 based on when resources are available; another uses 65 years of age and another uses 75 years of age as the beginning age range for their Geriatric ED.</p><p>The recommendations found in this packet represent research and consensus-based best practices from the perspectives of the American College of Emergency Physicians, Society for Academic Emergency Medicine, American Geriatrics Society, and Emergency Nurses Association. With implementation of the following recommendations, hospitals, regardless of size, will positively impact the care of the geriatric emergency patients.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>STAFFING/ADMINISTRATION</head><p>The Geriatric ED staff and administration provides a multi-disciplinary team of care providers focused on the varying needs of the geriatric population. By providing trained staff in the ED, as well as readily available staff for inpatient care and outpatient follow up, the Geriatric ED can optimize ED visits, effectively deliver and/or coordinate care in a less costly and more comfortable outpatient setting when appropriate, and coordinate inpatient resources for highrisk patients. An effective program will involve hospital site-specific staff as well as overall local coordination resources.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>Although published studies have not been clear on outcomes resulting from staffing modifications for the care of geriatric patients, they have demonstrated high levels of endorsement for ED staffing enhancements in general (94%), for the availability of specialized nurses (85%), pharmacists (74%), social workers (88%), geriatric consults (79%) and a designated professional to coordinate geriatric services (91%). There were moderate levels of endorsement for the availability of physical therapy (59%) and occupational therapy (53%). <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> One common approach to enhanced older adult ED staffing in the literature is the use of geriatric consultation services in the ED. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> Yuen, et al. found that over 26 months, there were 2202 geriatric consultations (85 per month), with admission avoided in 85% (47% discharged home, 38% admitted to a "convalescent hospital"). <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref> Foo and colleagues evaluated geriatric assessment and intervention prior to discharge of geriatric patients from an ED observation unit. In the intervention group, 72% of patients had unrecognized needs requiring intervention. This group had fewer ED revisits (IRR 0.59) and hospital admissions (IRR 0.64) at 12 months. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> However, results are not consistent across studies. Sinoff et al also evaluated an ED geriatric consult service and found a significantly higher admission rate (64%), with a 2-year mortality of 34% and institutionalization rate of 52%. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> Social workers and case managers are essential to efficient geriatric ED management. Effective geriatric case management strategies continue to evolve. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> Innovative models using volunteers to assess geriatric ED patients have also been evaluated and are acceptable to ED nurses and physicians. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recommendations</head><p>• The Geriatric ED will have staffing protocols in place to provide for geriatric-trained providers, including physician and nurse leadership and ancillary services. These protocols should include plans for times when such services may not be available.</p><p>• Staff members of the Geriatric ED will participate in educational/training to ensure high-quality geriatric care.</p><p>• Although departments may differ in the availability of staffing resources, departments should have available the following positions either as part of a hospital-based Acute Care of Elders (ACE) team or specific for the ED: Geriatric Emergency Department Medical Director Qualifications: • Best practiced by a board-certified emergency physician with training in geriatrics • Completion of eight hours of geriatric appropriate CME every two years Responsibilities: • Member of hospital ED and Medicine committee • Oversight of geriatric performance improvement program • Liaison with Medical Staff for geriatric care concerns • Liaison with outpatient care partners including Skilled Nursing Facilities (SNFs), Board and Care facilities, home health providers, etc. • Identify needs for staff education and implement educational programs when appropriate. • Review, approve, and assist in the development of all hospital geriatric policies and procedures Geriatric Emergency Department Nurse Manager Qualifications: • At least two years of experience in geriatrics (or in an ED that sees geriatric patients) within the previous five years • Experience with QI programs is recommended • Completion of eight hours of Board of Registered Nursing (BRN) approved continuing education units (CEU) in geriatric topics every two years. Responsibilities: • Participate in the development and maintenance of a geriatric performance improvement program • Liaison with outpatient care partners including, but not limited to SNFs, Board and Care facilities, home health providers, etc. • Member of selected hospital-based ED and/or medicine committees • Identify needs for staff education and implement educational programs when appropriate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Staff Physicians</head><p>Provide twenty-four hour ED coverage or directly supervised by physicians functioning as emergency physicians. This includes senior residents practicing at their respective hospitals only.</p><p>Staff physicians are encouraged to participate in geriatric specific education with a goal of 4 hours of CME annually specifically focused on the care of geriatric patients.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Staff Nurses</head><p>Nursing staff is encouraged to participate in geriatric specific education.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Medical Staff Specialists</head><p>Specialists will be available for consultation either by established medical staff policies or by prearranged transfer arrangements. Although each hospital's medical staff will support different specialist services, it is recommended that the Geriatric ED have access to:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">• Geriatrics • Cardiology • General Surgery • GI</formula><p>Ancillary Services</p><p>• Case management and social services • Mid-level provider/physician extenders (optional, but recommended) • Occupational/Physical therapists • Pharmacists • Neurology • Orthopedists • Psychiatry, preferably with a geriatric specialty • Radiology</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FOLLOW UP AND TRANSITION OF CARE</head><p>Acute hospitalization is associated with increased rates of acute delirium, nosocomial infections, iatrogenic complications, and functional declines in the geriatric adult. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref> Thus, one of the main goals of the Geriatric ED is to decrease hospital admissions. Making effective and expedient outpatient arrangements available to the geriatric population is of critical importance to the care of this population. However, discharge from the ED to the community presents significant challenges to the geriatric population.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>Published studies on ED-based interventions with improved access to community resources have had mixed results. Most demonstrate little effect of these interventions on either ED utilization or prevention of complications. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> However, effective transition of care is clearly required to facilitate outpatient care after an ED evaluation. This transition process presents many challenges. In an era of daily ED crowding, effective, reliable discharge instructions are a challenge to all populations, particularly for the geriatric population. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49</ref> Older ED patients identify misinformation as a primary course of dissatisfaction with their emergency care, a problem confounded and magnified by ongoing under-recognition of cognitive dysfunction, lower health literacy, and financial impediments for prescriptions and recommended outpatient follow-up. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recommendations</head><p>• The Geriatric ED will have discharge protocols in place that facilitate the communication of clinically relevant information to the patient/family and outpatient care providers, including nursing homes. Essential information to optimize continuity of care at the time of discharge should include the following data elements:</p><p>• Presenting complaints</p><p>• Test results and interpretation</p><p>• ED therapy and clinical response</p><p>• Consultation Notes (in person or via telephone) in ED</p><p>• Working discharge diagnosis</p><p>• ED physician note, or copy of dictation</p><p>• New prescriptions and alterations with long-term medications</p><p>• Follow-up plan Clinical information will be presented in a format in a way best suited for elder adults:</p><p>• Large font discharge instructions</p><p>• Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliant copied discharge instructions should be provided to family and care providers.</p><p>The Geriatric ED will have a process in place that effectively provides appropriate outpatient follow up either via provider-to-patient communication or the provision of direct follow up clinical evaluation.</p><p>• Although telephone follow up is the most commonly used, the use of newer technology, including telemedicine alternatives is recommended.</p><p>The Geriatric ED will maintain relationships and resources in the community that can be used by patients on discharge to facilitate care.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>• Medical follow up</head><p>• Primary MD or "medical home"</p><p>• Case Manager to assist with compliance with follow up • Safety Assessments Although a goal of the Geriatric ED should be to maintain older adults in their own homes whenever possible, some patients will require either short term or long term placement into facilities when care cannot be provided appropriately at home. Thus, the Geriatric ED should have available community resources for the placement of patients to the appropriate level of care, including nursing homes, rehab facilities, board and cares, etc.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EDUCATION</head><p>The success of the Geriatric ED program rests largely on the education of a multi-disciplinary staff directed toward the needs of the geriatric population. Residency and continuing medical education must take into account the unique physiology, atypical disease presentations, and psychosocial needs of older persons. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53</ref> Education and training evaluation of emergency personnel should be competency-based. The curriculum should contain interdisciplinary content, and learners should be assessed for interdisciplinary core competencies. Effective instructional methods include a mix of didactic lectures, case conferences, case simulations, clinical audits, journal clubs, web-based materials, and supervised patient care. Hands-on training is strongly preferred by many learners. Education may be effectively organized around the assessment of common and important geriatric chief complaints.</p><p>A Geriatric ED educational program is expected to include an initial initiative directed towards program implementation, increasing staff awareness of the geriatric population's needs, and specific policy and procedure initiatives. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54</ref> Educational programs can be created and implemented internally (specific for each hospital), as part of a larger CME program, or through participation in externally created programs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>An educational program should include:</head><p>• Initial "go-live" implementation sessions • Involvement of multi-disciplinary teams including hospital-based leadership and outpatient resources.</p><p>• Geriatric emergency medicine didactic sessions for physician, nursing, and multi-disciplinary staff focused on geriatric care issues to be assessed and managed in the Geriatric ED.</p><p>• In-service education on geriatric-specific equipment.</p><p>• Program introduction for community based organizations caring for geriatric patients with opportunity for input.</p><p>• Community awareness, involvement, and outreach</p><p>• Emergency Medical Services (EMS) personnel perceive a deficit in their training as it relates to care of older patients, particularly in the areas of education and psychosocial issues. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55</ref> The Geriatric ED should provide training for EMS personnel who rescue and transport older persons to their facilities. <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57</ref> • The Geriatric ED should also provide educational self-management materials for older adults and their families.</p><p>• Regular educational assessment and implementation of site-specific educational needs</p><p>• QI data review with process improvement implementation.</p><p>• Periodic education/re-education of disease specific presentations with updates on policy/procedure changes, community care programs, etc.</p><p>• An important educational goal is to provide familiarity with use of quick, bedside assessment tools.</p><p>Educational needs will be assessed on an ongoing basis by the Geriatric Medical Director and Geriatric Liaison nurse and implemented as needed based on staff needs. As the program grows and the competency of staff changes over time, it is expected that educational needs will change. It is highly recommended that education be coordinated with peer review cases, based on cases experienced in the local ED.</p><p>Although educational content should be tailored to individual department needs, recommended content includes the following:</p><p>• Atypical presentations of disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref> • Trauma, including falls and hip fracture <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref> • Cognitive and behavioral disorders <ref type="bibr">23, 58-60, 62, 66-72</ref> • Modifications for older patients of emergent interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> • Medication management <ref type="bibr">23, 58-62, 66-69, 71</ref> • Transitions of care and referrals to services <ref type="bibr">23, 60, 61, 67-69, 71, 73</ref> • Pain management and palliative care <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">66,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">74</ref> • Effect of comorbid conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58</ref> • Functional impairments and disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">71</ref> • Management of the group of diseases peculiar to the geriatric adult, including conditions causing abdominal pain <ref type="bibr">58-60, 62, 66-68, 75</ref> • Weakness and dizziness <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">76</ref> • Iatrogenic injuries <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">67,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">68,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">77</ref> • Cross-cultural issues involving older patients in the emergency setting <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63</ref> • Elder abuse and neglect <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">66,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">71</ref> • Ethical issues, including advance directives <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">69,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">78</ref> QUALITY IMPROVEMENT Implement an effective Quality Improvement (QI) program with the goal to collect and monitor data (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>) in a manner conducive to staff education and program success.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES</head><p>Geriatric patient care requires equipment designed for a patient population with specific needs. Challenges involving mobility, incontinence, behavioral needs, etc. are best met with equipment designed for the effective and comfortable evaluation and treatment of geriatric patients, while minimizing iatrogenic complications. The physical plant of a Geriatric ED should focus on structural modifications that promote improvements in safety, comfort, mobility, memory cues, and sensorial perception both with vision and hearing for elders in the ED. Common key features are those that enhance lighting, colors, enhanced signage -all of these are better, not only for older adults, but for everyone. Although a separate space within an ED, or a separate ED entirely, devoted to geriatrics may be beneficial, most hospitals will be more capable of effectively implementing a program in which any ED bed can be made "geriatric friendly" with the presence of the equipment and supplies listed.</p><p>The list below is a suggested starting point for the design and equipping of a Geriatric ED. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">80</ref> • Furniture improvements:</p><p>• Exam chairs/reclining chairs -may be more comfortable for some geriatric patients and facilitate transfer processes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">81</ref> • Furniture should be selected with sturdy armrests and ED beds at levels that allow patients to rise more easily for safe transferring. Furniture should be selected using the Evidence-Based Design Checklist. Some studies show that patients often fall when trying to get out of bed unsupervised or unassisted. They also show that bedrails do not reduce the amount of falls and may increase the severity of the fall.</p><p>• Extra thick/soft gurney mattress -decreases possible development of skin break down and decubitus ulcer formation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">82</ref> • Choice of upholstery should be soft and moisture proof to protect the fragile skin of older patients'. Should also be selected to reduce surface contamination linked to health care associated infections. "Surfaces are easily cleaned, with no surface joints or seams," "materials for upholstery are impervious," "surfaces are nonporous and smooth." This should hold true especially in the ED where there is a high turnover with a large variety of diseases potentially present.</p><p>• Economic evidence supports early prevention of pressure ulcers in ED patients by the use of pressureredistributing foam mattresses. <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">83</ref> Another alternative that has been shown to reduce pain and improve patient satisfaction is the use of reclining chairs in the ED instead of ED gurney beds. <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">81</ref> • Special equipment</p><p>• Body warming devices/warm blankets • Fluid warmer</p><p>• Non-slip fall mats <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">84</ref> • Bedside commodes -where necessary to minimize fall risk</p><p>• Walking aids/devices <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">85</ref> • Hearing aids <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">86</ref> • Monitoring equipment</p><p>• Respiratory equipment to include a fiberoptic intubation device</p><p>• Restraint devices</p><p>• Urinary catheters to include condom catheters -minimize risk of CAUTI</p><p>• Visual Orientation improvements:</p><p>• Lighting -soft light is recommended, but exposure to natural light is also shown to be beneficial for recovery times and decreasing delirium</p><p>• Light colored walls with a matte sheen and light flooring with a low-glare finish should be used to optimize lighting and reduce glare. While older adults require three to four times as much light as young adults for visual clarity, light scatter also increases with aging eyes.</p><p>Simply increasing the level of lighting can improve acuity, and it is recommended that lighting consist of a combination of ambient and spot lighting. In contrast, glare and shine along with difficulty seeing the edges of pale colored objects have been shown to be impediments for older adults in their ability to function and confusing for those with cognitive impairments. Thus, improvements that increase lighting while reducing glare can include shielding of illuminating fixtures above the upper visual field. Fixtures that bounce light off the ceiling or of walls increase overall room lighting while glare can be reduced with the use of matte surfaces. Uniform indirect light.</p><p>• Patients should have control of the lighting in their space if they wish to sleep at a time when the other lights are on, allowing for fewer sleep disturbances.</p><p>• PATTERNS</p><p>• Contrast sensitivity in aging vision can be both confusing and hinder movement in geriatric patients, especially with reduced depth perception. Patterns that have dominant contrasts may create a sense of vertigo or even seem to vibrate for older adults. Others may misperceive patterns as obstacles or objects (eg, leaf patterns on flooring may be seen as real live leaves to avoid when walking).</p><p>• COLORS</p><p>• Secondary to vision and perception changes, color choice for facilities and structure should be considered. Color can be used to enhance visual function and depth perception. Avoid monochromatic color schemes and allow for colors to contrast between horizontal and vertical surfaces. Similar colors look the same for those with poor vision. Older adults experience a decrease in the ability to differentiate cool colors (greens, blues) as opposed to warm colors (yellows, oranges). In poorly lit areas, yellow is the most visible. Orange and reds are attention grabbing. Blues appear hazy and indistinct and may appear gray due to yellowing of the lens.</p><p>• Acoustic Orientation Improvements -private rooms or acoustically enhanced drapes, if necessary, for better communication and decrease levels of anxiety and delirium</p><p>• An enhanced acoustical environment may facilitate communication between patients and staff and between staff. While older adults may have decreased ability to hear certain words secondary to a loss of hearing in high-frequency ranges, they also have increased sensitivity to loud sounds. The use of sound-absorbing materials (eg, carpet, curtains, ceiling tiles) may reduce background noise and can also increase patient privacy. The use of portable hearing assist devices for patients may also enhance communication. Loud noise sources in the hospital should be reduced (eg, overhead paging, machines). There is an increase in the amount of studies showing how music can decrease anxiety, heart rate and blood pressure. <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">87,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">88</ref> Patients could be provided with a way to listen to music and choose their programming without disturbing others.</p><p>• An enhanced acoustical environment can also increase patient privacy and safety. One study performed in an ED found that "percent of the patients in curtained spaces reported they withheld portions of their medical history and refused parts of their physical examination because of lack of privacy. None of the patients in rooms with walls reported withholding information."</p><p>• Enhanced signage -enhance communication</p><p>• Miscellaneous safety enhancements</p><p>• Doors should be fitted with handles (not round knobs) for ease of use Hospitals are expected to utilize their existing resources to meet the needs of this population. With minimal additional expense for equipment suggested above, geriatric care can be optimized.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>POLICIES, PROCEDURES AND PROTOCOLS</head><p>The policies, procedures, and protocols listed are recommended as a comprehensive, directed, although not exhaustive, approach to many of the challenges involved in the care of geriatric patients in the ED. Emergency departments are encouraged to use, change, or integrate their local policies, procedures, and protocols whenever possible. These policies should be available to be referenced by staff and should be followed as part of the routine care of patients. Although many patients in this population are functional, independent, and generally in good health, it has been shown that a visit to the ED, even for a relatively minor issue, may be a "red flag" event heralding functional decline and the potential need for added health resources. Other patients in this population are frailer. In general, these patients will require longer ED and hospital lengths-of-stay and consume more health care resources than their younger cohorts. Screening of this population in the ED may allow an opportunity to intervene in those patients who require added resources to help improve outcomes.</p><p>Previously published studies on the use of prognostic screening tools in this patient population have mixed results. <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[89]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[90]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[91]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[92]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[93]</ref> What seems to be clear though is that a team driven, simple to use screening tool can be powerful in helping act to prevent poor outcomes and improve the ED and hospital experience for the geriatric patient. <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[94]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[95]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[96]</ref> Goals of an effective screening program include the prevention or limitation of delirium, prevention of functional decline, prevention of iatrogenic injury including adverse drug events and falls, as well as a more effective transition of care through the care cycle from outpatient to ED to inpatient and back again to outpatient.</p><p>Policy: It is the policy of the Geriatric ED to screen all geriatric patients for high-risk features.

Between 1990 and 2002 hospital admissions for urinary tract infections soared to 16% of all hospital admissions. Urinary tract infections associated with urinary tract catheter insertion account for the highest percentage (80%) of hospital and health care associated infections and approximately 1 in 5 patients being admitted to the hospital receive an indwelling catheter at some point. <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[99]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[100]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">[101]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">[102]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">[103]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">[104]</ref> The risk of urinary tract infection from an indwelling catheter increase about 5% per day and a small portion of these patients develop bacteremia and sepsis as a result of indwelling urinary tract catheters with a significant increase in health expenditures and length of stay. <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">100,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">103,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">104</ref> Several studies suggest that many of these urinary tract catheters are inappropriately placed and needlessly expose patients to the inherent risk of catheter placement without benefit. <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">[105]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[106]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[107]</ref> The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has identified these health care-associated infections as preventable and have recommended that hospitals take measures to minimize the catheter related infections. <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">103</ref> Several groups have identified specific measures aimed at decreasing the incidence of CAUTIs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">101,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">102,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">104</ref> Yet, despite these proven efforts, national hospital compliance with preventative measures is lacking and lacks uniformity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">108,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">109</ref> Of primary importance is the screening and appropriate identification of patients for indwelling catheter placement, proper technique, educating staff and process improvement measures such as infection rate auditing and limited duration of use (references).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Geriatric Medication Management</head><p>Background: Geriatric patients are at high-risk for adverse events related to medication. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">112,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">113</ref> The aging population tends to take more medications, have more co-morbidities, and have differing responses to medications when compared to their younger cohorts. <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">114</ref> Furthermore, the "normal" aging physiology often leads to changes in metabolism with medications as well as problematic responses to "normal" medication dosing.</p><p>Polypharmacy in this population is especially problematic. <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">113,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">115</ref> Population studies have indicated that 40% of patients greater than 65 years of age take 5-9 medications daily, and 18% take more than 10. If you consider there is a 50-60% chance of a drug-drug interaction when taking 5 medications and a 90% chance of a drug-drug interaction when taking 10 or more medications, the burden of medications on the evaluation and care of the geriatric population seems clear.</p><p>Overall, adverse medication events not only represent a major cause of ED visits and hospital admissions, they can also lead to increased patient morbidity and mortality, increased resource utilization and increased overall ED and hospital length-of-stay. <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">[115]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">[116]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">[117]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">[118]</ref> Current "medication reconciliation" procedures are a good start towards addressing this issue, but do not go far enough in the management of medications in the geriatric population.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Geriatric Fall Assessment</head><p>Background: Trauma is one of the leading causes of death in the geriatric population. Falls, even relatively minor impact falls, often represent a major traumatic mechanism in the geriatric population and can lead to significant morbidity and mortality compared to younger patients. As the population continues to age these falls will continue to increase disproportionately to other age groups. In fact, over a five-year period between 2005 and 2009, fall-related visits to the ED increased approximately 37.5%. <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">119</ref> These falls are increasingly common, occurring in up to 1/3 of the population over 65 years old and surge to 51% in those older than 85. <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">120</ref> Furthermore, the financial burden of fall-related injuries and hospitalizations are estimated to be more than 28 billion dollars each year. <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">[120]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">[121]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">[122]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b121">[123]</ref> The appropriate evaluation of a patient who either has fallen or is at high risk of falling involves not only a thorough assessment for traumatic injuries, but an assessment of the cause of the fall and an estimation of future fall risk. This assessment is often a complex and time consuming evaluation and usually involves a multifaceted and multi-disciplined approach. For those geriatric patients who present to the ED after a fall, traumatic injuries may be "occult," presenting without "classic" signs or symptoms. High-risk injuries such as blunt head trauma, spinal fractures and hip fractures warrant a higher degree of suspicion and extensive workups. <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">[124]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b123">[125]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b124">[126]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b125">[127]</ref> Furthermore, the cause of the fall is often multifactorial, resulting from a complex combination of causes, described as the "geriatric syndrome."</p><p>The goal of the evaluation of a patient who has fallen or is at increased risk of falling is therefore to diagnose and treat traumatic injuries, discover and manage the predisposing causes of the fall, and ultimately to prevent complications of falling and future falls. Unfortunately, predicting future falls in geriatric ED patients is challenging. <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">128</ref> The ED plays a critical role in initiating appropriate evaluation, disposition, and follow up in order to meet these goals. <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">[129]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b128">[130]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b129">[131]</ref> However, in spite of this safety-net position within the health care system, few fall assessments are initiated appropriately from the ED. <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">132</ref> Studies have shown that having appropriate policies and procedures in place can play a pivotal role in increasing the detection of at-risk seniors and possibly prevent future falls and injuries. <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">133,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b132">134</ref> Policy: It is the policy of the Geriatric ED to initiate a comprehensive evaluation for geriatric patients presenting after a fall or for those who may be at high risk for a future fall. Patients will be evaluated for injuries, including those injuries that may be "occult" in the geriatric population. Furthermore, patients will be evaluated for causes of and risk factors for falls. Patients will be assessed prior to disposition for safety with the goal to prevent further injury and falls.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Required Resources:</head><p>• Fall risk assessment tool: Although many hospitals have a comprehensive fall assessment tool for inpatients, these are often not appropriate for implementation in the ED setting. <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">135,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b134">136</ref> An appropriate tool is a direct, easily implemented tool to screen for risk of falls.

Several dementia screening instruments have been validated in ED settings. <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">155</ref> When done well, this assessment can lead to directed interventions that can positively affect the duration of the patient's hospitalization. The features that distinguish dementia and delirium are presented in the Table . Often the cause of a delirium is multifactorial, including acute medical illness overlying baseline cognitive dysfunction, medication effects and interactions, and decompensating co-morbidities. An appropriate evaluation and management of each of these factors is critical to a positive outcome. <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">156</ref> Another challenge for the ED is the effective management of agitated geriatric patients. Medications and restraints (both chemical and physical) are critical interventions that, when used well, can improve patient health and safety, but when used inappropriately can actually increase the severity or length of a delirium. Fundamentally, the treatment of the geriatric patient with this concern is very different from that of a younger patient with similar concerns.</p><p>Policy: It is the policy of the Geriatric ED to comprehensively evaluate geriatric adults presenting with delirium, encephalopathy, or an altered mental status. Coordination of care, with special attention to directing interventions towards improving reversible causes and limiting factors that extend or cause delirium is the main goal.</p><p>It is the policy of the Geriatric ED to limit the use of chemical and physical restraints to only those situations in which they are absolutely necessary. Appropriate use of medications and alternative safety measures will be maximized to manage the agitated geriatric patient. <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">156</ref> Procedure: Validated screening tools will be used to identify patients presenting with dementia and delirium. The assessment for delirium will use a two-step process. Step 1 (Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>) is the highly sensitive delirium triage screen. Step 2 is the highly specific Brief Confusion Assessment Method. <ref type="bibr" target="#b155">157</ref> A variety of ED-appropriate dementia and mild cognitive impairment screening instruments have been validated, but all are most useful to reduce the probability of non-delirium cognitive impairment (dementia or mild cognitive impairment) rather than to rule-in the diagnosis. An assessment for dementia should be conducted after delirium screening. One of the most accurate dementia screening instruments is reproduced below in Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">155,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b156">158</ref>  Figure 5.
