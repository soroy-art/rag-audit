<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">| Introduction</head><p>The 2023 American Geriatrics Society (AGS) Beers Criteria® and its preceding versions identify medications whose potential for harm outweighs their intended benefit in older adults compared with readily available alternatives <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. However, clinicians, patients, and caregivers need guidance not only on what therapies to avoid, but on alternative non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic treatment strategies to consider in place of such potentially inappropriate medications. An initial version of such a list of alternatives was published in 2015, addressing medications from the 2012 AGS Beers Criteria® that were included in quality measures used by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to evaluate quality of care provided to Medicare beneficiaries <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[2]</ref>. In the interim, several updated versions of the AGS Beers Criteria® have been published, and a decade has passed. To address the evolving nature of the AGS Beers Criteria® and the overall landscape of care, the AGS thus embarked on an effort to provide an updated list of alternative therapies to consider using in place of commonly used medications identified in the 2023 AGS Beers Criteria® and to present these in a way that would be maximally useful to clinicians caring for older adults.</p><p>The list includes common evidence-based alternatives, including non-pharmacologic management strategies that are often safer and equally or more effective than the potentially inappropriate medications they can replace. It does not presume that patients have already tried non-pharmacologic therapies. The list is not intended to be comprehensive or to give detail on deciding between these alternatives or a prioritized order of use; clinical judgment must always be used to determine how the alternatives should be applied to each individual patient. However, brief comments on the relative benefit/safety profile and preferred order of alternatives are noted when there is clear consensus based on clinical practice guidelines and/or expert opinion. Readers are guided to additional resources for more in-depth recommendations. Readers are also provided links to patient guides and other resources for help in implementing these alternative strategies into their clinical practice. The primary target audience is primary care providers, but other important audiences include specialists prescribing within or outside of their specialty.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">| Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">| Selection of AGS Beers Criteria® Medications to Be Addressed</head><p>The alternatives list focuses primarily on commonly used medications from Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref> of the AGS Beers Criteria®, which identifies potentially inappropriate medications to avoid in older adults in most circumstances <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. A draft subset of medications from the AGS Beers Criteria® Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref> to consider for this alternatives effort was developed by the panel co-chairs and was later reviewed, updated, and approved by the full expert panel, with a focus on selecting medications that are commonly used and sufficiently clinically straightforward such that a brief description of alternatives is feasible. For each included medication, the panel identified the clinical conditions in older adults for which these medications are commonly used and categorized medications by those conditions, recognizing that some medications on the AGS Beers Criteria® appear in more than one condition category.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">| Panel Composition</head><p>The AGS Beers Criteria® Alternatives Panel included 19 interprofessional members drawn from Clinical Psychology, Medicine, Nursing, Pharmacy, and Physical Therapy, including 6 who also served on the 2023 AGS Beers Criteria® panel (Appendix 1). In constructing the panel, the co-chairs and AGS staff aimed to achieve a mix of members with specialized knowledge of clinical topics along with generalists who could provide a broader perspective. Selection aimed to identify two or three people per topic, including at least one person with clinical expertise or specialization in that area and one generalist. Sometimes, one person could fulfill both roles. Areas of content expertise included cardiology, psychiatry, sleep disorders, diabetes care, pain, pulmonology, urology and urogynecology, gastroenterology, dementia, and delirium, all with additional expertise in the care of older adults. Potential conflicts of interest were disclosed at the beginning of the process and shared at each panel call and are listed in the Conflicts of Interest section of this paper. Panelists were asked to update any potential conflicts throughout the project.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">| Development Process</head><p>Unlike the process used to develop the AGS Beers Criteria®, the development of the Alternatives to Selected Medications in the 2023 American Geriatrics Society Beers Criteria® did not rely on a review of primary studies but rather on existing clinical practice guidelines and associated literature reviews, best-practice guidance, and literature summaries relevant to each drug/condition in question for older adults. The alternatives list refers readers to these sources for additional information (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">S1</ref>).</p><p>The panel convened for a series of conference calls between January 2024 and September 2024. Outside of the full panel calls, work was conducted via emails and small workgroup calls.</p><p>The panel was divided into eight workgroups, each assigned a subset of medications from the AGS Beers Criteria® categorized by conditions these medications are commonly used to treat: insomnia and anxiety; allergy and pruritus; cardiovascular conditions and anticoagulation; pain; delirium, dementia, and Parkinson's disease; diabetes; gastrointestinal syndromes; and genitourinary syndromes.</p><p>Each workgroup worked with a research librarian to identify clinical practice guidelines, best clinical practice statements, and high-quality literature summaries that pertain to the treatment of the conditions of interest in older adults. Given the vast number of potentially eligible guidance documents, the approach to identifying potential documents to review was not comprehensive but pragmatic and based on expert judgment. Searches were guided by the research librarian and expertise of the panelists and included PubMed, as well as but not limited to (1) Turning Research Into Practice (TRIP) database, (2) Epistemonikos database, (3) Guideline Central, and (4) Google Scholar. If there were insufficient practice guidelines or related documents that addressed the key questions of interest, searches were conducted for systematic reviews and meta-analyses relevant to the topic areas.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">| Review of Search Results and Documents, and Drafting List of Alternatives</head><p>After the list of guidance documents was assembled, workgroup members reviewed the list of documents and agreed by consensus on a limited set of these documents to use for review. Criteria</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>• Key points</head><p>○ This document provides guidance on treatment strategies for common clinical conditions in older adults. ○ These treatment strategies, which include both pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic interventions, can be used in place of medications that are considered potentially inappropriate by the AGS Beers Criteria®. ○ This Alternatives list also includes clinician-facing and patient-and caregiver-facing resources to support the implementation of recommended treatment strategies in clinical practice.</p><p>• Why does this paper matter? ○ The Alternatives list is a companion to the AGS Beers Criteria®, which identifies medications whose potential for harm outweighs their intended benefit in older adults. ○ It addresses the need for guidance not only on what therapies to avoid but also on readily available alternative treatment strategies to use in their place. ○ This report presents recommended alternatives in a manner intended to be easily usable by front-line clinicians facing common clinical scenarios.</p><p>for selecting these guidance documents were based on a holistic synthesis of relevance to older adults, credibility and recognition of the source in the field, recency of publication, scientific rigor, thoroughness, and minimizing conflicts of interest. When multiple relevant guidelines met the above criteria, preference was given to guidelines from US organizations (although non-US guidelines were prioritized if they provided better information, e.g., substantively more recent, higher quality of evidence, and/or more relevant to older adults). In most cases, the aim was to have three to four guidance documents per content area selected for final review.</p><p>Workgroup members then reviewed the relevant documents for their area, with the goal of drafting a list of alternatives based on these documents and identifying useful resources for patients, caregivers, and clinicians based on their own practice and conversations with other experts, colleagues, and internet searches. Each workgroup worked with the panel cochairs to finalize a draft list of alternatives and resources for their assigned section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">| Panel Review, Comments, and Finalization</head><p>Draft alternative lists from each workgroup were circulated to the full panel in advance of a full panel video conference focused on initial review of these lists. During this meeting, each workgroup briefly summarized the evidence on their topic and their draft list of alternatives and resources. The panel then had an opportunity to discuss and ask questions. A preliminary vote was taken by voice on each set of alternatives to help determine if there was strong consensus for being acceptable as is or with minor edits.</p><p>Following the full panel call, workgroups continued to work on their sections based on comments and feedback provided. These edited alternatives and resources were then sent to the full panel for review before a second full panel video conference, with additional edits made thereafter as needed. The final version of the alternatives list was reviewed and approved by the full panel via email.</p><p>This initial draft was shared with members of the AGS Beers Criteria® Expert Panel, the AGS Executive Committee, the AGS Clinical Practice and Models of Care committee, and representatives from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and the Pharmacy Quality Alliance (PQA) for comment. Final edits were made based on this feedback, including discussion with relevant workgroups as needed. The final approved lists were sent to the AGS Executive Committee for final review and approval in March of 2025.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">| General</head><p>The panel selected 30 of the 36 criteria from Two criteria were eventually dropped pertaining to desiccated thyroid and androgens because it was determined that alternatives (levothyroxine) or indications for use (confirmed hypogonadism) are understood by clinicians. In total, alternative treatments were included for 21 conditions for which the medications, medication classes, and medication types listed in these 30 criteria are commonly used. While some conditions on this list are discrete diseases, many are symptoms or syndromes (e.g., insomnia, pruritus) that have a range of etiologies. In selected cases, we provide information on whether a medication in the alternatives list is FDA-approved for the management of specific conditions, but we do not provide such information universally across the range of medications and conditions discussed. Of special note, some of the medications identified as alternatives in this report are listed for purposes or in dosages not specified in the manufacturers' product labels, with recommendations based on practice guidelines and best practice guidance.</p><p>Alternative therapies and resources are shown in Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref> Alternative therapies and associated resources are shown in Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref><ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref><ref type="table" target="#tab_11">3</ref><ref type="table" target="#tab_15">4</ref><ref type="table" target="#tab_16">5</ref>. We also note that for many conditions there are helpful patient-and clinician-facing resources to support safe and effective deprescribing of problematic medications, which are too numerous to list adjacent to each condition. Descriptions of some of these supplemental resources are found in Supporting Information 1. They include informational and motivational brochures that target deprescribing for a number of medications, clinician-facing algorithms that provide clear guidance on how to deprescribe many of these medications, and more. Finally, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1</ref> summarizes five key principles to use when applying the recommendations in this document.</p><p>Below we highlight some issues regarding alternative therapies that may be of greatest interest to clinicians.</p></div>

For management of generalized anxiety disorder, buspirone and pregabalin can be used as monotherapy or as an augmentation agent.</p><p>c Gabapentinoids (gabapentin, pregabalin) should not be used concurrently with opioids due to an increased risk of severe adverse events, as noted in the AGS Beers Criteria®. e Brexpiprazole is the only atypical antipsychotic that is FDA-approved for agitation associated with Alzheimer's dementia, and pimavanserin is the only atypical antipsychotic that is FDA-approved for psychosis associated with Parkinson's disease. However, like other antipsychotics, these medications carry a boxed warning for increased mortality risk in older adults with dementia. Therefore, all antipsychotic medications should be limited to situations where the patient is at risk of harming themselves or others, used at the lowest possible dose for the least amount of time, and should be combined with non-pharmacological strategies.  -Foods that are soft, small, and easy to chew into small pieces before swallowing (small particle diet)</p><p>-Frequent small meals -Avoid fatty, spicy, acidic, and high fiber meals -Add soups or liquid-containing meals to diet -Follow tips on preparation of fruits and vegetables to minimize discomfort (see Resources column)</p><p>Consider treatments for symptomatic relief of gastroparesis symptoms, i.e., ginger 1 mg twice daily or ondansetron for nausea.

For symptoms due to overactive bladder: consider β-3 agonists over antimuscarinic agents due their safer adverse event profile in older adults. For women, also consider vaginal estrogen.</p><p>For men with BPH-associated lower urinary tract symptoms: consider uroselective alpha-1 blockers, 5-alpha reductase inhibitors. note, pruritus has several causes that do not respond to antihistamines. When a systemic antihistamine is indicated, a secondor third-generation agent is recommended.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">| Pain</head><p>The many types and causes of pain, including inflammation and neuropathy, influence treatment choice. Thus, identifying the underlying cause of pain and comorbid conditions (e.g., falls) is critical when selecting a pain management regimen, including non-pharmacologic treatments. Several resources are provided to help patients and clinicians understand the role and value of non-pharmacologic options, with an emphasis that improving function should be a key target of therapy. When pharmacologic treatment is needed, it should be tailored to the type of pain. Options can include topical agents such as capsaicin, rubefacients (e.g., menthol and salicylate ointments), lidocaine, and topical NSAIDs, which in many cases have more favorable adverse event profiles than systemic agents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">| Diabetes</head><p>Advances in pharmacotherapy for diabetes care have limited the role of sulfonylureas (including both short-and long-acting varieties) given their potential risk for hypoglycemia. Medication alternatives to sulfonylureas include metformin, SGLT2 inhibitors (especially for patients with heart failure, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, or chronic kidney disease), GLP1 receptor agonists (especially for patients with obesity, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, or chronic kidney disease), DPP-4 inhibitors, and other options. Better yet, the need for medications may be reduced through diet and exercise, and relaxed targets for glycemic control may often be appropriate, especially in older adults with extensive comorbid burden, functional impairments, and/or cognitive decline.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">| Insomnia</head><p>Insomnia and sleep disorders are common problems reported by older adults. Rather than using a benzodiazepine or a nonbenzodiazepine benzodiazepine receptor agonist hypnotic (i.e., "Z-drugs") or a sedating agent with anticholinergic properties (e.g., first-generation antihistamines), underlying causes of and contributors to these conditions should be identified and removed or minimized. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is recommended as the initial treatment for chronic insomnia. Resources are listed for patients and families on sleep hygiene and understanding and accessing CBT-I, including virtual and self-directed programs. For clinicians,  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6">| Delirium</head><p>No pharmacologic treatment is recommended as a routine response to delirium in all populations, and antipsychotics should be avoided in most older adults unless the patient presents a danger to themselves or others and symptoms cannot be managed with non-pharmacologic interventions. First-line options for delirium prevention and management include multicomponent non-pharmacologic interventions such as the AGS CoCare: HELP Program, complemented by approaches to better manage and understand behavior as a form of communication.

If not introduced already, review and initiation of non-pharmacologic interventions such as making dietary changes and elevating the head of the bed are recommended. Deprescribing protocols for PPIs are a valuable resource for patients and clinicians to aid in dose reduction and eventual discontinuation. Histamine-2 receptor blockers may be helpful alternatives for relief of nocturnal symptoms, and acid-protective therapies containing alginic acid (also known as alginate) can be useful for breakthrough symptoms, although with attention to avoiding ingestion of a variety of other medications within 2 hours before or after alginate use due to impacts on drug absorption.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">| Discussion</head><p>Recognizing the demand for an updated list of alternate treatment strategies that can be used in place of medications identified as potentially inappropriate in the 2023 AGS Beers Criteria®, the AGS supported an interdisciplinary, interprofessional panel of 19 generalists and specialists to identify alternatives to these medications. Unlike the earlier list of alternatives <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[2]</ref> aligned with quality measures used by CMS, the current list examines alternatives to the 2023 AGS Beers Criteria® medications and focuses on medications chosen by the panel on the basis of clinical relevance and opportunities to improve care. Other changes from the earlier version include the use of an interdisciplinary expert panel with a formal review process, an emphasis on including both non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic alternatives, and inclusion of useful resources for clinicians, patients, and caregivers.</p><p>While providing alternative therapies for common conditions in older adults may seem to be a straightforward process, a number of challenges are worth noting. Potentially inappropriate medications may often be prescribed on the basis of symptoms rather than diagnoses, such as when a medication is used to treat the symptoms of insomnia, anxiety, rhinorrhea, or pain without having a confirmed diagnosis of the underlying disease process <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">4]</ref>. For this reason, a number of alternative therapies in this list are organized by symptom rather than by diagnosis. Yet, clinical practice guidelines and related documents are typically organized by diagnosis, which can create challenges in transposing their guidance in a manner that reflects the realities and diagnostic uncertainties of busy clinical practice. Moreover, such guidelines often provide relatively little information on how to address the complex needs of older adults, and often there is limited evidence specific to older adults that can be used to guide recommendations <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">6]</ref>.</p><p>In light of these challenges, the panel aimed to take a commonsense approach that was guided by evidence, existing clinical practice guidelines, and other best-practice documents to craft practical, clinically sensible alternatives that are feasible for clinicians to review and use in busy clinical practice environments. As part of this, the panel attempted to highlight when evidence was limited or unavailable, including in clinical scenarios where prescribing practice often diverges from available evidence, such as medication choices for the management of insomnia. When especially important, the alternatives also include reminders for clinicians to seek out and target management to the underlying cause of symptoms-for example, symptoms of rhinorrhea, insomnia, or involuntary weight loss-rather than just treating the symptom without further investigation.</p><p>Moreover, it is important to remember that the solution for stopping a potentially inappropriate medication is not just to start a "better" medication in its place. Thus, when appropriate, the panel emphasized the role of non-pharmacologic strategies to help manage the listed conditions. In addition, stopping a potentially inappropriate medication is not the end goal, especially if doing so may worsen symptoms or result in goal-discordant care.</p><p>It is equally important to find safer non-pharmacologic and/or pharmacologic management strategies that help the patient feel better while reducing the risk of medication-associated harms.</p><p>Users of this list should keep several things in mind. The list is intended as brief, practical guidance that is most applicable to ambulatory care settings (although not exclusively so). It is not comprehensive; it should not substitute for clinical judgment or for individualized, patient-centered care; and it is intended to complement rather than replace other forms of clinical support such as clinical practice guidelines or best-practice monographs. Alternatives for each condition were based on a review of a limited number of guidelines or other best practice documents, further informed by the expertise of the panelists, and the panelists did not review primary research literature or all available guidelines.</p><p>Additional considerations also merit attention. With limited exceptions, the list does not denote which medications are approved by the FDA for which conditions. Readers considering the use of agents not subject to FDA oversight (e.g., dietary supplements, nutraceuticals, herbal products) should remember that the contents, dose, and purity of these agents cannot be guaranteed. When medications available over-the-counter are recommended, it is important to keep in mind that the dose of the active agent(s) and presence of other medications may vary by product, so attention to product formulation and product-specific instructions is important. Finally, but not least, medications on the AGS Beers Criteria® are potentially inappropriate for most older adults, not definitely inappropriate for all <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[7]</ref>. Thus, there are older adults for whom AGS Beers Criteria® medications are the best choice given their individual circumstances, and in whom alternative treatment options are not needed.</p><p>Clinical practice is difficult, and clinicians need guidance not only on what not to do, but also on what to do instead. This list of alternative non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic management strategies that can be used instead of AGS Beers Criteria® medications to treat common conditions in older adults is intended to provide clinicians an easy-to-use resource for improving care. It is a starting point, and the panel encourages readers to peruse the resources provided and to review practice guidelines, best-practice monographs, and other guidance in service of developing optimal management plans for the older adults under their care.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Abbreviations: AAFP = American Association of Family Physicians; APTA = American Physical Therapy Association; BSACI = British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology; CNS = central nervous system; DoD = US Department of Defense; DPP4 = dipeptidyl peptidase-4; GLP1 = glucagon-like peptide 1; NCOA = National Council on Aging; NSAID = non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug; SGLT2 = sodium glucose co-transporter-2; SNRI = serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor; TCA = tricyclic antidepressant; VA = US Department of Veterans Affairs.a Second and third generation oral antihistamines are less sedating and have fewer anticholinergic effects than first generation antihistamines.

While melatonin is an option for patients requesting a natural remedy, evidence of meaningful benefit is limited for most causes of insomnia in older adults, and the contents, purity, and dose of available formulations cannot be guaranteed due to the absence of FDA oversight of supplements.</figDesc><table /></figure>
