<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Caregiving in the US 2025 presents a comprehensive picture of the growing and evolving landscape of family caregiving. In 2025, 63 million American adults provided ongoing care to adults or children with a medical condition or disability-representing almost one-quarter of all adults in the United States. This is a dramatic increase of 45 percent since Caregiving in the US was fielded in 2015. Of these 63 million caregivers, 59 million care for an adult with a complex medical condition or disablity.</p><p>Family caregivers include parents, friends, neighbors, and even children, and they span across all ages, races and ethnicities, incomes, and communities. They assist care recipients with basic mobility, personal care, financial management, complex medical tasks, and more. This report describes the critical role family caregivers play in supporting the nation's fractured long-term services and supports system and highlights how policies and practices support this essential work and where gaps persist.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Caregiving in the US 2025: a national portrait</head><p>Family caregiving forms the invisible backbone of American communities, providing a critical foundation that sustains our nation's health care system and economy. This vast enterprise spans generations and touches every corner of society. More than 63 million adults provide ongoing care for aging parents, spouses with chronic conditions, or adult children with disabilities and serious illnesses-a staggering 45 percent increase since 2015. Among them, approximately 16 million sandwich generation caregivers balance care for both adults and children simultaneously.</p><p>The faces of caregiving are as diverse as America itself. Middle schoolers juggle homework while helping a parent through cancer treatment. Working adults manage careers while caring for aging parents and raising their own children. Retirees dedicate their golden years to supporting adult children with disabilities. College students attend school while helping a parent through cancer treatment. Meanwhile, an estimated 91 million Americans care for children under 18 in their households-these are parents, grandparents, and guardians who often shoulder multiple care responsibilities at once (US Census Bureau 2023b).</p><p>Together, this invisible workforce keeps our families strong and our communities functioning, representing an intergenerational network of support that spans the entire spectrum of the human experience. This report focuses on a critical segment of that spectrum: family caregivers of older adults, people with serious illness, and people with disabilities.</p><p>The National Alliance for Caregiving (NAC) and AARP are proud to present Caregiving in the US 2025, based on comprehensive data collected in 2024. This research continues our longstanding commitment to understanding the evolving landscape of family caregiving that began with our first national profile in 1997 and continued through subsequent editions in <ref type="bibr">2004, 2009, 2015, and 2020</ref>. By iterating and expanding on our established methodology, we can now examine changes in the caregiving experience over the past 15 years.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>This research continues our longstanding commitment to understanding the evolving landscape of family caregiving.</head><p>Our research explores multiple dimensions of caregiving, including the prevalence of Americans providing complex care, their demographic characteristics, the nature and intensity of care provided, health and financial impacts on caregivers, workplace challenges and supports, information needs, and the role of technology in caregiving. We pay particular attention to how economic shifts and evolving health trends have reshaped caregiving responsibilities and resources available to families.</p><p>This research arrives at an inflection point for care in our nation. Policymakers, employers, and health care leaders are grappling with our nation's growing demand for care and the impacts of that care across society. Americans today face complex decisions-balancing the pressures of family responsibilities and career with the reality of longer-living parents and increasing rates of chronic conditions and disabilities. These trends highlight the need to reconsider cultural attitudes, social obligations, financial impact, and the traditional distribution of caregiving responsibilities.</p><p>Caregiving in the US 2025 is a report of empirical survey results that provide a comprehensive description of family caregivers. These findings are a springboard for action for policymakers, advocates, and families-all who develop systems to support and sustain the vital contributions of family caregivers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>What's new for 2025</head><p>In 2025, the survey was improved using validated measures of caregiver physical and emotional health and a revised index of caregiving complexity. Unlike in prior years, the 2025 survey includes paid family caregivers, an important addition. For the first time, the survey is designed to generate state-representative caregiver samples for many states.</p><p>In recognition of the expansion of programs allowing family caregivers to be compensated for some of their care via Medicaid home and community-based service (HCBS) selfdirection waivers, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and other state programs, this year's Caregiving in the US survey includes paid family caregivers. The questionnaire includes a validated measure of caregivers' health, the CDC Healthy Days measure, that was not previously included in Caregiving in the US. The Healthy Days measure, established in 1993, is a fourquestion summary measure of global health-related quality of life. The measure assesses perceived physical and mental health over time and is useful for identifying trends in health and well-being among populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">(Moriarty et al. 2003)</ref>.</p><p>In addition to the Level of Care Index, which is a measure of the intensity or complexity of the caregiving situation that was computed for each administration of Caregiving in the US starting in 1997, the 2025 administration of Caregiving in the US includes an expanded Level of Care Index. The expanded Level of Care Index includes subjective measures aimed at capturing more of the caregiver experience.</p><p>For the first time, the 2025 administration of the survey includes state-representative samples of caregivers. This expansion allows us to estimate the prevalence of caregiving and to describe the characteristics of family caregivers at the state level. State-level results of this survey will be summarized in a separate report to be published in November 2025.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>For the first time, the 2025 administration of the survey includes state-representative samples of family caregivers.</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reading this report</head><p>This report draws from a nationally representative online survey completed by 6,858 family caregivers ages 18 and older. This study defines family caregivers as adults providing ongoing care over the past year to adults or children with complex medical conditions or disabilities. In addition, family caregivers have a pre-existing relationship with the care recipient they support, such as a family member (e.g., spouse, parent), friend, or neighbor.</p><p>Most family caregivers are not paid for the care they provide. In this study, these are unpaid family caregivers. In limited circumstances, certain Medicaid self-direction or VA caregiver programs provide payments to family caregivers. We consider those receiving payment to be paid family caregivers. Paid family caregivers are not equivalent to professional direct care workers though they may perform similar care tasks.</p><p>Throughout this report, arrows or carets in tables indicate statistically significant differences at the 95 percent confidence level. When comparing more than two groups, superscripts show which specific comparisons are statistically significant. All results-including averages, medians, and percentages-have been weighted for accuracy. For complete details about our sampling methodology, survey design, analysis, and weighting, see appendix B.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Detailed findings</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Prevalence of caregiving</head><p>Today, 63 million adults, or almost one-quarter of all American adults, are family caregivers who have provided care to adults or children with a medical condition or disability at some time in the past 12 months. 1 Family caregivers provide support with daily activities like shopping, transportation, and meal preparation; they assist with personal care tasks like bathing and dressing; they help with medical and nursing tasks by giving medications or injections or dressing wounds; and they serve as care coordinators who arrange appointments, monitor the care recipient's condition, and communicate and advocate with care professionals and service providers. Family caregivers are an integral part of the care recipient's care team.</p><p>As table <ref type="table">1</ref> shows, the number of family caregivers in the US continues to increase.</p><p>Table 1. Estimated Number of Family Caregivers and Prevalence of Family Caregiving by Age of Care Recipient, Trend 2015-2025 Types of Care Recipients 2015 2020 2025 Total Family Caregivers (of adults or children with medical conditions or disabilities) 43.5 million (prevalance: 18.2%) 53.0 million (prevalence: 21.3%h) 63.0 million (prevalence: 24.0%h) Family Caregivers of Adults Age 18+ 39.8 million (prevalence: 16.6%) 47.9 million (prevalence: 19.2%h) 59.0 million <ref type="bibr">(prevalence: 22.5%h)</ref> hi Significantly higher or lower than prior wave.</p><p>To see detailed prevalence statistics by demographics and for more information about the prevalence increase, see appendix B.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1</head><p>Of the 21,141 people screened in the online survey, the proportion of initial respondents who had served as caregivers (paid or unpaid) to an adult or child was 24.0 percent. Using a 2024 estimate of 262,083,034 Americans ages 18 and older, the study estimates 63.0 million adults were caregivers to an adult or child in the 12 months prior to the study.</p><p>A family caregiver can be anyone, and each caregiving story is unique. The increase in prevalence of caregiving mirrors the face of caregivers. The number of caregivers has increased among all education levels, work statuses, genders, generations, and income levels and nearly all races and ethnicities. A confluence of factors may influence the increase in the prevalence of caregiving in the US, including the aging of the population, a lack of affordable paid long-term services and supports (LTSS), and an increase in the provision of HCBS that enable older adults to age where they overwhelmingly want to: at home (US Census Bureau 2023a; <ref type="bibr">Reinhard et al. 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Binette and Farago 2024)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Prevalence of paid family caregiving</head><p>For the first time, the 2025 survey includes family caregivers who receive payment for care they provide to an adult family member or friend under Medicaid HCBS self-direction waivers, Veterans Affairs, or other state programs. These family caregivers are distinct from paid professionals, such as home health aides or other direct care workers. This update to the survey screening criteria reflects the shifting policy landscape of caregiving. Several policies have been introduced over the past decade and have accelerated in recent years, allowing family caregivers to receive payment for some of the care they provide. Access to these programs temporarily increased under the COVID-19 public health emergency when the federal government and states developed new flexibilities and mechanisms to support families navigating the pandemic. Although not all states provide the same opportunities for caregivers to receive payment via Medicaid HCBS, most states offer some avenues to payment. See Medicaid LTSS Programs That Pay Family Caregivers for more details on selfdirection policies allowing family caregivers to be paid.</p><p>In total, 11.2 million family caregivers report they were paid for care in 2025. Most of these 11.2 million caregivers indicate they provided both unpaid care and paid care, suggesting that they were paid for only part of the care hours they provided. Only 1.9 million of 59 million caregivers are solely paid family caregivers. For this year, the Caregiving in the US total caregiver prevalence includes both paid, as described earlier, and unpaid family caregivers because the share of solely paid family caregivers is relatively small, does not represent a significant change in the prevalence trend for unpaid family caregiving, and is not performing tasks that differ completely from those of unpaid family caregivers.</p><p>Table 2. Estimated Number and Prevalence of Family Caregivers of Adults by Paid and Unpaid Status, 2025 Caregivers of Adults Ages 18+ Unpaid Family Caregivers Only 47.8 million (18.2%) Paid Family Caregivers Only 1.9 million (0.70%) Family Caregivers Who Are Both Paid and Unpaid 9.3 million (3.60%) Total Family Caregivers of Adults Ages 18+ 59.0 million (22.5%)</p><p>Throughout this report, we include analysis of key differences between unpaid family caregivers and paid family caregivers. Note that these analyses compare family caregivers providing solely unpaid care to family caregivers who provide any paid care (those providing solely paid care and those who provide a mix of paid and unpaid care to a family member or friend). These crosssectional data cannot be used to draw conclusions about the impact of programs that pay family caregivers on those caregivers, but they provide insights into who is incentivized to pursue programs that pay for care.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Medicaid LTSS programs that pay family caregivers</head><p>Medicaid plays a critical role in supporting family caregivers through self-directed long-term services and supports (LTSS) programs that allow them to be paid for their care. As of 2024, 47 states and Washington, DC,* allow payment to family caregivers for personal care services under various LTSS programs <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Burns et al. 2025</ref>). These services typically include assistance with ADLs, such as bathing, dressing, and eating, and some IADLs, like meal preparation and medication management.</p><p>Payments to family caregivers are often authorized through self-directed care models, which are implemented via various Medicaid waivers-such as 1915(c) and 1115-or state plan options. These models allow care recipients to select, train, and manage workers-including friends and family members under some programs-offering both autonomy and flexibility in care delivery. Caregiverinclusive self-direction programs are allowed for certain groups of LTSS beneficiaries and are most widely available for individuals with intellectual or developmental disabilities (IDD), followed by older adults and people with physical disabilities (National Alliance for Caregiving 2025). Legal requirements for participation as a caregiver differ across programs and are complicated.</p><p>The use of self-directed services markedly increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to workforce shortages and safety concerns, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) granted states greater flexibility under self-direction waivers, allowing more family caregivers to be paid via these waivers. This allowed more families to safely meet care needs in home and community settings, and many of these flexibilities have remained in place after the pandemic <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Burns et al. 2025;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Murray et al. 2024)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Protections for the care recipient and family caregiver</head><p>Although most states allow payments to family caregivers, 46 states allow legally responsible relatives, such as spouses or parents of minor children, to become paid care workers <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Burns et al. 2025)</ref>. Payments to legally responsible relatives are subject to stricter federal and state regulations to protect the interests of the beneficiary. For example, a legally responsible relative cannot serve as a representative of the beneficiary and self-direct their care while also hiring themselves. Other states have sought to protect paid family caregivers from burnout by implementing recommended limits on the hours of compensated care or offering respite services.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Compensation models</head><p>Family caregivers are generally paid hourly wages comparable to those of other direct care workers. Thirteen states,** however, have adopted structured family caregiving programs that offer family caregivers a daily stipend instead. These programs typically involve oversight of family caregivers by provider agencies, which offer training, care coordination, and support. Data on payments in all structured family caregiving programs are not available; however, payments to caregivers in those programs that have shared data range from $40 to $50 per day, depending on the state and program structure (American Council on Aging 2025).</p><p>• • Six in 10 caregivers are non-Hispanic white (61 percent), 16 percent are Latino/Hispanic, 13 percent are non-Hispanic African American/Black, 6 percent are Asian American/Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (AANHPI), and 6 percent are some other race or ethnicity.</p><p>• • One in five family caregivers live in rural areas (20 percent).</p><p>For the full demographic profile of family caregivers, see appendix C: Demographic Profile and Prevalence.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Who are paid family caregivers?</head><p>Paid family caregivers tend to be younger than unpaid caregivers (see table <ref type="table">3</ref>). Paid family caregivers tend to be ages 18 to 44 years (52 percent vs. 34 percent of unpaid caregivers) and less often ages 65 and older (14 percent vs. 24 percent of unpaid caregivers). Many of the other demographic differences observed among paid family caregivers tend to correlate with younger ages. Paid family caregivers are more often Hispanic/Latino, Black/African American, or AANHPI and less often have a four-year college degree or have health insurance, compared with unpaid caregivers.</p><p>3 Table 3. Demographic Comparison of Paid Family Caregivers and Unpaid Family Caregivers of Adults Paid Family Caregivers (n = 1,498) Unpaid Family Caregivers (n = 5,051) Age (mean) 45.4i 51.9 Sandwich Generation Family Caregivers (have children) 36%h 27% Students 19%h 7% Race/Ethnicity Non-Hispanic white 44%i 65% Hispanic/Latino 23%h 15% Black/African American 21%h 11% Asian American/Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander 6%h 4%</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3</head><p>For a full comparison of paid family caregivers and unpaid family caregivers, see appendix C: Demographic Profile and Prevalence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Number of care recipients</head><p>The data reveal that although most family caregivers (76 percent) provide care for one person, nearly one-quarter (24 percent) manage care for multiple individuals-with 20 percent caring for two people and 4 percent caring for three or more. This substantial proportion of multiplerecipient caregivers, coupled with the rising prevalence of caregiving overall, reflects a growing culture of Americans who provide critical care support to family members, friends, and neighbors with health or functional needs.</p><p>Demographic analysis shows notable patterns: AANHPI caregivers stand out as most likely to care for multiple recipients (31 percent). In comparison, white caregivers (77 percent), African American/Black caregivers (71 percent), those age 65 or older (86 percent), and those caring for spouses or partners (88 percent) typically focus on a single care recipient. These patterns suggest important cultural and situational factors influencing caregiving responsibilities across different populations.</p><p>Although some caregivers support multiple adults, respondents were asked to describe the characteristics of the primary adult recipient of care. Findings in this report pertain exclusively to the caregiver's main recipient of care.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Care recipient relationship to caregiver</head><p>For most family caregivers, their main care recipient is a relative (89 percent), whereas 11 percent care for a friend, neighbor, or other nonrelative. Most are caring for a parent (40 percent) or parentin-law <ref type="bibr">(7 percent)</ref> or for a spouse or partner (15 percent; see figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</p><p>89% 47% 15% 8% 4% 6% 6% 11% Relative Parent/Parent-in-law Spouse/Partner Grandparent/Grandparent-in-law Sibling/Sibling-in-law Adult child Other relative Non-relative Q7.

Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">20</ref> shows the comparison of how family caregivers are distributed across each level of intensity across the two indices.</p></div>

For the 2020 cycle, the name was adjusted to Level of Care Index, with each level referred to with the word "intensity," as this index is one way to measure the intensity or complexity of the caregiving situation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Medical and nursing tasks</head><p>In addition to ADLs and IADLs, many caregivers take on medical and nursing tasks that are typically handled by health care professionals. These tasks-like administering injections and managing catheters-are performed by 55 percent of caregivers (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_29">30</ref>), yet only 22 percent receive training, most commonly from medical professionals and personal relationships. Female caregivers more often assist with medical and nursing tasks (58 percent compared with 51 percent of male caregivers). African American/Black family caregivers more often report helping with medical and nursing tasks (62 percent) and are more often trained to do these complex care tasks (27 percent) than all other caregivers.</p><p>Nearly one in five caregivers say doing these medical and nursing tasks is difficult (22 percent).</p><p>A greater share of AANHPI caregivers say doing medical tasks for their care recipient is difficult (27 percent). Lower-income caregivers-those with household incomes of less than $50,000-help with medical and nursing tasks more often (59 percent) and more often report that those tasks were difficult (25 percent) compared with higher-income caregivers.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interactions with health care providers</head><p>Caregivers are also key players in managing health care: 70 percent monitor care recipients' health conditions, 64 percent communicate with care recipients' providers, and 58 percent advocate for their care recipients' needs with providers, community services, or government agencies (see figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_43">23</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 23.

Those ages 18 to 49 are least likely to communicate with providers (57 percent vs. 70 percent of caregivers ages 50 or older) or to advocate on their recipient's behalf (52 percent vs. 63 percent of caregivers ages 50 or older). This is consistent with research that shows younger family caregivers ages 18 to 34 have more difficulty getting in touch with health care providers and are slightly less satisfied with their interactions with health care providers <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">(Raimondi 2024</ref>).</p><p>Among family caregivers whose care recipient has been in the hospital overnight in the past year, 70 percent said they were included in discussions about their recipient's care.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Use of technology to help with tasks</head><p>As the nature and complexity of caregiving evolve, family caregivers are increasingly turning to technology solutions to help manage evolving care demands. Thirty-nine percent of caregivers use digital tools to manage care recipients' finances. Even more striking is the rapid adoption of remote monitoring technologies such as apps, video platforms, wearables, and other monitoring systems. This usage has nearly doubled since 2020, with a quarter of caregivers now using these tools to check on care recipients from a distance (25 percent, up from 13 percent in 2020; see figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_43">25</ref>). Four in 10 family caregivers now report using technology or software to track their recipient's personal health records (41 percent, up from 30 percent in 2020), a figure that is higher among female caregivers (43 percent) compared with male caregivers <ref type="bibr">(38 percent)</ref>.</p><p>This technological integration extends to other aspects of caregiving as well. One in five caregivers use assistive devices to support their recipient's independence (20 percent), whereas a similar proportion uses electronic task lists and schedules for care management (19 percent). Younger caregivers, compared with caregivers over 50, more readily embrace technology solutions like remote monitoring (30 percent vs. 22 percent) and digital organizational tools like electronic lists or spreadsheets (22 percent vs. 17 percent).</p><p>Among all caregivers, increasing use of technology suggests a shift in caregiving practices, possibly accelerated by the pandemic, the expanding marketplace of digital caregiving solutions, and the aging of digital natives.

Working while caregiving</head><p>Key Takeaways 9 Seventy percent of working-age caregivers are employed while also providing care. 9 Balancing paid work and care can be a challenge; half of working family caregivers report going in late, leaving early, or taking time off from work to provide care. 9 Working caregivers more often report feeling alone and facing financial difficulty than nonworking caregivers. 9 Caregivers' access to benefits that might help them balance their responsibilities at work and home is increasing, but access to workplace benefits is higher among salaried workers.</p><p>Navigating the dual responsibilities of paid employment and caregiving presents significant challenges for millions of Americans. The intersection of these two demanding roles often requires careful balancing of time, energy, and resources, with implications for both caregivers' economic security and their ability to provide quality care.</p><p>This section offers insight into how caregivers manage employment alongside their caregiving duties and the workplace supports available to them.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Access to caregiver-friendly benefits</head><p>Both the public and private sectors recognize the needs of family caregivers. Support for employed family caregivers has evolved significantly in recent years, with 13 states and the District of Columbia offering paid family leave programs. The COVID-19 pandemic (which occurred after data collection for the 2020 study and became endemic before the 2025 data collection period) also spurred employers to offer flexible work hours and teleworking or remote work, benefits most caregivers report as being helpful to them <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">(Pabilonia and Redmond 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Cobbe et al. 2024)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 28. Workplace Benefits for Caregivers</head><p>However, access to these benefits is not distributed equally to all workers. A greater share of salaried, working family caregivers has access to all six caregiver-friendly workplace benefits measured in this study than hourly earning caregivers. The starkest differences in access are for telecommuting options (58 percent salaried compared with 23 percent hourly); paid family leave (60 percent salaried compared with 35 percent hourly); paid sick leave (78 percent salaried compared with 55 percent hourly); and information, referrals, counseling, or an employee assistance program (43 percent salaried compared with 27 percent hourly).</p><p>Caregivers may not feel comfortable telling their workplace about their caregiving role, which could be a barrier to accessing benefits. Among employed caregivers who are not self-employed, about half report that their supervisor at work is aware of their caregiving responsibility (49 percent). Rural caregivers more often say their supervisor is aware of their caregiving responsibilities (56 percent compared with 49 percent of urban caregivers and 47 percent of suburban caregivers).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Work impacts as a result of caregiving</head><p>Although caregiver-friendly workplace benefits are more common, they do not fully meet the needs of family caregivers, as many working caregivers report work impacts. Going in late, leaving early, or taking time off to provide care is the most common work impact, reported by nearly 5 in 10 caregivers (see figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_27">29</ref>).  More working family caregivers report feeling alone (25 percent) compared with their nonworking counterparts (21 percent), and they experience a variety of financial impacts as a result of caregiving compared with nonworking family caregivers. They report taking on more debt (22 percent compared with 17 percent), using up short-term savings (31 percent compared with 20 percent), leaving bills unpaid or paying them late (19 percent compared with 17 percent), using up long-term savings (17 percent compared with 13 percent), and moving to a less expensive home (9 percent compared with 6 percent). Among working family caregivers, just 10 percent report feeling that their responsibilities as a caregiver led to them being penalized or discriminated against at work. 9</p><p>9 As of December 2024, seven states have expanded statewide employment antidiscrimination laws to include family or caregiving responsibilities as protected classifications.

This finding remains true in 2025. Over half of family caregivers (56 percent) felt they had no choice in taking on their caregiving role, with profound consequences for their health and outlook. African American/Black family caregivers are the most likely to say they had a choice in becoming a caregiver (52 percent).</p><p>The physical and mental health disparities are quantifiable: Caregivers who felt they had no choice have more poor physical health days (5.8 days on average vs. 4.6 days), nearly twice as many poor mental health days <ref type="bibr">(8 vs. 4.5)</ref>, and more days when health issues disrupted their normal activities <ref type="bibr">(4.6 vs. 3.2)</ref>.</p><p>The psychological impact is equally striking: Only 42 percent of involuntary caregivers find purpose in their role versus 62 percent of those who felt they had a choice.</p><p>Support networks also differ significantly. Caregivers who felt they did not have a choice less often have unpaid help (51 percent vs. 56 percent), and nearly three times more experience feelings of isolation (34 percent vs. 12 percent).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. Policy and program support for family caregivers</head><p>Key Takeaways 9 Caregivers across different income levels show varied preferences for financial support policies-higher-income caregivers favor tax credits (71 percent), whereas lower-income caregivers prioritize direct payment programs (71 percent).</p><p>9 Caregivers value support beyond finances, such as respite services (39 percent), professional assessment of their needs (33 percent), and emotional support (30 percent), alongside practical assistance with care recipient safety (27 percent) and paperwork management (26 percent).</p><p>9 Although 47 percent of caregivers now have plans for their own futures, 38 percent report no comprehensive plans exist for managing their care recipients' affairs.</p><p>Family caregivers provide billions of hours of unpaid care annually while facing substantial personal and financial challenges. As caregiving demands grow with an aging population, targeted policy solutions become more essential. This section examines caregivers' preferences for financial support, programs, and planning tools to inform comprehensive policy development.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Financial support policies</head><p>The economic impact of caregiving extends far beyond immediate out-of-pocket expenses. Many caregivers reduce work hours, pass up promotions, or leave the workforce entirely, resulting in lost wages, reduced retirement savings, and diminished Social Security benefits. These career sacrifices can amount to hundreds of thousands of dollars in lifetime earnings losses. To address these substantial financial challenges, caregivers seek policy solutions that provide meaningful relief.</p><p>Most family caregivers think tax credits, paid leave, and programs that provide pay for caregiving would be financially helpful, consistent with sentiments toward these same policies in 2020. This strong support reflects the significant financial challenge that caregiving places on families across America. According to the data, 69 percent would find an income tax credit helpful, 68 percent consider caregiver payment programs helpful, and 55 percent view partially paid leaves of absence as helpful.  Family caregivers across income levels express different preferences for financial support mechanisms, reflecting their unique economic circumstances. Those with household incomes below $50,000 are more likely to find direct payment programs valuable (71 percent compared with 67 percent of higher-income caregivers). Meanwhile, caregivers earning $50,000 or more tend to prefer income tax credits (71 percent vs. 64 percent of lower-income caregivers). These divergent preferences underscore the importance of developing diverse financial support policies that address the varied needs of family caregivers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Caregiver support and training policies</head><p>Family caregivers express clear preferences regarding supportive programs and services that address their multifaceted needs. The highest demand is for respite services, with 39 percent valuing programs that provide temporary relief and breaks from caregiving. Additionally, one-third of caregivers (33 percent) want policies requiring health care professionals to assess their needs as caregivers to better support their care recipients.</p><p>Caregivers increasingly recognize their own well-being as essential, with 3 in 10 seeking more help or information to manage their emotional or physical stress. Meanwhile, 22 percent would find conversations with health care professionals about addressing their self-care needs beneficial. Practical support remains important as well, with 27 percent of caregivers seeking assistance in keeping care recipients safe at home, whereas 26 percent need help managing paperwork or navigating eligibility requirements for services. These findings highlight the importance of developing comprehensive support systems that recognize caregivers not only as providers of care but as individuals with distinct needs requiring attention and resources to sustain that care.</p><p>Having respite services available, where someone would take/have taken care of your recipient to give you a break Requiring a doctor, nurse, or social worker to ask you about what you need to help care for yourself Requiring a doctor, nurse, or social worker to ask you about what you need to help care for your care recipient 22% 33% 39% N20. Various organizations are thinking about ways to help caregivers like you. Which of the following do you think would be / have been helpful to you? 2025 Base: Caregivers of Recipient Age 18+ (n = 6,549) "They need to make it clear what people are entitled to. After 7 years of paying everything for my mother…this year I was told she could get assistance. I did not know. I bet there are plenty of people like myself out there that have no idea."  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Long-range planning</head><p>The implementation of comprehensive care plans represents a critical component in supporting family caregivers, yet significant gaps remain. Despite their importance for managing financial matters, health care decisions, and living arrangements, 38 percent of caregivers report that no established plans exist, whereas an additional 19 percent are uncertain whether such plans are in place. Encouragingly, progress has been made since 2015, with 47 percent of family caregivers now reporting they have implemented long-range plans for their own futures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>"The hardest part for me is you really do become a tech in a way. You have to do things like the port, and I deal with things like the dosage of the medication, and it wasn't easy." -Nancy, New Jersey Caregiver to her husband, who has a stem cell transplant</head><p>This growing emphasis on future planning could reflect an increasing awareness of the need for structured support systems that address both immediate caregiving responsibilities and long-term personal well-being through clearly defined instructions for financial management, health care choices, and residential considerations. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Over the past decade, family caregiving has become an increasingly prevalent experience. In 2015, 18 percent of all American adults (44 million) were caring for an adult or child with a disability or serious medical condition. By 2025, those numbers had risen to 24 percent of all Americans, or 63 million adults. While there are inherent similarities across caregiving experiences, each situation is also unique.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>"Caring for your aging parents is not something easily prepared for, but it is a relief to know that there are ways doctors can be of more help. The patients must come first, and by educating caregivers by giving us more information on how to continue putting them first, we can work together both meaningfully and more successfully." -Rachel, New York Caregiver to her mother, who has dementia</head><p>Caregivers come from all backgrounds. Although the average caregiver age is 51, just over 40 percent are between ages 18 and 50. Most are caring for a relative facing multiple, complex health conditions that demand a wide range of skills and adaptability on the caregiver's part. Caregivers help with medical and nursing tasks, ADLs, management of their care recipient's finances, coordination of health care and social services, and countless other functions.</p><p>The intensity and duration of caregiving are increasing. Thirty percent of caregivers have been caregiving for five years or more, and more caregivers than ever are assisting with ADLs. More than half of caregivers balance these extensive responsibilities with employment and often face work disruptions because of care demands. Financial strain is common, especially among African American/Black, Hispanic/Latino, lower-income, and younger caregivers. Additionally, caregiving takes a toll on personal health: 20 percent report fair or poor health, and nearly a quarter struggle to care for themselves.</p><p>As caregiving continues to shift in scope, intensity, and complexity-driven by demographic, technological, and health care changes-it is crucial to understand the vital role of caregivers in our health and social systems. Only by recognizing the full picture of caregivers, and the range of roles they perform, can we begin to ensure the support they need.</p><p>are shared.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Questionnaire design</head><p>The 2025 questionnaire is based on the Caregiving in the US 2020 questionnaire. Most of the questions from prior administrations of this survey were maintained to show changes in the caregiver population over time. The 2025 questionnaire is shown in appendix A.</p><p>First, respondents had to agree to participate in this study. They were presented with an informed consent statement before the start of the survey. The informed consent statement outlined information about the study, including sponsorship, benefits to participating, ability to skip or withdraw, confidentiality, and data use. It also provided points of contact for both National Alliance for Caregiving and the Biomedical Research Alliance of New York Institutional Review Board.</p><p>The screener establishes whether a respondent is an unpaid family caregiver for an adult, a paid family caregiver of an adult, a family caregiver of a child under age 18 with disabilities or serious medical conditions, or not a caregiver. The screening questions used to identify the status of a family caregiver are as follows:</p><p>To identify the unpaid family caregiver of an adult:</p><p>At any time in the last 12 months, has anyone in your household provided unpaid care to a relative or friend 18 years or older to help them take care of themselves?</p><p>This may include helping with personal needs or household chores. It might be managing a person's finances, arranging for outside services, or visiting regularly to see how they are doing. This adult does not need to live with you.</p><p>To identify the family caregiver of an adult who receives some form of payment:</p><p>At any time in the last 12 months, has anyone in your household gotten paid to provide care to a relative or friend 18 years or older to help them take care of themselves?</p><p>This may include helping with personal needs or household chores. It might be managing a person's finances, arranging for outside services, or visiting regularly to see how they are doing. This adult need not live with you.</p><p>Hover-over definition for "paid to provide care": Paid care includes payments to caregivers through self-directed programs under Medicaid, Veteran's Affairs, or other state programs. Paid care does not include those employed full-time as direct care workers, such as home health aides or assistants, in a home or community-based settings or facility setting.</p><p>To identify those caring for a child with disabilities or a serious medical condition:</p><p>In the last 12 months, has anyone in your household provided unpaid care to any child under the age of 18 because of a medical, behavioral, or other condition or disability?</p><p>This kind of unpaid care is more than the normal care required for a child of that age. This could include care for an ongoing medical condition, a serious short-term condition, emotional or behavioral problems, or developmental problems.</p><p>If the respondent reported they were not a caregiver but reported that someone else in the household was a caregiver, the survey ended after obtaining the demographic data (if the respondent was part of the opt-in sample and not in the KnowledgePanel®). If the respondent was a family caregiver of an adult or a family caregiver of both an adult and a child, the respondent was administered the questionnaire about their caregiving experience for the adult. If the respondent was a family caregiver of a child only, they were administered the questionnaire about their caregiving experience for the child. Only one family caregiver per household was surveyed.</p><p>Respondents who self-identified as a family caregiver (paid or unpaid) were validated as being a caregiver of an adult if they report providing help with at least one activity of daily living (ADL), instrumental activity of daily living (IADL), or medical or nursing task. Validated caregivers go on to complete the full survey. Caregivers who are not validated are terminated from the survey at the point of response that disqualifies them as a family caregiver. To be validated as a family caregiver of a child only and complete the full survey, all self-identified caregivers of children had to confirm that the child had at least one condition for which they required care or that the child was limited in their ability to do "things most children of the same age do." Nonvalidated family caregivers of children are terminated from the survey at the point of response that disqualifies them as a family caregiver.</p><p>The questionnaire asks for demographic data for all screened respondents regardless of caregiver status such as race, ethnicity, gender, education, state of residence, and age. Ipsos provided the following additional appended variables for KnowledgePanel® respondents: rurality, residence type, employment status, household income, marital status, metropolitan area, and home ownership.</p><p>Ipsos programmed the questionnaire into a computer-aided web interviewing system (CAWI) and administered the survey to their KnowledgePanel® in both English and Spanish. The Spanishlanguage version was professionally translated from English.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Sample</head><p>The Caregiving in the US 2025 survey uses KnowledgePanel®, the largest online panel in the United States that relies on probability-based sampling methods for recruitment to provide a representative sampling frame of adults in the US. This is the same national, probability-based online panel used for previous administrations of the Caregiving in the US survey. Ipsos selects panelists to join KnowledgePanel® via random selection of residential addresses, known as addressbased sampling (ABS). People in selected households are invited by mail 3 to participate in the web-enabled KnowledgePanel®. Ipsos provides a web-enabled device and internet service at no cost to respondents who agree to participate and who do not already have internet access. People who already have devices and internet service participate in the panel using their own equipment.</p><p>Panelists receive notification emails inviting them to complete active surveys and reminder emails at a regular cadence. All panel members are provided with privacy and confidentiality protections. Ipsos also operates an ongoing modest incentive program to encourage participation and create member loyalty. The incentive program includes special raffles and sweepstakes with both cash rewards and other prizes. KnowledgePanel® respondents receive an incentive based on a points structure. Reward points can be redeemed for cash, games, gift cards, or merchandise.</p><p>3 Adults from sampled households are invited to join KnowledgePanel® through a series of mailings, including an initial invitation letter, a reminder postcard, and a subsequent follow-up letter. Moreover, telephone refusal-conversion calls are made to nonresponding households for which a telephone number could be matched to a physical address. Invited households can join by completing and mailing back a paper form in a postage-paid envelope, calling a toll-free hotline maintained by Ipsos, or going to a designated Ipsos website and completing the recruitment form online.</p><p>The target population for the Caregiving in the US 2025 survey includes noninstitutionalized adults ages 18 and older residing in the United States. In addition to the general population sample, KnowledgePanel® recruited supplemental samples of Black/African Americans, Hispanics, Asian Americans (inclusive of Pacific Islanders and Native Hawaiians and referred to as AANHPI), residents of certain states, persons ages 75 and older, and persons ages 18 to 27 to improve inferences about caregivers within those populations. 4   The survey was fielded with 30,231 KnowledgePanel® respondents, 22,338 of whom completed at least the screener. The final sample includes 6,858 completed surveys, 5,106 from KnowledgePanel® and 1,752 opt-in respondents from select states where the KnowledgePanel® sample was small.</p><p>Total KnowledgePanel Sample® <ref type="bibr">(N= 30,231)</ref> Completed Screener <ref type="bibr">(N= 22,338)</ref> Validated as a caregiver and passed quality checks <ref type="bibr">(N= 5,228)</ref> Completed survey (N= 5,106)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interpreting the inclusion of paid family caregivers</head><p>The inclusion of paid family caregivers in the Caregiving in the US sample is new in 2025. Payments to family caregivers include those received from self-directed programs under Medicaid, Veterans Affairs, or other state programs. 5 Paid family caregivers do not include those employed full time as direct care workers, such as home health aides or assistants, in home or community-based settings or in a facility setting.</p><p>The number of paid family caregivers in the United States in 2025 is 11.2 million, most of whom indicated they also provide unpaid care. 6 Because most paid family caregivers in the 2025 study also report being unpaid caregivers 7 and the prevalence of paid-only family caregiving is so low (0.7 percent), we present results for 2025 across the full spectrum of caregivers of adults (paid and unpaid) and compare them to 2020 results (unpaid caregivers of adults). For additional details about the prevalence of paid family caregiving, see the following Prevalence section. For information about who paid family caregivers are, see section B of the main report.</p><p>4 Due to the small sample size of American Indian/Alaska Native respondents, findings cannot be reliably generalized to this population, representing a limitation of this study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5</head><p>As of 2024, 47 states and Washington, DC, allow payment to family caregivers for personal care services under various LTSS programs, according to the KFF Medicaid HCBS Program Survey 2024 <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Burns et al. 2025)</ref>. In that survey, Florida, Indiana, and Utah did not respond to questions assessing which states pay family caregivers under any Medicaid HCBS programs.</p><p>6 Just 0.71 percent of Americans surveyed reported being paid family caregivers only (prevalence of paid-only family caregiving among adults living in the US), or approximately 1.9 million caregivers. The remaining 9.3 million paid family caregivers also reported being an unpaid caregiver to either an adult or a child, suggesting that caregivers view these payment programs as supplemental or cover only part of the care hours provided. 7 Among the family caregivers who identified as receiving payments for some portion of the care they provide, 83 percent said they provide unpaid care to an adult.</p><p>oversampling of those racial/ethnic categories. Benchmarks for targets were obtained from the 2022 American Community Survey. Benchmarks included age by gender, census region, education, household income, language dominance, Hispanic origin, and state.</p><p>The resulting weight was trimmed and scaled to the number of screened respondents and labeled as "KP_screen_wt." This weight was used to generate national caregiver incidence rates and statelevel incidence rates, except in those states that had sufficient sample size to create state-specific screened respondent weights.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>National caregiver weight</head><p>For states with at least 100 KnowledgePanel® caregiver responses, the resulting weights were trimmed and scaled to sum to the number of qualified respondents (n = 5,106) who were caregivers. This weight is labeled as "KP_qualified_wt" and used for all national analyses of caregivers presented in this report.</p><p>For states with fewer than 100 KnowledgePanel® caregiver responses, opt-in sample supplemented the number of caregivers who completed the survey. These states included:</p><p>Alaska, Arkansas, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Maine, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Utah, Vermont, Washington DC, West Virginia, and Wyoming.</p><p>Design weights for opt-in sample caregivers were created by weighting these opt-in respondents to the geodemographic characteristics of the 18-and-older caregiver population within these states as generated using the KP_screen_wt and an additional bias-correction factor of four variables. The targets included age by gender, race/ethnicity, education, household income, language dominance, census region, and the four-variable correction for opt-in based on media and psychographic metrics. The resulting weights for these states was scaled to sum to the number of qualified respondents (n = 1,752) and labeled as "Optin_qualified_wt."</p><p>Finally, the two weights of "KP_qualified_wt" and "Optin_qualified_wt" were combined to create "overall_wt" for the full population of caregivers surveyed (n = 6,858).</p></div>

These steps remain the same as in 2020 and 2015 to maintain consistency in reporting. All cases are weighted using the screened respondent weight for prevalence calculations.</p><p>1. Designate respondents who indicated they are a caregiver in the screener and assist with an ADL, IADL, or medical or nursing task as validated caregivers.</p><p>2. Designate respondents who indicated they are a caregiver in the screener but did not assist with an ADL, IADL, or medical or nursing task, or did not complete enough of the survey to indicate whether they assisted with these tasks as nonvalidated caregivers.</p><p>3. Adjust nonvalidated caregivers as follows: 94.85 percent of respondents who reported being a caregiver in the screener are validated caregivers. Multiply this percentage by nonvalidated caregivers as an adjustment. 4. Add the number of validated caregivers and adjusted nonvalidated caregivers. 5. Divide by the total number of adults age 18+ according to US Census data Prevalence = Validated caregivers + Adjusted nonvalidated caregivers Number of Adults Ages 18+ in the US The prevalence of each type of family caregiver is shown in table B1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Prevalence of paid family caregiving</head><p>The 2025 Caregiving in the US survey also included paid family caregivers. As shown in table B1, 4.27 percent of adults in the US say they are a family caregiver who receives some payment for providing care. Many of the caregivers who indicate they are paid family caregivers respond that they also provide unpaid care to a care recipient. This suggests that for many family caregivers, payment for caregiving does not cover all the hours of care provided. To estimate the number of adults who are exclusively paid family caregivers, we subtract the prevalence of unpaid family caregiving from total caregiving prevalence, shown in table <ref type="table">B2</ref>.</p><p>imputation for 16 cases for which no verbatims were provided) resulted in level of constant care values for all cases. This manual review was new to the 2025 imputation and had a minimal impact on the overall share of caregivers reporting differing levels of constant care. As with the method described previously (using 2020 data), imputed caregiving hour values were dispersed around the mean of each of the four levels of constant care.</p><p>2. Determine the sources of variability in care hours for caregivers not reporting constant care: Four binary measures were the basis for previous imputations. All combinations of these four binary measures result in 16 possible combination categories.</p><p>For those not reporting constant care, hours of care were computed for each combination category. For those who report constant care, the share of caregivers in each of the 16 combination categories is calculated and compared with each of the four levels of constant care defined in follow-up question Q25Z. Imputed hours of care are then calculated as a percentage of the mean hours of caregivers who report care hours, and variation around these new means is determined using the share of caregivers providing constant care who are within the relatively time-intensive (or less time-intensive) of the 16 combination categories.</p><p>The hours spent by caregivers in each of the 16 conditions is expressed, and variation around constant care means can be produced using the share of caregivers providing constant care who are within the relatively time-intensive (or less time-intensive) of the 16 combination categories. This imputation assumes that time-intensive conditions for those reporting numeric caregiving values are also time-intensive conditions and reporting the categorical response of "providing constant care."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Value estimation and adjustments:</head><p>Values for cases reporting constant care were estimated and assigned based on the variability determined for cases with known hours.

Answered yes to 1 question identifying caregivers and to 1 of 3 questions about ADL, IADL, or medical and nursing task-related care provided. At any time in the last 12 months, has anyone in your household provided unpaid care to a relative or friend 18 years or older to help them take care of themselves? This may include helping with personal needs or household chores. It might be managing a person's finances, arranging for outside services, or visiting regularly to see how they are doing. This adult does not need to live with you. AND: At any time in the last 12 months, has anyone in your household gotten paid to provide care to a relative or friend 18 years or older to help them take care of themselves? This may include helping with personal needs or household chores. It might be managing a person's finances, arranging for outside services, or visiting regularly to see how they are doing. This adult need not live with you. 5 years Nationally representative (web) survey of the US population (using KnowledgePanel®) conducted in 2024 12 months National Study of Caregiving (NSOC) The NSOC, conducted as part of the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS), defines a caregiver as someone who provides help to an NHATS respondent (age 65+) with activities such as personal care, mobility, household tasks, transportation, or managing finances and medications. Periodically, caregivers of NHATS participants are interviewed in the supplemental NSOC. Interviews are conducted with family and unpaid helpers to NHATS participants who report receiving assistance with selfcare, mobility, medical or household activities. [From NHATS] Eligible sample persons reported receiving help with mobility activities (getting around inside or outside, getting out of bed), selfcare activities (eating, bathing, using the toilet, dressing), or household activities for health or functioning reasons (laundry, shopping, preparing hot meals, paying bills and banking, keeping track of medications). Helpers of eligible sample persons are eligible for NSOC if: 1) they were either related to the sample person or unrelated and not paid to help, and 2) they helped with mobility activities (getting around inside or outside, getting out of bed), self-care activities (eating, bathing, using the toilet, dressing), household activities for any reasons (laundry, shopping, preparing hot meals, paying bills and banking, keeping track of medications), or other activities (other money matters, medical activities, transportation).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Research design</head><p>The design of this study aims to estimate the prevalence of family caregiving for children and adults with disabilities or serious medical conditions in the US and to describe the characteristics, roles, and needs of family caregivers. For the purposes of this survey, family caregiving is defined as providing ongoing supports and management of complex care tasks for children and adults with chronic, disabling, or serious health conditions.</p><p>All respondents are screened for their age and eligible family caregiver status. This allows estimation of the national prevalence of caregiving for persons of any age (children and/or adults with disabilities or serious medical conditions) among adults in the US. Respondents who indicate they are age 18 or older and provide regular caregiving, in line with the definition above, then respond to the full survey online.</p><p>In previous cycles of this survey, survey respondents had to be unpaid family caregivers. In recognition of the expanded availability of programs allowing family caregivers to receive some form of payment for their care, the Caregiving in the US 2025 survey expanded the eligibility criteria to include family caregivers of adults who were receiving payment for care. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Field methodology</head><p>Ipsos invited one adult per household in a representative sample of households to participate in the Caregiving in the US 2025 study. Selected panel members received an email invitation to complete the survey and were asked to do so at their earliest convenience. All randomly selected respondents began with the screener; only randomly selected respondents who identified as family caregivers proceeded to the substantive portion of the questionnaire.</p><p>The survey was fielded August 6 through October 14, 2024. KnowledgePanel® respondents had the option of conducting the survey in Spanish or English. Five percent of qualified respondents took the survey in Spanish.</p><p>Email reminders were sent to nonresponders on Day 3 of the field period. Additional reminders were sent to any remaining nonresponders on days 7, 10, and 14 of the field period.</p><p>The median completion time of the survey was 21 minutes. See appendix A for full questionnaires in both English and Spanish with all instructions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data quality checks</head><p>Ipsos, NAC, and AARP conducted data quality checks on KnowledgePanel® and the opt-in sample.</p><p>Respondents were unable to complete the survey more than once; after completing the survey one time, respondents no longer had access to the survey.</p><p>Opt-in cases received an additional open-ended question that asked them to describe their caregiving tasks to detect any bots or noncaregivers. This open-ended question was manually checked for quality.</p><p>A total of 183 respondents were removed from the final data. These included 157 cases for not passing Ipsos technical and survey-based quality control checks, such as having an age mismatch of +/-two years between this survey and panel data. Twenty-six were removed by NAC and AARP after quality checks. Reasons for removal of these 26 cases include indicating they were a professional or volunteer caregiver, nonsensical answers in open-ended questions, speeding through the survey, and providing less than one hour of care a week.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Weighting</head><p>Multiple weights were created to aid in analysis for the data. This section provides an overview of the multipart weighting process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>National screened respondent weight</head><p>A total screened respondent weight was created for estimates of incidence of caregiving, which included data from all samples in the study, regardless of caregiver status. This screened respondent weight (n = 21,143) involved two steps:</p><p>1. Design weights for KnowledgePanel® assignees were computed to reflect their selection probabilities. This involved all samples, including the general population sample plus the supplemental samples for Hispanics, non-Hispanic Black/African Americans, non-Hispanic Asians/Native Hawaiians/Pacific Islanders (AANHPI), some state-specific samples, those ages 75 and older, and those ages 18 to 27.</p><p>2. Design weights were adjusted to the geodemographic distribution of the 18-and-over US population by controlling demographics within race/ethnicity (Hispanics, non-Hispanic Black/African Americans, AANHPI, and all else) through nested targets to account for the </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H. Level of Care Index</head><p>Original Level of Care Index</p><p>The Level of Care Index, first developed in the 1997 study Family Caregiving in the US (a predecessor to this research) and used in the <ref type="bibr">2004, 2009, 2015, and 2020</ref> Caregiving in the US studies, 9 is replicated in this study to convey a simple measure of the intensity or complexity of the caregiving situation. This index provides one way to articulate the impact of a disease or disability on the people who care for an individual during the caregiver journey. The index is based on the number of hours of care given and the number of ADLs and IADLs performed.</p><p>For caregivers, the calculation of the Level of Care Index begins by assigning points for the number of hours of care, as follows:  <ref type="bibr">1997, 2004, 2009, and 2015</ref> waves of this study, this index was referred to as the Burden of Care Index, with each level of the index referred to as high, moderate or medium, and low "burden." For the 2020 cycle, the name was changed to Level of Care Index, with each level of the index referred to with the word "intensity," as this index is one way to measure the intensity or complexity of the caregiving situation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Caregiving in the US 2025 117</head><p>Then, the total number of points is consolidated into five levels of care. In this report, analysis often further collapses the five levels into three categories of intensity, with "high intensity" equating to levels 4 to 5, "medium intensity" corresponding to level 3, and "low intensity" equating to levels 1 and 2. Consolidating points into five levels of care and three intensity categories</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Points</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Expanded Level of Care Index</head><p>The Level of Care Index, as described earlier, measures the caregiving experience objectively through two equally weighted components: hours spent caregiving and the numbers of ADLs and IADLs the caregiver performs. The Level of Care Index does not account for the subjective experience of caregiving, an area of growing focus in caregiving research. To address these developments, Caregiving in the US 2025 includes an Expanded Level of Care Index that incorporates subjective measures of the caregiving experience. The expanded index adds two components to the Level of Care Index-a measure of the ease of coordinating care between health care and other service providers and a measure of paid and/or unpaid caregiving help-to capture objective and subjective aspects of the caregiving experience:</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Imputation of hours of care values</head><p>The Caregiving in the US 2025 questionnaire asks how many hours per week one spends on caregiving duties as a numeric value (e.g., 24 hours per week). Caregivers could alternatively select from two categorical values, "less than one hour per week" or "providing constant care," as follows.</p><p>Q25. Thinking now of all the kinds of help you provided for your…, about how many hours did you spend in an average week helping them?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hours [open-end numeric value] Less than 1 hour per week Constant care</head><p>The 2015 and 2020 Caregiving in the US analyses imputed a fixed value for all respondents who reported providing constant care using four predictors: employment while caregiving, co-residence of the care recipient in the caregiver's home, number of ADLs caregiver helps with, number of IADLs caregiver helps with, and the presence of other unpaid caregivers. Constant care responses were validated against a follow-up question asking caregivers who provided constant care to describe their hours of care. The 2015 and 2020 Caregiving in the US analyses imputed 77 hours of care for all caregivers reporting constant care. Benchmarks from the 2020 American Time Use survey and the Guardian Life Insurance study validate the average hours of care imputed in 2015</p><p>Caregiving in the US 2025 119</p><p>and 2020. 10 These benchmarks find that caregivers provide an average of 24 hours of care per week. Other measures in the 2025 Caregiving in the US survey, such as the share of respondents reporting constant care hours and the relationship of the 2020 care hour imputation model measures to each other, demonstrate consistent relationships to those seen in 2020. This indicates that it remains appropriate to use the 2020 benchmarks in 2025 in the absence of more recent benchmarks.</p><p>Q25Z. We would like to understand a little bit more about people like you who have provided constant care. Approximately 7 in 10 respondents reported a numeric caregiving hours value that did not require imputation. Caregivers reporting less than one hour per week of time caregiving were assigned a fixed value of 0.5 hours. To impute values for caregivers reporting constant care, we took the following steps.</p><p>1. Set floor and ceiling values for constant care: First, the few (i.e., .5 percent) caregivers who typed in a numeric value of 98 or more hours of care per week (indicative of constant care) were given an upper-bound value of 98 hours. This approach aims to limit skew and follows what was done in prior years. We expect those reporting constant care to report a high number of caregiving hours. As such, cases with an estimated imputed value of fewer than 41 hours were manually set to a value of 41; however, no cases fell into this category.</p><p>Respondents reporting constant care receive imputed values ranging from a low of 41 hours and a maximum of 168 hours.</p><p>About 7 percent of cases reporting constant care did not report a follow-up level of constant care value (e.g., "providing care all the time, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week") but provided a verbatim description of what constant care entailed. Review of these verbatims (and hot-deck </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Caregiver demographic profile</head><p>Caregivers reflect the general US population and on the whole look similar to caregivers in 2020 (see figure <ref type="figure">C1</ref>). Six in 10 are women and 4 in 10 are men; the average age is 50.6 years, 6 in 10 are white, and about half are married.  Most caregivers have health insurance, usually through an employer. National estimates of insurance coverage indicate that 11.5 percent of Americans ages 18 to 64 do not have health insurance. 13 Among caregivers ages 18 to 64, 13.5 percent report they do not have health insurance, suggesting that caregivers are more likely than general Americans to lack health insurance. Just 8 percent have served in the US armed forces (down from 2020), and 8 percent self-identify as LGBTQ. One in three report their recipient lives in a rural area, and 12 percent say their recipient is a veteran (also down from 2020). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Demographic profile of family caregivers (paid vs. unpaid)</head><p>Paid family caregivers are younger than unpaid family caregivers by 5.5 years, on average. They are more often African American, Hispanic/Latino, Asian American, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander. They are more often living with a partner, single, or separated than unpaid family caregivers and are less often to have a college degree (see figure <ref type="figure">C2</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Prevalence of caregiving by demographics</head><p>The prevalence of caregiving for adults and children with disabilities or serious medical conditions has increased among most demographic groups compared with prevalence estimates from 2020.  </p></div>			</div>
