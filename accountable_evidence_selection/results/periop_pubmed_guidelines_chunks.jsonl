POQI conferences assemble a collaborative group of diverse international experts to develop consensus-based recommendations in perioperative medicine. On June 4\u20136, 2023, the 11th POQI meeting took place in London, UK, to update recommendations in three key areas in perioperative medicine: perioperative arterial pressure management, goal-directed haemodynamic therapy, and fluid therapy. An international panel of experts in perioperative medicine from Europe, North America, and Australia reviewed previously published recommendations and provided updated consensus recommendations based on new literature published in each field. Consensus was achieved using a modified Delphi method, designed to use the collective expertise of a diverse group of experts to answer clinically important questions using published methods. In the pre-meeting phase, we reviewed previous consensus statements and recommendations and searched and reviewed relevant literature published since the previous consensus statements.ClinicalTrials.gov and the Cochrane database and asked experts to nominate additional relevant articles for consideration. During the 11th POQI meeting, the arterial pressure management group (the authors of this article) formulated the main statements and recommendations that were then iteratively reviewed and revised between alternating small group (arterial pressure management group only) and plenary (all panellists of the 11th POQI meeting) sessions with voting to approve (or not) in the final plenary session. The votes on all our final statements and recommendations were unanimous. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) framework was used to categorise the quality of evidence and the strength of recommendations. After the meeting, we prepared and revised the manuscript reporting this process. This article summarises the consensus statements and recommendations of the perioperative arterial pressure management group and is structured considering key aspects of the Appraisal of Guidelines, Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II statement.", "type": "Document"}
{"id": null, "metadata": {"source": "PMC11282474.txt", "chunk_id": 3, "char_count": 7229}, "page_content": "### Consensus statements and recommendations\nConsensus statement 1: Intraoperative mean arterial pressures <60\u201370 mm Hg or systolic arterial pressures <90\u2013100 mm Hg are associated with acute kidney injury, myocardial injury, myocardial infarction, and death. Injury is a function of hypotension severity and duration (high-quality evidence). Consensus recommendation 1: We recommend keeping intraoperative mean arterial pressure \u226560 mm Hg in at-risk patients (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). Intraoperative hypotension remains vaguely defined. Consequently, definitions for intraoperative hypotension vary widely. Recent observational research confirms previous studies,, Baseline arterial pressure varies considerably among individual patients presenting for surgery., The associations between intraoperative hypotension and acute kidney and myocardial injury are clear. However, it remains largely unknown whether the observed associations are causal, and thus amenable to intervention. Only a few randomised trials have reported the effect of targeted arterial pressure management on postoperative outcomes. A single-centre trial of 458 major noncardiac surgery patients with high baseline cardiovascular risk tested the hypothesis that keeping intraoperative mean arterial pressure \u226575 mm Hg compared to \u226560 mm Hg reduces the incidence of a composite primary outcome of acute myocardial injury within the first 3 postoperative days and 30-day acute kidney injury or major adverse cardiovascular events.vs 23 min).P=0.42). The large international POISE-3 trial tested the effects of a hypotension-avoidance vs a hypertension-avoidance strategy on major postoperative vascular complications in 7490 patients with hypertension having noncardiac surgery.P=0.92). These two trials,vs routine arterial pressure management improves a composite of serious perfusion-related complications. Inter-individual variability in preoperative baseline arterial pressureP=0.02). The ongoing IMPROVE-multi trial In summary, there are clear associations between intraoperative hypotension and renal and myocardial injury. However, trial data remain sparse and suffer methodologic limitations. The extent to which the associations are causal thus remains largely unknown; consequently, the acceptable lower limit of intraoperative arterial pressure remains uncertain. Nonetheless, available information suggests that keeping intraoperative mean arterial pressure \u226560 mm Hg is advisable. Consensus recommendation 2: We recommend increasing mean arterial pressure targets when venous or compartment pressures are elevated (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). Mean arterial pressure, the mean pressure over the cardiac cycle, is the inflow pressure for most organs and therefore a main determinant of organ perfusion pressure. The kidneys appear particularly sensitive to perioperative decreases in perfusion pressure. However, there are no trials investigating how to best correct for increased venous outflow pressure or extravascular pressure. In clinical practice, venous and compartment pressures are often unknown. Central venous pressure can be measured in surgical patients with a central venous catheter, but compartment pressures (such as intraabdominal and intracranial pressures) are generally unknown. If compartment pressure is available or can be estimated, pathophysiological rationale suggests increasing the mean arterial pressure target by roughly the compartment pressure. For example, if clinicians aim for an organ perfusion pressure of 65 mm Hg and compartment pressure is 15 mm Hg, the inflow pressure (i.e. mean arterial pressure) might be maintained >80 mm Hg. Consensus recommendation 3: We recommend that treatment of hypotension be based on presumed underlying causes including vasodilation, hypovolaemia, bradycardia, and low cardiac output (strong recommendation, high-quality evidence). Hypotension can result from several underlying physiological processes acting alone or in combination. Consensus statement 2: In general surgery, there is no association between intraoperative systolic arterial pressures between 120 and 200 mm Hg and acute kidney injury and myocardial injury (low-quality evidence). Consensus recommendation 4: If intraoperative hypertension is treated, we recommend caution to avoid hypotension (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). A single-centre observational analysis reported no relationship between intraoperative systolic arterial pressures of 120\u2013200 mm Hg and myocardial injury., Some degree of hypertension should prompt treatment. However, given that reasonable levels of hypertension appear relatively benign, available data suggest that hypertension should be treated incrementally, if at all, with the goal of avoiding hypotension, which undoubtedly causes organ injury at some level. Consensus statement 3: Continuous intraoperative arterial pressure monitoring helps clinicians reduce the severity and duration of hypotension compared to intermittent arterial pressure monitoring (high-quality evidence). Arterial catheters are used to monitor haemodynamic fluctuations during complex operations and in high-risk patients with significant comorbidities., There is convincing evidence that continuous compared to intermittent arterial pressure monitoring identifies more intraoperative hypotension, thereby helping clinicians reduce the duration and severity of hypotension.vs intermittent oscillometric (with blinded continuous finger-cuff) arterial pressure monitoring also resulted in substantially less hypotension during induction of anaesthesia. During surgery, continuous arterial pressure monitoring with an arterial catheter detected nearly twice as much hypotension as oscillometric arterial pressure monitoring in a randomised trial in 306 patients having noncardiac surgery. Consensus statement 4: Postoperative hypotension is often unrecognised and might be more important than intraoperative hypotension because it is often prolonged (moderate-quality evidence). However, postoperative hypotensive harm thresholds remain unclear. Hypotension is common in postoperative patients because of antihypertensive medications, inadequate intravenous fluid administration, adverse effects of some anaesthetic drugs, intraoperative and ongoing blood loss, the inflammatory response to surgery, arrhythmias, and impaired myocardial function. Most hospitals therefore establish guidance on when to alert medical staff, for example, when systolic arterial pressure is <90 mm Hg. Large observational studies have identified associations between postoperative hypotension and organ injury, especially acute kidney injury, cardiovascular events, readmission, and mortality. A challenge is that it has proven difficult to modify postoperative arterial pressures. For example, a delayed restart of chronic antihypertensive medications has no appreciable effect on ward arterial pressures.vs continuing angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers did not reduce myocardial injury or hypotension within 48 h of surgery. Beta blockers reduce the risk of myocardial injury but cause hypotension (and strokes).", "type": "Document"}

This assumption is wrong. Mortality in the 30 days after surgery is 140 times higher than intraoperative mortality., The most common causes of 30-day postoperative mortality are major bleeding, Ward hypotension, hypertension, and hypoxaemia are common, profound, and prolonged, and are nearly always missed by conventional vital sign monitoring at 4-h intervals., Cardiopulmonary events do not occur in isolation. Tachycardia and hypoxaemia commonly coexist, and often culminate in hypotension which is strongly associated with myocardial injury and death., The difficulty is that rapid response teams largely prevent further damage after patients experience critical events; patients would be better served if we could detect deterioration early and therefore prevent critical episodes. Continuous ward monitoring seems likely to identify patients who are getting into trouble before they become critical, thus moving us beyond \u2018failure to rescue'prevention of critical events. Battery-powered untethered vital sign monitoring systems are already available for ward use. Using them will be the first step towards detecting instability in ward patients early enough to intervene effectively.

Conversion to open was agreed as the inability to complete the dissection through an MIS approach, usually requiring an incision larger than that required to remove the specimen. If a conversion from MIS to open occurred, it should be clearly reported. Prehabilitation was agreed upon as the process that occurs between the time of diagnosis and the beginning of treatment, and includes physical, nutritional and psychological assessments to prepare a patient for the stress of surgery by improving their preoperative functional status. The panel agreed that a prehabilitation program should be implemented in elderly patients undergoing surgery but were not able to agree upon the timing or elements for a prehabilitation program from the literature. Prehabilitation was distinguished from ERAS\u2014multimodal perioperative care pathways designed to achieve early recovery after major surgery by using evidence-based interventions\u2014as ERAS protocols encompass components across the preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative periods and prehabilitation programs occur before surgery. There was a strong recommendation to adopt ERAS protocols in all elderly patients undergoing elective major abdominal surgery. The group recommended the specific elements used and compliance with ERAS protocol elements should be described. There was consensus that the outcomes that should be reported in perioperative care of older adults undergoing major abdominal surgery included: delirium; postoperative complications; LOS; and readmission. None of the screened articles investigated the effect of any of the above interventions on postoperative quality of life (QoL) in older adult, and given the heterogeneity of different QoL tools, the expert panel could not make a recommendation for including QoL. The quality of evidence and strength of the recommendations are seen in Table", "type": "Document"}

The intervention-control groups were not fully compared enough to derive the quality of the randomization process indirectly. The two studies included in the analysis of the outcome of 30-day complications had opposite findings, with one demonstrating fewer complications with ERAS and the other less with conventional care.

The main goal was to provide evidence-based recommendations for perioperative prehabilitation in the older adult population in order to standardize preoperative workup, implement patient\u2019s physiological, functional and psychological status, and surgical treatment. Additionally, the vast expertise in perioperative management and MIS of the Expert Panel further enriched and drove the consensus discussion, especially in the topics with low level of evidence. What the panel found during this process was a lack of standard definitions for prehabilitation, ERAS, and their components, as well as a lack of strong evidence outside of clinical experience to support their use in the perioperative care of older adults undergoing major abdominal surgery. In the current work, almost all of the given recommendations were conditional, based on low to very low certainty of evidence, with the exception of KQ21 dealing with ERAS programs in colorectal surgery. In many key questions, the panel could not provide an evidence-based recommendation due to lack of evidence, small sample size, or high risk of bias reported. In these cases, the panel made suggestions based on their clinical experience to provide guidance on the practical application of MIS, prehabilitation, and ERAS topics for practicing surgeons. With this approach, the panel reached consensus on providing conditional recommendations supporting the adoption of preoperative optimization among older adults across all specialities and the project achieved its objectives to inform the global perioperative community on perioperative care of older adults. With the lack of standardized terms and evidence exposed, the project added additional value in providing universal definitions and recommendations for reporting on perioperative care components. These definitions can be applied in future studies to ensure investigators use common terminology and outcomes. Despite the wide acceptance of these concepts, gaps in the literature across surgical specialties in the risk stratification of comorbidity and frailty, the application of MIS, and the details for application of prehabilitation were also highlighted. This investigation can help guide future work for evidence-based clinical application of these perioperative care concepts in older adults.", "type": "Document"}

The ERAS Society has published many guidelines on elective surgery and more recently emergency laparotomy [trauma laparotomy hence an additional argument for a new guideline. There is no comprehensive current guideline on how to adapt ERAS pathways to torso and polytrauma patients who require admission to intensive care (ICU), both for post\u2010operative and non\u2010operative care and for all age groups throughout their hospital stay. The ability to apply many of the ERAS guidelines may be problematic as there is a need to address reduced mobility, requirement for ICU mechanical support, inability to apply early removal of devices, and need for variable nutritional support as well as a number of other controversial questions within the care of the injured. The potential benefits include following evidence\u2010based structured approaches to care, proactive interventions, and reduction of adverse events leading to reduced morbidity and mortality after trauma. The principles behind the ERAS concept include pre\u2010operative, intra\u2010operative, and post\u2010operative guidelines of care aimed at reducing physiological stress, thereby reducing the hospital length of stay, complications, and to ensure early discharge [ A trauma\u2010specific guideline that addresses all aspects of the \u2018polytrauma\u2019 patient, irrespective of whether due to penetrating or blunt trauma, with major tissue injury, traumatic shock, systemic inflammatory response, and at risk of organ failure after torso and extremity injury (while excluding burns, drowning and isolated brain injury), is thus required to guide safe and ideal practice [ In addition to the challenge of a lack of guidelines comes the extreme variation in the ability of health systems to manage major trauma, despite the criteria for trauma centers and systems evolving over the last four decades [ For the sake of readability and grouping of recommendations the results of the ERATIC guidelines have been divided into three papers with part 1 covering the introduction and main methods, the PICO questions related to initial management, operative and non\u2010operative care, part 2 covers the post\u2010operative and intensive care aspects (with some overlap from part 1 highlighted at the end of part 1), and part 3 covers the aspects of ethical decision\u2010making, end\u2010of\u2010life care and trauma systems requirements impacting ultimate outcome (The papers documenting paper 2 and 3 are found as https://doi.org/10.1002/wjs.70004 and https://doi.org/10.1002/wjs.70003 in the World Journal of Surgery).", "type": "Document"}

The group was from varied surgical (trauma surgeons, general surgeons, vascular surgeons, pediatric, and orthopedic surgeons) or anesthesia critical\u2010care backgrounds, from various world\u2010regions and country income levels as well as representing both sexes. Topic lists were generated, and search questions were derived using the patient, intervention, comparator (where available), outcome (PICO), or similar approaches and using the definitions provided in paper 1. The topics were divided across the spectrum to smaller teams of two or three reviewers, with different backgrounds and from different countries, based on their expertise, to perform a literature review of English language publications and then to generate summary recommendations using the GRADE structure, with the grading of the summarized evidence rather than each article considered for inclusion, given this is not a systematic review.

The operative phase includes urgent surgical intervention, and this may be in the form of early total care or damage control surgery.

There were no conceptual or major content disagreements noted during either round of the Delphi. A summary of the ERAS elements for intra\u2010 and post\u2010operative care and grading of recommendations with their respective level of evidence are listed in Table A. Acute phase decision\u2010making\u2014pre\u2010operative 1. Pre\u2010hospital care of trauma: PICO: In the major trauma and polytrauma patient, what are the pre\u2010hospital interventions that improve survival and reduce hospital length of stay compared to no intervention? Pre\u2010hospital trauma management is associated with reduced mortality when evidence\u2010based recommendations are followed. These include reducing the scene\u2010time, limiting pre\u2010hospital interventions in urban environments to life\u2010sustaining care, and control of bleeding [ 1. Summary and recommendations: Rapid transfer to appropriate level of care with minimal fluid therapy or transfusions and attempts at bleeding control are the mainstay of prehospital trauma care. Tranexamic acid may be administered as per local policies. Advanced airway interventions should be restricted to selected patients and long\u2010distance transfers. Level of evidence: Moderate Grade of recommendation: Strong B. Trauma operative and non\u2010operative definitive care 2. Surgical approach\u2014operative decision\u2010making PICO: In polytrauma patients after initial assessment in the emergency department, what is the decision\u2010making philosophy the surgeon should follow to improve outcome? The surgical approach to a trauma patient is guided by the physiology primarily and secondarily by the organ injuries identified. Selective NOM (SNOM) is standard of care for hemodynamically normalized blunt injuries. For most penetrating trauma in the majority of centers operative intervention is the approach of choice, especially for those with physiological impairment with \u2018damage control resuscitation and damage control surgery\u2019 utilized as needed with definitive care more readily actioned with modern hemostatic resuscitation. In selected patients at selected centers with extensive penetrating trauma experience in correctly evaluated imaged patients, who are physiologically normal or improving, some evidence suggests NOM to be acceptable. For blunt trauma, especially those meeting polytrauma criteria consideration is given to initial use of \u2018damage control\u2019 philosophies and the use of various hemorrhage control adjuncts to temporize the patient while restoration of physiology is undertaken. Adjuncts may include temporary vascular shunting, other procoagulant products, or other adjuncts to prevent contamination or to control bleeding [ Most of the evidence for abdominal and chest damage control is from retrospective studies although the findings are similar in multiple centers across a number of countries, from the USA to South Africa. Orthopedic damage control in polytrauma patients is well established with better definition of the population and clinical guidelines in a recent major study [ One main challenge remains the management of penetrating injuries to junctional areas where the \u2018cavity of choice\u2019 is less clear (e.g., thoraco\u2010abdominal\u2014bleeding from both chest and into the abdomen and penetrating cervical trauma with bleeding also from the chest). Using FAST\u2010ultrasound screening, along with chest X\u2010ray, is a reliable method to choose the correct cavity [ For this reason, the training of surgeons and anesthesiologists in trauma\u2010surgical decision\u2010making remains a mainstay of achieving better outcomes for trauma patients [ 2. Summary and recommendations: Clinical judgment is difficult to teach, but in trauma care this is an important aspect when deciding when to operate, when to be selective and how to perform the procedures, whether to go for definitive surgery (also called Early Total Care\u2014ETC), or to temporize with damage control philosophies. It is recommended that the most experienced (trauma\u2010trained) surgeon should be the decision\u2010maker and perform the surgery. Level of evidence: Moderate Recommendation grade: Strong 3. Non\u2010Operative Management (NOM) versus Operative Management PICO: (3a1) In trauma patients who meet the current indications for NOM in solid organ injuries when is it still necessary to operate? (3a2) What about NOM in penetrating trauma? (3b) What is the role of repeat imaging after NOM for solid organ injuries in trauma patients? (3c) Does Early versus late feeding improve outcome in the trauma patient with solid organ injury? (3d) In solid organ injury managed by NOM, what is the role of bedrest compared to normal activity of daily living? (3e) In trauma patients who successfully undergo NOM of solid organ injury, what is the safe return to normal activity and sports activity timeline? The shift over the last decades from mainly operative to mainly non\u2010operative management (NOM) of solid organ injuries has been facilitated by access to high resolution CT scanning and improved resuscitation strategies. NOM in solid organ injuries is supported by a vast body of evidence [ In penetrating injuries (both stab and gunshot wounds), because of the high rate of non\u2010therapeutic explorative laparotomies, there is increasing support for NOM in selected trauma centers with extensive penetrating trauma experience, for hemodynamically normal(ized) patients with isolated injury to solid organs identified on CT scan, most notably the liver and kidneys [ The evidence for routine repeat imaging for solid organ injuries has been consistent throughout the last 10\u201315 years, concluding that there is limited value in routine repeat imaging, in those with an uncomplicated hospital course [ There is no evidence to suggest early enteral feeding is contra\u2010indicated or has negative sequalae in NOM for solid organ injuries, provided that the patient condition allows for feeding. We suggest early enteral nutrition in all patients with bowel continuity [ The latest version of the American Pediatric Surgeons Association (APSA) guidelines (2018) confirmed support for the existing guidelines mandating avoiding contact sports and hard physical activity for grade of injury +2 in weeks (i.e., grade 4 = 6 weeks) for children [ 3. Summary and recommendations: 3a1. There is a high level of evidence to support NOM in hemodynamically normal patients with solid organ injuries after blunt trauma and no other indication for laparotomy provided the patient is appropriately monitored for deterioration. Level of evidence: High Recommendation grade: Strong 3a2. For penetrating injuries there is low level of evidence for the use of NOM in isolated liver or kidney injuries. SNOM in penetrating trauma is an option in selected experienced high\u2010volume centers with rapid access to operation facilities in case of SNOM failure. Level of evidence: Low Recommendation grade: Weak 3b. There is moderate to strong evidence for not repeating CT imaging for uncomplicated solid organ injuries. However, for grade 3\u20135 splenic injuries that have not been embolized we recommend contrast enhanced US or CT on day 3\u20135 to exclude pseudoaneurysm. Level of evidence: Moderate to high Recommendation grade: Strong 3c. We strongly recommend early enteral feeding for patients with NOM unless there is a specific contraindication because of the low incidence of harm. Level of evidence: High Recommendation grade: Strong 3d. Routine bedrest after NOM in solid organ injuries should be avoided and a limited period of activity restriction is recommended according to the patient age, type (grade) of injury and organ involved. Level of evidence: Moderate Recommendation grade: Strong 3e. Prolonged activity restrictions may be beneficial for contact sports and intense activity. Level of evidence: Moderate Recommendation grade: Strong C. Specific organ injuries 4. Chest Wall Injury 4a. Chest wall Injuries and Rib Fixation PICO: (4a) What are the indications for operative rib fixation and the optimal timing in polytrauma and ICU\u2010requiring trauma patients with or without TBI? Surgical rib stabilization has experienced renewed interest over the past 5\u201310 years. There is, however, no level\u20101 evidence determining which patients benefit from surgical stabilization of rib fractures (SSRF) or the optimal timing thereof. The highest level of evidence exists on ventilated patients with flail chest, in this subgroup SSRF is associated with 2.8 days more ventilator free days based on a medium size multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) from North American centers [ Several non\u2010randomized observational studies documented good outcomes of chest wall injured patients with SSRF in both ventilated and non\u2010ventilated patients with low complication rates. The generalization of these results is difficult because of the nature of the studies, the selection bias, and the lack of control population. There are however, two prospective studies of rib\u2010fixation in TBI polytrauma patients and both show some benefit [ One RCT showed earlier fixation to have better outcomes than later (> 48 h) with some evidence of less inflammatory response in the early group and a shortened ventilator, ICU and hospital length of stay [ The focus of future interventional studies must achieve significantly better outcomes with SSRF than these contemporary outcomes with comprehensive non\u2010operative care. If it is decided to follow a SSRF management pathway, theoretically earlier surgical intervention is beneficial (compared to later surgery), but this is also the timeframe when multimodal pain therapy is likely to maximize its effect, thus further studies specifically focusing on timing of interventions are required to address this clinical question. 4a. Summary and recommendations: There is moderate quality evidence to support rib\u2010fixation for flail chest or > 3 contiguous fractures, those with TBI and in the older patient, to reduce pneumonia, tracheostomy, ICU, and total hospital LOS. There is no evidence to prefer early versus later fixation, in selected patient populations. Level of evidence: Moderate Recommendation grade: Weak 4b. Chest wall injury: chest drain management PICO: (4b1) and (4b2) What are the indications for and the management of chest drains in the trauma patient and (4b3) at what point in the management is safe removal possible? The role of chest drains in the trauma patient are accepted practice as the treatment for hemothorax or pneumothorax, whether in the emergency department, the operating room, or in the ICU secondary often to procedural complications. Placement may be empiric in the resuscitation phase, after initial assessment and chest X\u2010ray, or even after CT\u2010scan, when the measured size of the pneumothorax is larger than 35 mm at the level of the third ribspace and in patients at risk of tension pneumothorax, such as due to positive pressure ventilation [ Suture closure or an occlusive dressing are equally effective. Conservative management of pneumothorax, even in those requiring general anesthesia (avoiding nitrous oxide), is now advocated in selected patients. Mobility can be enhanced and removal facilitated by early physiotherapy, good analgesia, and exclusion of sub\u2010pulmonary hemothorax. This can result in tube removal in under 48 h in most simple traumatic hemothorax or pneumothorax as reported in sentinel papers from the 90s [ Smaller chest tubes, including the use of pig\u2010tail catheters, appear to be as effective at drainage of pneumothorax and hemothorax with no increased risk of empyema and with smaller chest tubes providing better patient satisfaction. Removal using a Valsalva technique or a modified Valsalva technique is advocated [ 4b. Summary and recommendations: 4b1. Insertion of chest tube: There is strong evidence to support the therapeutic and prophylactic use of chest tubes for drainage of blood and air in the pleural space on an individualized basis. Level of evidence: High Recommendation grade: Strong 4b2.1. Size and position of insertion of chest tube: The optimal drain position is apico\u2010posterior. There appear to be no advantage of using larger tubes than 16Fr. 4b2.2. Complications are common and well detailed. The use of ultrasound can help guide the operator to place the tube appropriately. 4b2.3. Smaller tubes and pigtails along with valve\u2010based mobile drains reduce impaired mobility with equivalent drainage ability. Level of evidence: Moderate Recommendation grade: Strong 4c. Removal of chest tube: After appropriate clinical and sometimes radiological assessment the drains are often placed on low pressure suction and transitioned to water\u2010seal (off suction). Removal is considered when less than 200 mL of fluid drains in 24 h and there is no re\u2010accumulation of pneumothorax on \u2018water\u2010seal\u2019 in about 6 h. Drains can safely be removed, at either maximal inspiration or expiration, with the patient still in the ICU on positive\u2010pressure ventilation. Removal should include skin closure with either sutures or occlusive dressing or even cyanoacrylate glue. Routine post\u2010removal chest X\u2010ray is controversial. Level of evidence: Moderate Recommendation grade: Strong 5. Aortic Injury PICO: (5a) In trauma patients with minimal blunt aortic injury (BAI) is operative or non\u2010operative management required and what is the optimal management strategy compared to open surgery? (5b) For Moderate to severe aortic injury what is the optimal timing of repair: immediate versus delayed? Many BAI diagnosed with high resolution cross\u2010sectional imaging techniques have minimal aortic injury [ In a recent review of 2821 patients with blunt traumatic aortic injury, 75% underwent early (within 24 h of injury) thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR). Mortality was more than twofold in patients undergoing early TEVAR compared with delayed TEVAR (9.8% vs. 4.4%; p = 0.001). This mortality benefit persisted across injury severity groups and was independent of serious extra\u2010thoracic injuries. Patients undergoing delayed repair have improved survival compared with those repaired within the first 24 h of injury in spite of similar injury patterns and severity [ 5. Summary and recommendations: 5a. There is moderate quality evidence to recommend non\u2010operative management with medical therapy for minimal aortic injuries, defined as grade I or II by the Society of Vascular Surgery Grading Scale. Serial cross\u2010sectional imaging is recommended to assure radiographic resolution of injury. Level of evidence: Moderate Recommendation grade: Strong 5b1. There is weak quality evidence to recommend that patients with BAI should undergo TEVAR at, or greater than, 24 h (compared to under 24 h) to improve overall survival. 5b2. Open surgery is restricted to a limited subset of patients in extremis. Level of evidence: Low Recommendation grade: Weak 6. Splenic Injury PICO: For major splenic injury, is main artery versus selective embolization (SAE) better and is it safer to embolize versus observe in high grade injuries? How effective is immune function after SAE for major splenic injury? As an important management concept, grossly unstable patients with intraabdominal bleeding require surgery and if the spleen is injured, a splenectomy should be performed. There is strong evidence that for the adult patient who is stable or has normalized upon resuscitation, a CT scan with ongoing extravasation from a splenic injury should undergo SAE [ Existing moderate evidence suggests that an embolized spleen retains immune function, and therefore conditionally suggest that these patients should not be immunized [ 6. Summary and recommendations: 6a. Spleen injury can be managed non\u2010operatively for low grade injury and with addition of AE for higher grade injury. Where to embolize anatomically is controversial, but we conditionally recommend non\u2010selective SAE. 6b. Immunity appears to be retained after SAE. Level of evidence: Moderate Grade of recommendation: Strong 7. Liver Injury PICO: (7a) Which trauma patients benefit from liver packing versus resection? (7b) For liver injury when is it best to embolize versus observe? (7c) What is the role of ERCP in the management of hepatic trauma and the optimal timing of drainage for liver trauma related biliary leakage? There has been a dramatic shift in the treatment of blunt liver injuries over the past 20 years; from mainly operative to mostly NOM with or without AE. Improved resuscitation strategies have allowed patients to stop bleeding and increase the NOM rates [ The hemodynamically grossly compromised patient who does not respond to resuscitation still needs an operation (30% of grade 4\u20135 injuries), and mortality in this group remains high at 40%\u201350% [ 7. Summary and recommendations: 7a. The hemodynamically compromised patient who does not respond to resuscitation still needs an operation which should be urgently undertaken. With damage control resuscitation strategies, these liver injuries can mostly be managed with systematic packing and TAC until normalized physiology. Level of evidence: Moderate Recommendation grade: Strong 7b. Patients with blunt liver injury and who are hemodynamically stable after resuscitation should undergo NOM. Angiography should be reserved for patients with clinical signs of ongoing bleeding (not only persistent CT\u2010contrast extravasation or hemobilia). Level of evidence: Moderate Recommendation grade: Strong 7c. For patients with suspected bile duct injury there is moderate evidence supporting closed suction drainage for bile leak. ERCP should be reserved for patients with suspicion of CBD injury and if persistent high output bile leak after several weeks. Level of evidence for closed suction drainage: Moderate Level of evidence for ERCP: Low Recommendation grade: Weak 8. Pancreatic Injury PICO: (8a) When should a patient with pancreas injury undergo observation versus operative management? (8b) When is distal pancreatectomy the procedure of choice? (8c) What is the optimal management of grade 4 and 5 injury? The literature shows that the treatment of pancreatic injuries (PI) varies widely, and there is lack of prospective and well controlled retrospective studies. PI are associated with high morbidity rates. However, there is support for NOM of grade 1 and 2 (no main duct injury) PIs [ 8. Summary and recommendations: 8a. Grade 1 and 2 Pancreatic injuries (no ductal injury) should initially be treated non\u2010operatively. Level of evidence: Moderate Recommendation grade: Strong 8b. Grade 3 injuries (to the left of the superior mesenteric artery) can be treated with distal pancreatectomy but there remains the risk of fistula. For those managed with NOM there is a risk of sepsis and pseudocyst. Level of evidence: High Recommendation grade: Strong 8c. Grade 4 and 5 injuries should initially be treated with wide drainage rather than primary resection with subsequent intervention planning as indicated. Level of evidence: Moderate Recommendation grade: Weak 9. Kidney Injury PICO: (9a) In the patient with high grade renal injury\u2014what is the role of NOM with or without angiography? What is the role of NOM versus nephrectomy? (9b) What is the role for stenting of renal vascular injury or pelvi\u2010ureteric injury? The literature on renal injuries (RI) is consistent over the last decades but mainly consists of retrospective studies. There is wide agreement for NOM of OIS grades 1 and 2 injuries. For high grade (OIS grade 3\u20135) renal injuries, the success rate depends on injury grade, hemodynamic stability and transfusion requirements as well as the presence of urinary extravasation. With improved resuscitation strategies more patients stabilize and lend themselves to NOM. However, the patients with high grade RI who require an operation are most likely to undergo nephrectomy [ Angiography and embolization are associated with severe complications and should be performed only when clinically indicated: in the presence of clinical signs of ongoing bleeding and contrast extravasation on CT scan, a delayed presentation pseudoaneurysm, or traumatic arterio\u2010venous malformation. A devascularized kidney, when diagnosed on CT, is unlikely to benefit from stenting as warm ischemia time will always be too long [ In the pediatric population, there is wide consensus for NOM of all grades of RI when physiology allows [ 9. Summary and recommendations: 9a. Renal injury: There is strong evidence supporting NOM in all grade RI in hemodynamically normal or normalized patients (including children) with no other indication for laparotomy. The patients with high grade RI who require an operation will likely undergo nephrectomy. Level of evidence: Moderate Recommendation grade: Strong 9b. Urinary extravasation: In the presence of urinary extravasation, repeat imaging should be considered and a JJ stent or percutaneous drainage offered if increasing leak or in the presence of infection. Angiography with embolization should only be performed with clinical signs of persistent hematuria and contrast extravasation on CT. Arterial stenting is not indicated for a devascularized kidney diagnosed on CT scan. Level of evidence: Low Recommendation grade: Weak D. Early intraoperative and post\u2010operative aspects 10. Timing of relook surgery in damage control. PICO: (10a) Is there an optimal timing for relook after damage control surgery (DCS) chest and abdomen with an open abdomen? (10b) What about timing for definitive orthopedic surgery in stable versus unstable patients? DCS and temporary abdominal closure (TAC) has for almost three decades been the main strategy in patients who are hemodynamically compromised after trauma, requiring massive transfusions, and requiring operative management for abdominal injuries and bleeding. Literature in this area is of limited quality and mainly consists of retrospective cohort descriptions. Improved resuscitation strategies have reduced the need for laparotomies and DCS. However, the indications remain the same even if fewer qualify. Existing and more recent evidence is not able to define a magic timeline for relook surgery but rather underlines the fact that physiology determines timing, and that the earlier definitive closure can be achieved the better. The patient, injury pattern, and type of resuscitation affects this decision. We would suggest to aim for 24\u201348 h for torso reoperations [ 10. Summary and recommendations: 10a. Timing of Surgery: For re\u2010look surgery of the chest or abdomen, or for vascular temporary shunts, the most rapid return to the OR should be guided by organ injury and physiological restoration but ideally within 24\u201348 h. Level of evidence: Moderate Recommendation grade: Weak 10b. Timing of Orthopedic interventions: Early total care and repair of all injuries is potentially possible in the patient who has major injury without physiological compromise; however, for the patient who is defined as polytrauma delaying initial orthopedic intervention is advised and this should be guided by physiological status and may be augmented with the use of certain biomarkers to identify reversal of the inflammatory state. Level of evidence: Moderate Recommendation grade: Weak 11. Skin asepsis PICO: Does the choice of skin preparation solution impact the incidence of wound sepsis in the trauma patient and if so, which is the preferred agent and carrier solution? Surgical site infection (SSI) is common after trauma surgery [rather than the actual antiseptic agent in the solution [in alcohol as the preferred agent for non\u2010orthopedic procedures [ 11. Summary and recommendations: There is high quality evidence and current supporting guidelines that prefer alcohol\u2010based chlorhexidine solution. There is overall high\u2010quality evidence that chlorhexidine in alcohol is the skin preparation of choice. Povidone may be a suitable alternative if used in alcohol and not as the aqueous solution, particularly for orthopedic procedures. Level of evidence: Moderate Recommendation grade: Strong 12. Antibiotic prophylaxis and duration PICO: (12a) In trauma patients, particularly under specific conditions, does the administration of antibiotic prophylaxis reduce overall sepsis complications compared to no antibiotic use? (12b) What is the recommended duration of antibiotic prophylaxis in specific populations after trauma? Trauma patients constitute a high\u2010risk population prone to infection, as trauma and interventions can disrupt the body's natural barriers, leading to contamination. Antibiotic prophylaxis (AP) is a commonly used intervention in trauma care aimed at reducing infection rates [ An updated Cochrane systematic review and meta\u2010analysis on AP for preventing meningitis in basilar skull fractures was published in 2015 [ A single\u2010center case series with a systematic review, published in 2023, evaluated AP for penetrating traumatic brain injury. Although the literature review did not reveal any significant benefit of AP, all patients who did not receive AP developed CNS infection in their case series. Consequently, the authors proposed a short course of therapeutic antibiotics for patients with penetrating traumatic brain injury [ An evidence\u2010based consensus statement from the Neurocritical Care Society conditionally recommends one dose of antimicrobials prior to EVD insertion and strongly recommends against the continuous use of antimicrobials during placement [ For other truncal trauma the recommendations follow that of clean contaminated surgery, namely that in general, no prophylaxis should be given to blunt trauma patients unless a hollow viscus injury is suspected or identified. Antibiotic prophylaxis for penetrating trauma should not last more than 24 h in the absence of hollow viscus injuries and broad\u2010spectrum antibiotics with aerobic and anaerobic bacteria coverage are preferred while aminoglycosides should be avoided. In the case of hemorrhagic shock and associated acute kidney injury, the dose of antibiotics should be adjusted with a second dose if more than 4\u20136 units of blood are required [ 12. Summary and recommendations: Antibiotic prophylaxis and duration: There is high quality evidence and numerous consensus guidelines to support perioperative prophylactic antibiotic therapy for maximally 24 h with appropriate re\u2010dosing for extensive blood loss (4\u20136 units) and prolonged surgery (> 4 h). There is low evidence to extend antibiotic prophylaxis after 24 h in trauma and this should be considered on an individual basis and whether there is cavity contamination, giving short\u2010course therapy in preference to long\u2010course prophylaxis. 12a. 24\u2010h maximal prophylaxis Level of evidence: High Recommendation grade: Strong 12b. Extension of Prophylaxis beyond 24 h: if needed use therapeutic course Level of evidence: Moderate Recommendation grade: Strong", "type": "Document"}

Anesthesia PICO: In cases requiring anesthesia for polytrauma and major trauma procedures what are the optimal balanced anesthesia options for best survival in this patient group? Induction and maintenance of anesthesia and airway management carries a risk of cardiovascular collapse, especially in the hypovolemic patient. Fluid resuscitation should commence prior to induction of anesthesia in all hypotensive patients and those normotensive patients deemed to be significantly hypovolemic. Administration of anesthesia should be delayed until the operating theater or other point of hemorrhage control unless the patient's physiology mandates otherwise. Rational choices for administration of anesthesia are ketamine induction and maintenance outside the operating room with consideration of low dose volatile maintenance of anesthesia. Level of evidence: Moderate Recommendation grade: Strong 17. Abdominal Closure tray and glove changes PICO: Does the type of hand\u2010scrub or the changing of gloves and instruments on closure of open surgical sites reduce the surgical site sepsis? There is high quality evidence to support changing of gloves and using a new set of instruments for definitive sheath closure in abdominal surgery, extrapolation to other surgical procedures can be cautiously advocated. Level of evidence: Moderate Recommendation grade: Weak 19a. Resuscitation/use of blood products and coagulation management PICO: What is the most appropriate choice of resuscitation fluids for trauma patients who require fluid resuscitation from the resuscitation phase to the post\u2010operative phase? Trauma patients should be resuscitated according to a locally relevant massive hemorrhage protocol. This protocol should aim to restore, as near as possible, whole blood to the bleeding patient. As part of these protocols, plasma components should be administered as early as possible. Ideally these should be guided by dynamic coagulation assays such as thromboelstography if available. Crystalloid should be used as a last resort. Level of evidence: Moderate Level of recommendation: Strong PICO: (19b) What is the role for supplemental medications and procoagulant blood products in the trauma patient? The use of tranexamic acid should be considered in different trauma systems depending on pre\u2010hospital transfer times and access to point of care coagulation tests or dynamic coagulation assays such as thromboelstography if available. Cryoprecipitate is not beneficial given empirically in the early phase, whereas fibrinogen and other factor concentrates may be administered based on tests of coagulation as close to the point of care as possible. Level of evidence: High Level of recommendation: Strong PICO: What is the best ventilation management strategy for trauma patients in the Operating Room\u2014Does ARDSnet apply prior to ICU admission? Evidence exists for optimal ventilator management of the trauma patient in the operating room. Best practices do include low to moderate tidal volume (6\u20138 mL/kg), moderate adjusted PEEP (5\u20138 cm H2O), and low driving pressures (< 15 cm H2O), although up to 10 mL/kg tidal volume may be considered acceptable in the operation room environment.

Lymph-node metastasis is also frequently encountered; therefore, it is not uncommon for the malignancy to be at an advanced stage at diagnosis. There are a significant number of cases in which surgery is indicated inasmuch as widespread metastasis is uncommon, unlike the case in thoracic esophageal cancer. A major problem in surgery for cervical esophageal cancer is that simultaneous laryngectomy is also indicated in many cases. Under these circumstances, surgery may be performed after tumor shrinkage is obtained by preoperative chemoradiotherapy in an effort to preserve the larynx, or radical chemoradiotherapy may be administered, followed by salvage surgery in the event of detection of residual disease or recurrence. Larynx-preserving surgery is indicated for patients in whom the tumor has not invaded the pharynx, larynx, or trachea. Conservation of vocal function is the utmost benefit of this option, although it is associated with the risk of aspiration or pneumonia; not uncommonly, primary tracheotomy is required. Therefore, sufficient consideration should be given as to the indication and choice of operative procedure, e.g., an additional aspiration-preventive measure such as laryngeal elevation could be employed. Combined laryngectomy (laryngopharyngoesophagectomy) is indicated for patients with tumors invading the pharynx, larynx, and trachea. The procedure may even be indicated for patients without direct pharyngeal invasion, in whom sufficient preservation of the esophagus to perform anastomosis with intestinal graft is difficult. Marked lowering of QOL due to loss of vocal function poses a serious problem in patients who have undergone combined laryngectomy.

Therefore, it is common practice to perform a right thoracotomy to meet the need for adequate dissection of the mediastinal lymph nodes, along with esophagectomy and lymphadenectomy in lymph-node stations of the cervical, thoracic and abdominal regions to complete the entire extent of resection. Depth of invasion beyond T1a-MM is a predictor of lymph-node metastasis, and stage T1b-SM 2, 3 lesions should be counted as advanced carcinomas [ The extent of lymph-node dissection should be determined according to individual cases after preoperative evaluation of the location, size, and depth of invasion of the main lesion by imaging modalities such as CT, ultrasonography (US), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and PET, because the distribution and incidence of lymph-node metastasis vary with the aforementioned parameters. Based on the analysis of data from a nationwide registry conducted by the Japan Esophageal Society [ It is common practice that radical surgery for thoracic esophageal carcinoma is usually accomplished using a combination of three approaches: the cervical, thoracic, and abdominal approaches. The mediastinal approach has also been proposed as an alternative to the cervical approach for dissection of the cervical paraesophageal lymph nodes [#101]. Thoracoscopy-assisted esophagectomy with esophageal reconstruction has been reported as promising surgical procedures, in view of its minimal invasiveness, radical curability, and favorable long-term outcomes, although studies are ongoing. Various procedures such as endoscopy/laparoscopy-assisted esophagectomy with esophageal reconstruction and mediastinoscopy- or laparoscopy-assisted transhiatal esophagectomy (blunt resection of the esophagus) have been reported, and analysis of the reported cases during the 2011\u20132013 period in the National Clinical Database (NCD) revealed that 37.6% of the patients underwent endoscopy/laparoscopy-assisted surgery, which was reported as a safe approach with a mortality rate of 2.44%, against an overall mortality rate of 3.03%. The indications for this approach vary among institutions; it has been adopted even for cT3 cases at some institutions, and in patients who have received preoperative chemoradiotherapy at other institutions. Some techniques have been introduced for ensuring safe endoscopic surgery with a reduced operation time and improved accuracy of lymph-node dissection, including direct manipulations through a small incision via a minor thoracotomy, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) with minor thoracotomy, and hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery (HALS) involving manipulation with one hand inserted into the abdomen. While thoracic manipulations have been predominantly carried out with the patient in the left-lateral decubitus position, complete endoscopic thoracic manipulations have been increasingly performed with the patient placed in the prone position in recent years. Mediastinal lymph-node dissection using a mediastinoscope inserted via a cervical incision and laparoscopic transhiatal lymph-node dissection are some of the other procedures described. Reports have suggested that endoscopy/laparoscopy-assisted surgery enables conservation of the vasculature and nerves while confirming the microanatomy, and also increases the accuracy of lymph-node dissection, as it allows higher power visualization.

In Siewert\u2019s classification, type I lesions are often handled as carcinomas of the thoracic esophagus and type III lesions as cardiac carcinomas. Squamous cell carcinomas in Nishi\u2019s classification, on the other hand, are often treated as thoracic esophageal cancers. Opinions are still divided as to treatment policy and surgical procedures for adenocarcinomas in Nishi\u2019s classification and Siewert type II carcinoma. Carcinoma of the esophagogastric junction may be associated with extremely extensive lymph-node metastasis involving the cervical region, mediastinum, upper abdomen, and areas circumjacent to the abdominal aorta, and no unified view has been reached in regard to the appropriate extent of lymph-node dissection. The Japanese Gastric Cancer Association\u2014Japan Esophageal Society Joint Working Group has laid down recommendations in respect of the extent of lymphadenectomy on the grounds of the dissection effect index (rate of metastasis \u00d7 5-year survival rate of patients with metastasis) derived from retrospective analysis of data from surgically treated cases. The efficacy of lymphadenectomy in accordance with this scheme is expected to be verified by future accumulation of cases. Nevertheless, the problems with retrospective analysis of tumors is that the patients are confined to those with tumors measuring \u22644 cm in diameter and that the subject population includes only a small number of cases with dissection of the lymph nodes in the upper and middle mediastinal regions and areas circumjacent to the abdominal aorta. A prospective clinical study to evaluate the outcomes depending on the extent of lymphadenectomy for more advanced tumors is currently in progress. The Japanese Gastric Cancer Association\u2014Japan Esophageal Society Joint Working Group has proposed a definition of the esophagogastric junction based on endoscopic findings. In the algorithm used as a guide for the extent of lymph-node dissection, as well, lesions are defined according to the principal location of the center of the tumor, i.e., whether it is located proximal or distal to the junction. In the clinical practice setting, however, the junction can scarcely be identified by endoscopy in cases of advanced carcinoma, and that frequent, concurrent hiatal herniation interferes with positional estimation of the junction even by fluoroscopic exploration or CT. Thus, it may be said that only but an obscure judgment about the location of the junction can be obtained in the clinical setting. The extent of resection of the esophagus and stomach is determined in accordance with the extent of lymph-node dissection, and the range of operative procedures available extend from total esophagogastrectomy to lower third esophagectomy plus proximal gastrectomy. In surgery for carcinoma of the esophagogastric junction, the surgical invasiveness is affected not only by the extent of resection, but also by the surgical approach; therefore, the treatment selection must be approached by taking into consideration the balance between the surgical invasiveness and curability of the adopted procedure.", "type": "Document"}

Now, with the transformation and reconstitution of IACTA education and research cell into the newly formed Indian College of Cardiac Anaesthesia, F-TEE is bound to meet international standards. To ensure that the examinations are conducted in a transparent and foolproof manner, the guideline committee (formulated in 2010) of IACTA has taken the onus of formulating the guidelines for the same. These guidelines have been formally reviewed and updated since 2010 and are detailed here to serve as a guide to both the examinee and examiner ensuring standardization, efficiency, and competency of the IACTA F-TEE certification process.", "type": "Document"}

The accurate operation and interpretation of data obtained requires operator training, expertise, and skill. Both cognitive information and technical abilities are required for obtaining correct images. This implies a thorough understanding of the physical principles of sound transmission, as well as of fluid dynamics. With state-of-the-art echocardiography equipment, one acquires high quality two-dimensional (2D), three-dimensional or four-dimensional images, static and/or dynamic data sets to visualize the heart's structure and function, and applies Doppler principles and special technique such as speckle tracking technology to assess heart chamber, valve function, and the pericardial space including the aorta. Clinical usefulness and appropriate interpretation of such data must be performed through the integration of cardiovascular physiology and pathophysiology. The perioperative TEE fellowship (F-TEE) program offered by the Indian Association of Cardiovascular and Thoracic Anaesthesiologists (IACTA)/Indian College of Cardiac Anaesthesia is aimed at providing and improving the expertise of all echocardiographers manifesting a strong interest in attaining the goals as laid down by IACTA for achieving certification.", "type": "Document"}

Wenn diese nicht gew\u00e4hrleistet ist, kommt es schnell zu Hypox\u00e4mie und Bradykardie bis hin zum Herzstillstand. Sedierung und Narkose f\u00fchren durch einen Verlust des Tonus im Rachen sowie eine Verlagerung des Zungenbeins oft zur Obstruktion der bei Kindern ohnehin schon engen oberen Atemwege. Hinzu kommen besonders bei Fr\u00fch- und Neugeborenen noch Einschr\u00e4nkungen im Atemantrieb mit einem erh\u00f6hten Risiko von reflexbedingten Atempausen oder Spasmen des Larynx, geringere atemmechanische Reserven sowie eine erheblich geringere Apnoetoleranz.

Given the paucity of high-quality studies with regard to study design and execution in this perioperative field, recommendations were to a large part developed by subject-matter experts through consensus processes, taking into account the current scientific knowledge base and quality of evidence. This guideline may not be suitable for all clinical settings and patients and is not intended to define standards of care or absolute requirements for patient care; thus, assessment of appropriateness should be made on an individualized basis. Adherence to this guideline cannot guarantee successful outcomes, but recommendations should rather aid health care professionals and institutions to formulate plans and develop protocols for the improvement of the perioperative care of patients with OSA, considering patient-related factors, interventions, and resource availability. Given the groundwork of a comprehensive systematic literature review, these recommendations reflect the current state of knowledge and its interpretation by a group of experts at the time of publication.

Clinical research as it relates to best perioperative practices in OSA is burdened by numerous difficulties. The intraoperative setting involves a multitude of concurrent interventions and use of anesthetic medications, making it difficult to single out specific factors that potentially drive the adverse outcome. Lack of preoperative polysomnography data within publications represents a further challenge, making it difficult to include information of the impact of disease severity. Ethical considerations in study designs regarding the randomization of patients with known OSA were additional obstacles in this context. Furthermore, the task force recognizes that there is a tendency to underreport medical complications, rendering it difficult to establish the true perioperative risk. Presenting the current available evidence and its limitations should raise awareness regarding the need for high-quality studies in the future. Specific aims were to: (1) evaluate considerations of difficult airway management in patients with OSA, (2) assess the impact of individual anesthesia-related drugs and agents in the care of patients with OSA, and (3) evaluate best anesthetic techniques in this patient population. To achieve these aims, a question-driven approach was sought. In areas lacking sufficient published evidence, the task force sought to establish expert consensus while considering related literature. Patients affected by sleep-disordered breathing unrelated to OSA, including hypoventilation syndromes, periodic breathing, and central apnea unrelated to OSA, were not considered in this project.

A detailed summary of associations between OSA and various difficult airway management components is provided in Supplemental Digital Content, Table A1, http://links.lww.com/AA/C373. Among the included studies, 5 were retrospective and 11 were prospective controlled studies. Ten studies confirmed OSA by overnight polysomnography or electronic database entries, 3 used the STOP-Bang screening questionnaire, 2 identified patients by clinical diagnosis, and 1 used both polysomnography and the STOP-Bang questionnaire. In total, 266,603 patients were included in 16 studies. Of those patients, 32,052 had OSA (identified by polysomnography, electronic database, chart or clinical diagnoses, and STOP-Bang questionnaires) and 234,551 did not. In summary, 12 studies reported on difficult intubation, 6 on difficult mask ventilation, 2 on both difficult intubation and mask ventilation, and 2 on failed supraglottic airway. Several studies reported >1 difficult airway outcome. No study was available on the need for a surgical airway (Supplemental Digital Content, Table A1, http://links.lww.com/AA/C373).

Although 5 studies assessing difficult intubation and 1 study evaluating difficult mask ventilation did not find a significant association with OSA, the overall estimates showed a positive association between OSA and difficult airway.

DIFFICULT AIRWAY AND OSA > Prevalence of OSA in Patients With Difficult Intubation\nTwo studies elucidated the association between OSA and difficult intubation in a reverse manner by investigating the rate of OSA among patients with difficult intubation. In a retrospective study, Hiremath et al, using an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) \u226510 as a cutoff, found that 53% of patients with difficult airway had OSA. This finding was confirmed by a prospective controlled study by Chung et al. using an AHI \u22655 as a cutoff for OSA diagnosis. Patients who were determined to have a difficult airway were referred for polysomnography after surgery, and 66% were shown to have OSA. Kim and Lee showed that patients with an AHI \u226540 had a significantly higher prevalence of difficult intubation. For patients with OSA with AHIs \u226440, 40\u201370, and \u226570, the incidence of difficult intubation was 3.3%, 19.3%, and 27.6%, respectively. Anatomical skeletal and soft tissue changes may contribute to a difficult airway in OSA. However, these observations are \u201chypothesis-generating\u201d rather than \u201chypothesis-proving\u201d findings. The shared anatomical abnormalities explain the positive association between difficult airway and OSA. A number of studies evaluated the association of difficult airway management with OSA using the STOP-Bang questionnaire to identify patients at high risk of OSA. The sensitivity and specificity of the STOP-Bang questionnaire can vary according to the prevalence and severity of OSA. This variation can create false-positive and false-negative cases in both OSA and non-OSA groups, leading to potential misclassification bias. One of the contributing factors for adverse respiratory events in patients with OSA is the increased risk of difficult airway management, such as difficult intubation, difficult mask ventilation, or both. In a recent report, there were 7 litigation cases where OSA was associated with either death or anoxic brain injury due to difficult airway management in the form of failure to reintubate in the postoperative period. Knowledge about the association between OSA and difficult airway may improve perioperative airway management and decrease airway-related complications. In view of ethical considerations, it is difficult to perform RCTs in patients with OSA to determine its associations with difficult airway management. As a result, only observational prospective and retrospective studies are available in the literature. The end estimates of these studies indicate that there is an increased risk of difficult airway management in patients with OSA. Due to the large number of trials and large patient numbers, the overall quality of the body of evidence was considered to be moderate using the GRADE approach and the Oxford LOE.", "type": "Document"}

INTRAOPERATIVE MEDICATION USE IN PATIENTS WITH OSA > 2.1 Neuromuscular Blocking Agents > Rationale.\nNMBAs are commonly used to optimize intubation conditions and provide surgical relaxation for various procedures. However, residual neuromuscular blockade has been reported to occur in \u226464% of patients in postanesthesia care units. The use of NMBAs and residual neuromuscular blockade has been associated with significant postoperative respiratory complications such as hypoxemia, upper airway obstruction, and pneumonia. High doses of NMBA given during abdominal surgery were associated with an increased risk of 30-day readmission, increased length of hospital stay, and increased hospital cost. A retrospective review of a single-center database showed that patients who required tracheal intubation within the first 3 days after surgery had a significantly higher frequency of NMBA administration and reversal with neostigmine. Residual neuromuscular blockade may persist despite the administration of neostigmine reversal, especially when neuromuscular monitoring is not utilized. It is unclear whether patients with OSA may be at higher risk for postoperative respiratory complications due to the adverse effects of postoperative residual neuromuscular blockade compared to patients without OSA. Moreover, it is uncertain whether the type of reversal agent impacts the risk of postoperative complications in patients with OSA. Patients with suspected or confirmed OSA have been shown to be at increased risk for early postoperative respiratory complications, including emergent intubation, mechanical ventilation, noninvasive ventilation, respiratory failure, desaturation, and pneumonia. The use of NMBA was not described in these studies. Many patients with OSA are obese and have anatomical risk factors that may increase vulnerability to the effects of residual neuromuscular blockade on the upper airway and pharyngeal function. Our literature search yielded 5 studies that were heterogeneous in terms of study design, types of surgery, and types of respiratory complications. Many studies were excluded because OSA diagnosis or use of NMBA was not described. One RCT and 2 observational studies were included to address the question of whether patients with OSA are at a higher risk for postoperative respiratory complications from the use of NMBA compared to patients without OSA. Although the level of evidence was limited (Oxford LOE 2\u20133), the studies suggest that patients with OSA who received NMBA may be at increased risk of effects of residual neuromuscular blockade, postoperative respiratory failure, and hypoxemia. The results of our review are consistent with previous studies showing that patients with OSA are at higher risk of postoperative respiratory failure and hypoxemia than patients without OSA. Even partial residual neuromuscular blockade that does not evoke respiratory symptoms can impair upper airway dilator muscle function. Minimizing the use and dose of NMBA, monitoring the level of neuromuscular blockade, and complete reversal of NMBA before extubation may be particularly important for patients with OSA. While not considering OSA status, reversal of NMBA with sugammadex, a cyclodextrin used to reverse rocuronium, has been shown to decrease the incidence of residual paralysis compared to the anticholinesterase inhibitor, neostigmine. A recent Cochrane review of 41 studies comparing sugammadex with neostigmine concluded that patients receiving sugammadex versus neostigmine had 40% fewer composite adverse events (bradycardia, postoperative nausea and vomiting, and residual neuromuscular blockade). Patients receiving sugammadex had less desaturation and need for transitory oxygen supplementation; however, the OSA status was not reported in these reviews, limiting its value to assess its differential effect in this subpopulation. There are limited studies comparing the impact of different neuromuscular blocking reversal agents on postoperative respiratory complications in patients with OSA. We identified 1 RCT and 1 observational study that compared sugammadex to neostigmine. In the 2 studies, 209 patients with OSA and 185 patients without OSA were included. The RCT (n = 74) found that patients receiving sugammadex versus neostigmine had less postoperative respiratory complications (desaturation, hypoxemia, apnea, airway manipulation, airway usage, reintubation, continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP] therapy, and invasive mechanical ventilation). There was no difference in airway obstruction. The observational study (n = 320) compared sugammadex to a historical cohort of patients who received neostigmine reversal for laparoscopic bariatric surgeries. Patients with OSA who received sugammadex versus neostigmine had less postoperative chest radiographic changes (atelectasis, pleural effusions), 6.9% vs 16.3% (odds ratio [OR], 0.36; 95% CI, 0.18\u20130.8), but there were no differences in postoperative mechanical ventilation or hospital length of stay. Although both studies showed a reduction in some postoperative respiratory complications, the evidence is limited because the number of patients included in the RCT (Oxford LOE: 2) was small, and the observational study (Oxford LOE: 3) reported no difference in clinical outcomes. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of sugammadex over neostigmine to reduce the risk of postoperative respiratory complications in patients with OSA. More trials with larger sample sizes are needed in this patient population.", "type": "Document"}

INTRAOPERATIVE MEDICATION USE IN PATIENTS WITH OSA > 2.2 Opioids > Rationale.\nWhile opioids are highly effective in treating moderate to severe pain, their intrinsic capacity to suppress ventilatory drive demands caution in OSA. Despite consensus among perioperative physicians to restrict or avoid opioids in OSA, the presence of robust, high-quality scientific evidence to demonstrate the merit of heightened concern and guide safe opioid practice in this population is limited. Nevertheless, despite limitations with respect to the quality of evidence suggesting an adverse impact of acute opioid administration in OSA, current literature indicates that a heightened concern regarding opioid use in this population may be justified. A summary of evidence is provided in Supplemental Digital Content, Table A2, http://links.lww.com/AA/C373. Specifically, 17 observational studies exploring the impact of systemic opioid use in OSA were identified. While the majority demonstrated an association between opioid use and adverse perioperative outcomes in OSA, this was not confirmed by all. It should be noted that, particularly among observational analyses, there is notable heterogeneity with regard to the modality of OSA assessment, ranging from the gold standard of polysomnography to identification by screening questionnaires or patient history. Furthermore, potential selection bias should be considered in these studies. In recent publications, a comparison of postoperative complications among patients with and without OSA within the same study cohort revealed that the incidence of postoperative pulmonary (2.49% vs 1.83%), cardiac (2.81% vs 0.23%), gastrointestinal (0.45% vs 0.33%), renal (3.47% vs 1.83%), and thromboembolic (0.41% vs 0.33%) complications was higher in patients with OSA at similar opioid dose levels. Additional analysis of the impact of opioid dose increase within patients with OSA demonstrated an associated increase in the odds for gastrointestinal complications, prolonged length of stay, and increased hospital cost, while no further increase in risk for pulmonary complications was observed, possibly due to increased levels of monitoring afforded to this population. A higher incidence of postoperative complications in OSA versus non-OSA in this context was also found by Blake et al and Esclamado et al, while the latter conducted their study in upper airway surgery, a procedure with a potentially inherent influence on respiratory outcome. Chung et al demonstrated an opioid dose-dependent postoperative worsening of sleep-disordered breathing associated with the severity of OSA (expressed by AHI), although this effect may have been fairly small. Male patients with OSA had a significantly higher central apnea index on postoperative night 1 versus female patients with OSA. In this context, numerous other observational studies took a different approach by investigating the occurrence of critical, life-threatening respiratory events, such as respiratory failure and naloxone requirement and identifying drivers for these complications. Moreover, a recent systematic review reported that the majority of surgical patients with OSA experiencing perioperative death or near-death events received a morphine equivalent dose of <10 mg/d. Subramani et al suggested that a dose-response pattern with increased odds for complications at increasing opioid dose levels (ORs of 1.0, 1.5, and 3.0 at opioid doses of <10, 10\u201325, and >25 mg; P for trend <.005) exists. In contrast, others who restricted their focus to patients with obesity, a population of high OSA prevalence, demonstrated that, although postoperative respiratory complications in the context of opioid analgesia were common, surprisingly, OSA could not be established as an independent risk factor. However, a factor potentially causing an underestimation of a possible deleterious effect of OSA was the postoperative use of positive airway pressure therapy among patients with OSA. Moreover, a proof of concept analysis by Wang et al suggested that the experimental oral administration of 30 mg controlled-release morphine in 10 volunteers outside the surgical setting paradoxically improved oxygenation through modulating chemoreflexes. In summary, evidence from observational analyses suggests that opioid use in the presence of OSA presents a risk factor for postoperative critical respiratory events (Oxford LOE 3\u20134). With regard to evidence from RCTs, 6 such studies were identified (Oxford LOE 2). In a volunteer study, Bernards et al directly demonstrated that opioid administration during sleep increased the number of central apneas, leading to decreased saturation levels in patients with OSA versus those without OSA. Abdelmageed et al demonstrated that opioid dose reduction significantly reduced the incidence of central apneas and respiratory events in patients with OSA. While interesting, it must be noted that opioid reduction may decrease respiratory depression and related complications in the general population as well. Using a nonvalidated OSA prediction instrument, Blake et al showed that central apneas and respiratory events were related to the dose of morphine administered postoperatively. However, differences in the occurrence of respiratory complications between patients with standard morphine patient-controlled analgesia and an opioid-sparing regimen could not be established. Other studies explored the safety of neuraxial opioid administration in patients with OSA. In a systematic review, Orlov et al found that the incidence of major cardiorespiratory complications after neuraxial opioid administrations was 4.1% among patients with OSA. However, the authors also emphasized that significant limitations in the quality of evidence and persistent underreporting of adverse events prevented an accurate and robust assessment of true perioperative risk. A prospective study in patients having a cesarean delivery with intrathecal morphine administration demonstrated that OSA and obesity were associated with approximately a 2-fold increase in risk for desaturation. However, another observational analysis of 990 patients undergoing orthopedic surgery with intrathecal morphine could not find an association between OSA and adverse pulmonary events. In summary, limited literature suggests that patients with OSA may be at increased risk for opioid-related respiratory adverse events. However, high-quality evidence to support and prove this notion is largely lacking (Oxford LOE 2\u20134).", "type": "Document"}

INTRAOPERATIVE MEDICATION USE IN PATIENTS WITH OSA > 2.2 Opioids > Pain and Opioid Analgesia in OSA.\nA systematic evaluation of opioid-related respiratory effects in OSA requires focused attention on closely related issues such as pain perception and pharmacology of opioid analgesia. A summary of evidence is provided in Supplemental Digital Content, Table A3, http://links.lww.com/AA/C373 (Oxford LOE 3). Characterizing these relationships is important because the dose of opioids that is required to treat pain, as well as the sensitivity to these medications, directly influence the likelihood of opioid-induced respiratory depression. Disturbed sleep continuity and intermittent hypoxia are 2 important features of OSA. Studies in humans have repeatedly demonstrated that fragmented or chronically curtailed sleep and insomnia, a condition highly comorbid with OSA, are associated with heightened sensitivity to pain. Among 3 identified studies examining the response to experimental pain in subjects suffering from OSA, 1 study found that patients with OSA and comorbid temporomandibular joint disorder experienced hypoalgesia to pressure-related pain, while another reported a significant increase in pain threshold after restoring sleep continuity with the application of CPAP therapy. In contrast, the third investigation found no association between wake-after-sleep-onset or nocturnal nadir blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) polysomnographic parameters and threshold/tolerance to thermal pain. In the context of chronic pain, a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from the Cleveland Family Study showed that chronic intermittent hypoxia was associated with more frequent chronic pain complaints, even after adjusting for the potentially hyperalgesic effect of sleep fragmentation and systemic inflammation. Despite the primary goal to focus on the adult patient population in this guideline, a significant amount of evidence originates from the pediatric population and deserves mention here particularly because they show contradictory findings to those found among adults. In children undergoing adenotonsillectomy for treatment of OSA, 2 case\u2013control studies, 1 retrospective and 1 prospective, showed that patients with a preoperative nocturnal nadir SpO2 <85% required half the dose of morphine to treat postoperative pain, versus those with a nadir SpO2 \u226585%. Two prospective case\u2013control studies in the same population did not confirm these findings. In the first study, African American children versus Caucasian children with OSA presented with more pain requiring a higher dose of morphine for postoperative analgesia. The second study showed that children with OSA (respiratory disturbance index >5) required more morphine for postoperative analgesia, but they also demonstrated a higher incidence of opioid-related respiratory complications. In adults, 1 retrospective analysis found that bariatric patients with nocturnal hypoxemia (expressed as percentage of total sleep time spent at oxygen saturation [SaO2] <90%) required less opioids for postoperative analgesia, whereas another prospective study did not detect any association between preoperative nocturnal hypoxemia and postoperative opioid use in general surgical patients with OSA. A more detailed and comprehensive summary of evidence on the potential impact of acute opioid analgesia in OSA is provided in a separate systematic review by the SASM opioids focus group (members listed in the acknowledgments).", "type": "Document"}

INTRAOPERATIVE MEDICATION USE IN PATIENTS WITH OSA > 2.3 Propofol > Rationale.\nThe literature discussed for the purpose of the recommendation reflects evidence of importance for patients receiving propofol for sedation in a procedural setting, that is, drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE), gastroenterological endoscopy, or dentistry. The use of propofol to induce general anesthesia purposefully suppresses respiratory activity and was thus deferred in this section. Propofol is the most commonly used agent for DISE. A summary of findings from 5 studies is shown in Supplemental Digital Content, Table A4, http://links.lww.com/AA/C373 (Oxford LOE: 2\u20134). Both body mass index (BMI) and severity of OSA correlated with a greater likelihood of a patient having multiple sites of airway collapse and a higher possibility of circumferential and total airway obstruction during DISE. The goal of propofol administration for DISE is to produce a sleep-like loss of consciousness and muscle relaxation to precipitate pharyngeal narrowing and collapse in vulnerable individuals. To avoid the problem of profound relaxation or central apnea, it has been suggested that initial dosing for DISE be judiciously titrated. Attempts have been made to formulate a mathematical equation to model the pharmacokinetics for propofol in patients with obesity (Supplemental Digital Content, Table A5, http://links.lww.com/AA/C373). Uncertainty regarding dosing scalar adjustments that may be required in patients with obesity, as well as the concomitant use of depressant drugs with synergistic effects (midazolam, ketamine, dexmedetomidine, opioids), further add to the need for heightened vigilance when using propofol for patients with OSA. Propofol has a relatively steep dose-response curve compared to other sedatives/hypnotics, thus underscoring the importance of careful titration. Adverse effects are not uncommon in patients with OSA undergoing procedures with propofol sedation. A summary of findings from 5 studies is shown in Supplemental Digital Content, Table A6, http://links.lww.com/AA/C373. OSA, increased BMI, male gender, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status \u2265III, initial dose of propofol, and increased age were found to be independent risk factors for hypoxemic incidents. Airway interventions were common in patients receiving propofol, although indications for airway intervention were left to the discretion of the anesthesia provider. Whether precautionary or subsequent to an obstructed airway, apneic, or desaturation episode, such airway interventions were undoubtedly done to prevent or mitigate a sedation-related adverse event. The use of capnography was associated with a decreased incidence of hypoxic events compared to standard monitoring alone during sedation with propofol in patients with OSA.", "type": "Document"}

INTRAOPERATIVE MEDICATION USE IN PATIENTS WITH OSA > 2.4 Inhalational Agents > Rationale.\nThere is a lack of scientific literature to guide best intraoperative practices in OSA regarding the preferred technique among various inhalational agents and intravenous propofol for the maintenance of anesthesia. Nevertheless, a significant amount of evidence has been published on the general population and patients with obesity. Evidence from the population with obesity may merit consideration in this context, given the close association to OSA, reflected in the substantial OSA prevalence of \u226490% in male bariatric patients. Notably, there is significant overlap between obesity and OSA with regard to challenges in general anesthesia because of altered cardiorespiratory physiology, including decreased functional residual capacity, upper airway obstruction, and the propensity to hypoxemia in perioperative settings. This renders the period of emergence and recovery from anesthesia of high concern regarding the risk for detrimental outcomes. In this context, 25 studies were identified that compared the efficacy and recovery profile among the most common inhalational agents and intravenous propofol. A summary of evidence is provided in Supplemental Digital Content, Tables A7 and A8, http://links.lww.com/AA/C373. Comparing propofol and isoflurane, propofol was suggested to be associated with a faster recovery from anesthesia and improved postoperative respiratory control in 2 RCTs. However, sevoflurane was found to be superior to propofol in 2 RCTs due to faster anesthesia recovery and improved hemodynamic stability. In addition, recently Fassbender et al reported no difference with regard to postoperative obstructive and hypoxemic events between the 2 anesthetic agents when combined with remifentanil. Furthermore, comparing propofol and desflurane, 1 study demonstrated that the use of propofol impaired pulmonary function and SpO2 to a greater degree than desflurane, while another could not confirm these differences. Thus, current evidence indicates that sevoflurane and desflurane might be superior to intravenous propofol in terms of anesthesia recovery in patients with obesity (Oxford LOE: 2). Similarly, 4 RCTs conducted in the population with obesity supported the notion that sevoflurane was associated with favorable features compared to isoflurane. In particular, Sudr\u00e9 et al demonstrated that sevoflurane embedded in a short-acting anesthetic regimen comprised of remifentanil, rocuronium, and ropivacaine improved emergence from anesthesia and reduced respiratory complications, postoperative anesthesia care unit stay, and hospital length of stay when compared to isoflurane within a long-acting regimen. This analysis emphasized the plausible benefit of generally utilizing short-acting medications with regard to all anesthetic drug classes, including opioids and NMBA, among patients at higher perioperative risk. The majority of studies, however, focused on the comparative effectiveness between sevoflurane and desflurane, demonstrating improved anesthesia recovery with desflurane (Oxford LOE: 2). Notably, limitations inherent to the nature of these comparisons can prevent the detection of differences. For instance, Eger and Shafer showed that differences in postoperative wake-up times among anesthetics were minimal at lower anesthetic concentrations, while the duration of anesthesia and BMI present important covariates. Summarizing the evidence, a well-designed systematic review by Liu et al provided a comprehensive comparison with quantitative analysis of immediate postoperative recovery after desflurane, isoflurane, sevoflurane, and intravenous propofol anesthesia in patients with obesity. In addition, a rather small clinical trial by Juvin et al also compared desflurane, isoflurane, and propofol together in 1 analysis. Both Liu et al and Juvin et al established desflurane as the most favorable anesthetic agent because of its superior postoperative recovery profile. Specifically, it was observed that patients who received desflurane anesthesia required less time to respond to commands, eye opening, hand squeezing, tracheal extubation, and name stating. Moreover, desflurane reduced sedation levels and conferred higher postoperative SpO2. It appears, therefore, that postoperative recovery might occur faster and with improved hemodynamic stability after anesthesia with desflurane followed by sevoflurane (Supplemental Digital Content, Table A7, http://links.lww.com/AA/C373), and these findings have also been observed in the general population. Consistently, desflurane and sevoflurane feature low blood-gas partition coefficients, conferring greater intraoperative control of anesthesia depth, as well as rapid and consistent postoperative emergence and recovery. These properties, in turn, imply earlier achievement of baseline respiratory function with potentially better protection against aspiration and improved oxygenation. This has also been supported by the observation of decreases in hypoxemia in clinical trials. Both obesity and OSA predispose patients to higher risk of postoperative upper airway obstruction and serious hypoxemia, thus suggesting a benefit associated with early and rapid recovery of active airway control and alertness. Another intervention, possibly promoting increased safety in OSA, is the intraoperative monitoring of anesthesia depth. This has been suggested by Ibraheim et al and Freo et al, who demonstrated that monitoring for titration of levels of inhalational agents reduced the required anesthetic dosage and improved the postanesthetic recovery in patients with obesity. Furthermore, Katznelson et al suggested that recovery time after general anesthesia in patients with and without obesity can be accelerated using either isocapnic or hypercapnic hyperpnea. In summary, the available evidence supports the use of desflurane and sevoflurane in patients with obesity (Oxford LOE: 2). Given the strong association between obesity and OSA, and the benefits of accelerating and improving postoperative anesthesia recovery, these outcomes are desirable and may apply to patients with OSA as well. However, except for 2 RCTs, no studies specifically in OSA are available, and thus no specific recommendations can be made.", "type": "Document"}

Ketamine has mostly been studied with respect to its potent analgesic effects as a sedative and hypnotic and, more recently, to reduce opioid use. There are only a few studies involving ketamine use in patients with OSA, but data are insufficient to draw any firm conclusions. Adverse effects of ketamine, such as neuropsychiatric effects, signs of increased sympathetic system activation (hypertension and tachycardia), and hypersalivation, are well documented in patients without OSA. Although patients with OSA are not specifically studied, these adverse events most likely translate to increased risk in this patient population as well. Adverse events are mostly seen in patients who received high doses, meaning >0.5 mg/kg boluses and 100 \u00b5g/kg/h infusions. Ketamine has been shown to have some beneficial effects. Studies demonstrated that ketamine, when combined with other sedative medications, mostly propofol, may decrease respiratory-related adverse effects. One such prospective observational study looking at sedation-related risk factors (airway obstruction, hypoventilation, and desaturation) for procedural sedation found ketamine to be a protective factor. De Oliveira et al reported that ketamine decreased duration and severity of hypercapnia in patients undergoing breast surgery under deep sedation. Furthermore, Drummond studied the effect of ketamine versus midazolam on upper airway function. Interestingly, they found decreased upper airway muscle activity in the midazolam group, which resulted in airway obstruction, whereas no change in muscle activity was observed in the ketamine group. In another study, genioglossus muscle activity, tidal volume, and respiratory rate have been shown to be increased after administration of high and low doses of ketamine in rats. Upper airway dilator muscle activity plays an important role in patients who are at risk of upper airway obstruction. Despite the lack of data on ketamine in the patient population with OSA, available information suggests that these patients could benefit from potentially favorable respiratory effects over other sedatives.

INTRAOPERATIVE MEDICATION USE IN PATIENTS WITH OSA > 2.6 Benzodiazepines > Rationale.\nAlthough the literature is immature on the topic of differential effects of intravenous benzodiazepine sedation in patients with OSA compared to those without OSA, studies suggest that the use of intravenous benzodiazepines is associated with airway compromise in patients with OSA. Intravenous benzodiazepine sedation is routinely used to induce airway collapse for diagnostic purposes in OSA. Much of the literature revolves around the use of intravenous benzodiazepines for DISE in a diagnostic context to examine locations and patterns of obstruction in patients with OSA. Midazolam is the most commonly used intravenous benzodiazepine for DISE. In 7 studies, the majority of patients had multilevel obstruction, especially those with higher AHI. Two studies evaluated sleep staging during midazolam-induced sleep. The first showed that patients spent the most time in nonrapid eye movement sleep stage N1 and N2 but not in stage N3 and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. The second reported that patients reached N2 sleep without further deepening of sleep stage. Because most obstructive events occur in N1 and N2 sleep, DISE with intravenous midazolam is considered a good option to study obstructive events in patients with OSA. Interestingly, Sadaoka et al found that patients with OSA had oxygen desaturation and apneas during DISE with intravenous diazepam more frequently than simple snorers. Another category of studies described the use of intravenous benzodiazepines for sleep imaging. Thus, a retrospective analysis by Lee et al compared 53 patients with OSA to 10 simple snorers. All patients with OSA had desaturation events after 2 mg of midazolam, but none in the simple snorers group had such events. We identified 5 studies evaluating intravenous benzodiazepines in the context of other endoscopic or surgical procedures. Midazolam was used either alone or in combination with fentanyl. One study did not specify which benzodiazepines were used. Three studies compared outcomes between patients with and without OSA. In a retrospective cohort study by Adler et al, 215 patients undergoing routine endoscopy were randomized to 4 groups: patients with OSA undergoing endoscopy with propofol or midazolam + fentanyl and patients without OSA undergoing endoscopy with propofol or midazolam + fentanyl. A comparison of patients with and without OSA receiving midazolam and fentanyl showed that desaturation events and other complications were not significantly different. Notably, doses of midazolam and fentanyl needed for colonoscopy were slightly lower in patients with OSA, although the procedure time was moderately longer. Cha et al published a prospective study that compared cardiopulmonary complications during routine esophagogastroduodenoscopy under sedation with midazolam between 31 patients with OSA and 65 healthy controls. Patients with OSA received a higher dose of midazolam than patients without OSA, but cardiopulmonary complications were not increased in patients with OSA. Mador et al conducted a prospective study in 904 patients undergoing endoscopy to investigate whether OSA, assessed by the Berlin questionnaire, increases the risk of complications during sedation with midazolam and fentanyl. Major complications were observed in 3.25% of patients with low risk for OSA and in 1.9% of patients with high risk for OSA (OR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.26\u20131.46; P = .21). Minor complications were observed in 10.56% of patients with low OSA risk and 10.63% of patients with high OSA risk (OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.65\u20131.56; P = 1.0), suggesting that OSA was not associated with increased risk for cardiopulmonary complications during endoscopy under sedation with midazolam and fentanyl in this analysis. In conclusion, 5 studies directly compared outcomes between patients with and without OSA after intravenous benzodiazepine sedation in the context of anesthesia. However, only 2 studies were able to establish a higher risk for respiratory complications in patients with OSA (Oxford LOE: 3).

INTRAOPERATIVE MEDICATION USE IN PATIENTS WITH OSA > 2.7 \u03b1-2 Agonists > Rationale.\nDexmedetomidine and clonidine are centrally acting \u03b1-2 agonists with sedative, analgesic, and sympatholytic properties. Dexmedetomidine, in particular, has been suggested to cause minimal respiratory depression. Because OSA is associated with an increased risk of adverse postoperative pulmonary events, the potentially favorable respiratory profile and analgesic-sparing effects theoretically make \u03b1-2 agonists appealing for this population. When assessing the risk of adverse events with the use of \u03b1-2 agonists, no eligible studies compared patients with OSA to patients without OSA. The majority of studies focused on OSA or bariatric populations, comparing the use of \u03b1-2 agonists to either placebo or other medications. The body of literature is limited by a small total number of subjects, inconsistent results, lack of uniformity in outcomes, and low adverse event rates. Although many studies demonstrate statistical differences in hemodynamic parameters with \u03b1-2 agonists, the translation into clinically meaningful outcome differences is not supported at this time. Four studies compared the use of dexmedetomidine to propofol in DISE as summarized in Supplemental Digital Content, Table A10, http://links.lww.com/AA/C373 (propofol in DISE has also been discussed in Section 2.3). In a series by Capasso et al, patients receiving propofol had a significantly increased likelihood of complete tongue base obstruction versus partial or no obstruction compared to those receiving dexmedetomidine. The 2 other studies that examined aspects of airway obstruction did not demonstrate significant differences between the dexmedetomidine and comparison groups. Three DISE studies measured intraprocedural respiratory and hemodynamic parameters. Two studies demonstrated a decrease in respiratory rate and lower SpO2 with propofol compared to dexmedetomidine. In the study by Cho et al, mean SpO2 of the dexmedetomidine-remifentanil and propofol groups did not differ; however, it was significantly lower in the propofol-remifentanil group. This study showed no hemodynamic differences, a finding shared by Kuyrukluyildiz et al. Conversely, Yoon et al observed similar mean arterial pressure (MAP) but lower mean heart rate (HR) with dexmedetomidine and no episodes of clinically significant bradycardia. Kuyrukluyildiz et al measured postprocedure outcomes, finding significantly lower MAP and HR with dexmedetomidine. Mean SpO2 and respiratory rate were higher with dexmedetomidine, although only 1 patient receiving propofol required additional oxygen supplementation. These 4 studies were examined in a systematic review, which concluded that dexmedetomidine appeared to yield a more stable cardiopulmonary profile, while propofol offered a faster onset, a shorter half-life, and potentially a greater degree of airway obstruction. The authors emphasized that neither propofol nor dexmedetomidine has been validated in replicating the obstruction that occurs during sleep. The obstructive patterns could be due to drug effect rather than reflective of the natural sleep state. Consequently, additional investigation is necessary to ascertain the optimal sedative in DISE.", "type": "Document"}

INTRAOPERATIVE MEDICATION USE IN PATIENTS WITH OSA > 2.7 \u03b1-2 Agonists > Other Procedures.\nFor studies involving procedures other than DISE, adverse events were characterized according to respiratory effects, hemodynamic effects, and recovery profile (Supplemental Digital Content, Table A11, http://links.lww.com/AA/C373). Two studies reported respiratory outcomes during sedation procedures. In a descriptive series of 20 patients at high risk of OSA, 13 required interventions for airway obstruction and 2 for desaturation during endoscopy with combined dexmedetomidine\u2013propofol sedation. An RCT in upper respiratory procedures demonstrated that, compared to propofol target-controlled infusion, dexmedetomidine use resulted in lower desaturation incidence, higher SpO2 at most time points, and lower rates of airway obstruction. Data are limited regarding respiratory effects of dexmedetomidine in the postoperative recovery period. A descriptive series of bariatric patients reported adequate saturations with supplemental oxygen without the need for CPAP. Studies with quantitative data suggest that intraoperative use of dexmedetomidine may not affect the respiratory rate in bariatric patients and when compared to placebo may have a better recovery profile in individuals undergoing uvuloplasty. In another group of patients receiving postoperative sedation after uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, the dexmedetomidine group experienced less severe and less frequent cough during extubation and less respiratory depression compared to the propofol group. Finally, in a retrospective review comparing patients undergoing airway reconstruction surgery who received dexmedetomidine versus those who did not, neither group required interventions for airway compromise. Two studies examined the effect of clonidine on respiratory parameters and sleep in patients with OSA. In an RCT of 8 patients, clonidine compared to placebo suppressed the amount of time in REM sleep and decreased apnea duration during REM while not affecting overall AHI. Minimum SpO2 levels were higher in the clonidine group (86% \u00b1 1.5% vs 84% \u00b1 1.0%), reaching statistical but arguably not clinical significance. Pawlik et al performed an RCT in patients with OSA undergoing ear, nose, and throat surgery, with patients receiving either oral clonidine or placebo the night before and 2 hours before surgery. AHI in the night of surgery did not differ from baseline or between the 2 treatment groups. In both groups, the desaturation index decreased on the preoperative night, the day of the operation, and the postoperative night compared to their respective baseline measurements but did not differ between groups. The hemodynamic effects of \u03b1-2 agonists were assessed according to varied outcome measures, including vital sign measurements, categorical descriptors, and need for rescue medications. Intraoperatively, 3 studies demonstrated significantly lower MAPs with \u03b1-2 agonists, while 1 study showed no difference. Heart rate was significantly lower with dexmedetomidine in 3 studies, while no difference to controls was observed in 2 other studies. Chawla et al reported transient loading dose hypertension followed by \u201ctitratable, controlled hypotension, and bradycardia.\u201d Three studies demonstrated less frequent use of rescue antihypertensives or \u03b2 blockers among \u03b1-2 agonist groups intraoperatively; 1 study showed this postoperatively. Furthermore, 1 study demonstrated a greater incidence of need for phenylephrine support in patients receiving dexmedetomidine. In studies reporting the need for atropine and/or ephedrine, the overall incidence was low, and no differences were reported between treatment groups. Among studies that measured postoperative hemodynamics, there was inconsistency as to whether MAP was decreased with \u03b1-2 agonists or similar to that of the control patients. Xu et al also characterized outcomes according to categorical variables and found a decreased incidence of hypertension and tachycardia, as well as an increased incidence of bradycardia in the dexmedetomidine-treated group; the frequency of hypotension did not differ. The potential role of \u03b1-2 agonists in modulating the sympathetic response is of clinical interest. Four studies examined the effects of \u03b1-2 agonists on hemodynamics at points of stimulation, such as intubation, incision, and extubation. Only 1 study compared the measurements of each group to their respective baseline values, while all compared the measurements between treatment groups. Blood pressure and HR in the \u03b1-2 agonist groups were either lower than or similar to their control groups. Another group observed less frequent spikes in MAP and HR in clonidine-treated patients, but this was not statistically significant. The effects of \u03b1-2 agonists on recovery profile varied. Three studies demonstrated shorter time to extubation with \u03b1-2 agonists, 1 showed no difference compared to control patients, and another showed increased time to extubation. One series described prolonged drowsiness with dexmedetomidine, while another study showed no difference in sedation score compared to control patients. End points related to postoperative nausea/vomiting were examined in 1 observational study and 3 RCTs. In summary, the literature on the differential effect of \u03b1-2-agonists in patients with and without OSA is limited and results are nonuniform (Oxford LOE: 2\u20134). While a trend in statistical outcomes for some cardiorespiratory parameters may be observed, the clinical impact of these findings remains unknown.", "type": "Document"}

ANESTHESIA TECHNIQUE > Rationale > Anesthesia Technique as a Modifier of Postoperative Outcome.\nWith regard to comparative effectiveness between general and regional anesthesia specifically in patients with OSA, 6 observational studies were identified. A summary of evidence is provided in Supplemental Digital Content, Table A12, http://links.lww.com/AA/C373. Overall, studies indicated that the utilization of regional as opposed to general anesthesia would improve postoperative outcome. The largest population-based analysis included >30,000 patients with OSA from >400 US hospitals undergoing joint arthroplasty procedures. Adjusted risk of numerous major complications was significantly lower in patients with OSA who received neuraxial anesthesia versus general anesthesia. Furthermore, the addition of neuraxial to general anesthesia versus the use of general anesthesia alone was associated with improved outcome profiles. Additionally, the utilization of peripheral nerve blocks was associated with decreased odds for mechanical ventilation, critical care admissions, and prolonged hospital length of stay. Subsequent studies confirmed the previous findings, while 1 suggested benefits with regard to mortality. Notably, in a prospective analysis investigating drivers of postoperative worsening of sleep-disordered breathing, Chung et al demonstrated that the utilization of general anesthesia was associated with an increased central apnea index postoperatively, while 72-hour total opioid dose was a driver of increased AHI. This finding suggests that the residual effects of general anesthesia may affect postoperative sleep architecture and sleep-disordered breathing in OSA. Given the necessity of airway manipulation under general anesthesia, other challenges inherent to OSA should be considered as well. The higher risk for a difficult airway in OSA has been discussed in Section 1. However, challenges with regard to airway complications in patients with OSA appear to also extend to the time for emergence from anesthesia and the immediate postoperative period, potentially leading to the requirement of emergent airway interventions. Thus, consistent with the underlying pathogenesis of OSA, perioperative complications in these patients may be driven by upper airway obstruction. Recently, Ramachandran et al showed that OSA was an independent predictor of respiratory complications and unplanned intubation after general anesthesia. Another potential hazard associated with the use of general anesthesia is the frequent need for neuromuscular blockade. As described in Section 2.1, studies suggest that patients with OSA who received NMDA may be at increased risk for effects of residual neuromuscular blockade and respiratory failure compared to the general population. Therefore, the use of regional anesthesia may offer advantages by virtue of avoiding upper airway effects, although the potential for the need to convert to general anesthesia should always be considered. Neural stimulation appears to be essential in initiating the surgical catabolic stress response, and regional anesthesia utilizing local anesthetics seems to reliably block this effect. Given the evidence suggesting potential OSA-related alterations in pain perception and opioid potency due to intermittent hypoxia and sleep fragmentation, as discussed in Section 2.2, regional anesthesia confers benefits by providing effective pain relief while reducing opioid requirement, a key factor to consider in patients with OSA. In summary, despite the lack of high-quality RCTs, some evidence suggests a higher risk of complications with general compared to regional anesthesia in patients with OSA (Oxford LOE 2\u20134). Thus, regional anesthesia should be considered by anesthesiologists whenever feasible.", "type": "Document"}

Adequate difficult airway management precautions should be taken in patients with OSA.Anesthetic and analgesic drugs can interact with or impact consciousness, sleep, upper airway anatomy and physiology, arousal responses, muscle activation, and ventilatory drive, potentially increasing perioperative risk in patients with OSA.In patients with OSA, the utilization of NMBA may confer an increased risk for the effects of residual neuromuscular blockade, postoperative respiratory failure, or hypoxemia. Residual neuromuscular blockade could be a driver of the higher incidence of respiratory complications in OSA. While neuromuscular blocking reversal agents can decrease postoperative residual paralysis and respiratory complications, current evidence does not favor any specific neuromuscular reversal agent with regard to outcome.Given the respiratory depressant effects of opioids, patients with OSA may be at increased risk for respiratory complications from the use of these analgesic drugs. Furthermore, chronic intermittent hypoxia and habitual sleep fragmentation may increase pain perception and augment opioid potency in OSA. These factors should be considered when administering opioids to patients with OSA.Patients with OSA receiving propofol for procedural sedation may be at increased risk for respiratory compromise and hypoxemic events. In the absence of certainty regarding dosing and scalar adjustments to concomitant use of other drugs and potential concurrent obesity, the utilization of propofol sedation in OSA requires a heightened level of vigilance as well as careful monitoring and titration to achieve desired effects.There is a lack of evidence on residual effects and anesthesia recovery profiles of inhalational agents and intravenous propofol specifically for the population with OSA. However, evidence in patients with obesity, a population with a high prevalence of OSA, indicates a potential superiority of sevoflurane and desflurane compared to intravenous propofol with regard to emergence and recovery from anesthesia. Comparing sevoflurane and desflurane, the latter has been associated with improved anesthesia recovery in patients with obesity.Evidence on the impact of ketamine specifically in OSA is largely lacking; however, adverse events such as psychiatric effects, sympathetic system activation, and hypersalivation, as usually observed in the general population during utilization of high doses, likely translate to OSA as well. Notably, however, emerging evidence indicates a potentially favorable impact of ketamine over other sedatives with regard to preservation of upper airway and ventilatory function.Despite the scarcity of data on the comparative effectiveness of intravenous benzodiazepine sedation among patients with and without OSA, intravenous benzodiazepines are known to and are purposefully utilized to induce upper airway collapse for diagnostic purposes of OSA. Thus, the procedure of intravenous benzodiazepine sedation may be associated with airway compromise in OSA.The potentially favorable respiratory profile and analgesic-sparing effects of \u03b1-2 agonists may render these drugs beneficial to the population with OSA. However, current literature on the effect of \u03b1-2 agonists in patients with OSA is limited and provides heterogeneous results. Thus, despite the detection of trends in statistical outcomes for some cardiorespiratory parameters, the clinical relevance of these findings remains unclear.Evidence on the comparative effectiveness of general versus regional anesthesia in the context of OSA is sparse. Nevertheless, the limited evidence in patients with OSA indicates a higher risk of complications with general compared to regional anesthesia. When feasible, regional anesthesia may confer advantages such as avoidance of upper airway effects and neuromuscular blockade, effective pain management, reduced opioid consumption, and efficient suppression of the systemic stress response. These features may be of benefit to patients with OSA. Given these findings and in the absence of evidence suggesting a disadvantage of regional anesthesia, the utilization of these techniques should be considered preferable over general anesthesia whenever feasible.

Four separate committees were formed. First, a 12-member Steering Committee was created based on clinical and scientific backgrounds, as well as an established surgical competence with BR-PDAC and LA-PDAC (Europe: 8, USA: 2, India: 1, South Australia: 1). The Steering Committee included the chairperson of the consensus conference (U.B.). This committee designated a Validation Committee consisting of 15 members (Europe: 12; USA: 2) chaired by a pancreatic surgeon familiar with the methodology (H.J.A.; USA) as well as 3 patient representatives and a Research Committee of 18 members (all from Europe) devoted to a comprehensive literature search for BR-PDAC and LA-PDAC. A large Expert Committee of 79 members (Europe: 64; USA: 7; Japan: 5; China: 3) was also created serving for the discussion at the consensus conference and the voting. Finally, a 19-member The REDISCOVER Multidisciplinary Advisory Board comprising members of medical and radiation oncology, radiology, nuclear medicine, diagnostic and interventional endoscopy, and pathology was selected to guarantee adherence to guidelines. The methodology used to establish the REDISCOVER guidelines has been previously employed in other evidence-based guidelines. Briefly, working groups of experts and researchers used the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) methodology to evaluate the evidence and create guideline recommendations. The strength of recommendation was based on the GRADE rating. The Expert Committee then used the Delphi method to reach a consensus on the recommendations, and the Validation Committee used the AGREE II-GRS tool to assess the methodological quality of the guidelines and externally validate them. The Validation Committee operated autonomously since it was not involved in developing the recommendations and was not provided with any advance notice of the precise content of the guidelines before the meeting. A total of 52 clinical questions were identified by the steering committee to be allocated to 5 working groups. Each working group consisted of 2 to 3 members of the steering committee, 1 to 2 senior researchers, and 2 to 3 junior researchers. The working groups used the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases to conduct systematic reviews of the literature for each question (the overall PRISMA flowchart is depicted in Fig. The experts of working groups developed recommendations for each clinical question based on the quality of the evidence. A GRADE rating was attached to each recommendation. The Chairman received the final recommendations from each panel. Recommendations were combined into a questionnaire and distributed to the experts for the first online vote in accordance with the Delphi process. Experts could vote on whether they agreed or disagreed with the respective recommendations in addition to providing comments. For the first online Delphi session, an agreement rate of at least 90% was required. The recommendations that did not reach that agreement were sent back to the original working group for revision. A second online Delphi voting session was held with revised recommendations (agreement rate of at least 80%). The voting process was kept confidential and anonymous. The Chairman and researcher leaders were the only persons with access to the voting rounds\u2019 results, which otherwise remained anonymous. All experts received the first and second online Delphi surveys on August 28 and September 10, 2023 An in-person meeting was held in Pisa, Italy, on September 17 and 18, 2023, during the 125th National Congress of the Italian Society of Surgery. Each working group delivered its evidence-based recommendations in a dedicated session. Following each statement, the audience used a digital voting system to indicate whether they agreed or disagreed with the proposed statement. To promote transparency and stimulate discussion, the results of the audience\u2019s final vote were displayed in a real-time manner. The Validation Committee examined the recommendations\u2019 wording and evaluated the methodology and quality of the guidelines for each topic according to the AGREE II-GRS tool. This was carried out following the presentation of the questions allocated to each working group during private Validation Committee sessions. The Validation Committee provided a report with the quality scores for every topic and recommendations for additions or deletions during the 2-day meeting. Recommendations, which had an initial audience approval percentage of <80% were revised/updated by the Validation Committee based on the discussions held by the experts in the audience and were then put to a second vote by the audience. The Chairman Committee and Expert Committee examined and approved all additional changes and recommendations.", "type": "Document"}

{"id": null, "metadata": {"source": "PMC11161250.txt", "chunk_id": 322, "char_count": 11786}, "page_content": "### DISCUSSION\nThe REDISCOVER guidelines were developed to advance the understanding, management, and science around patients with BR-PDAC and LA-PDAC. Indeed, a growing number of patients with BR-PDAC and LA-PDAC are now considered eligible for surgery after receiving successful neoadjuvant therapies. An international assessment on the management of LA-PDAC among high-volume pancreatic surgeons revealed that all surgeons are willing to undertake portal vein resection in well-selected patients, and half of them were also willing to consider artery resection. Even in the case of oligometastatic liver metastases, around one-third of the experts would accept the option of resection. Nonetheless, this survey revealed a considerable variation in clinical practice, that is largely based on the lack of prospective studies. Therefore, it was clear that there is a great need for the international community of pancreas surgeons to convene and set some universal guidelines for evidence-based practice in these patients and determine areas where further evidence and collaboration are needed. It is unrealistic to assume that the REDISCOVER guidelines could address all issues pertaining to the management and perioperative care of patients with LA-PDAC and BR-PDAC. Instead, they ought to be viewed as a first step toward an ongoing, worldwide cooperative endeavor to standardize these procedures. With this priority, we developed an online registry, which is currently available to enter cases on a large scale (https://rediscover.unipi.it/). It is expected that the international register REDISCOVER will serve as a tool for resolving some compelling issues. There is also a major need for high-quality prospective studies. The REDISCOVER recommendations are not intended to supersede or conflict with already available oncology guidelines. Instead, they seek to address a number of surgical topics not covered in these documents and offer perspectives on a number of contentious issues pertaining to the use of oncology guidelines in surgical practice. In addition to that, some new concepts that were not included in earlier guidelines\u2014such as the \u201ctest of time\u201d and arterial divestment\u2014need to be assessed in the REDISCOVER guidelines in light of the available evidence. The REDISCOVER guidelines emphasize the importance of patient selection. Preoperative systemic therapy should be delivered to all patients with or without radiation. Surgery remains the treatment end-goal option for BR-PDAC and should be taken into consideration also in well-selected patients with LA-PDAC using stringent criteria including tumor regression/stability, a significant decline in Ca 19.9 levels, and limited to patients fit for surgery. Indeed, the new paradigm of prognosis-based resectability, emphasizing biological behavior over anatomic tumor features (ie, A-B-C approach), allows expert pancreatic surgeons to prepare for vessels and pancreatic resection. With this new strategy, surgeons must be always prepared to handle unplanned vein or artery resection and reconstruction during surgery. Vascular resections and reconstructions can be performed by liver transplant or vascular surgeons following preoperative planning or upon intraoperative consultation. Appreciating that timely support of vascular and liver transplant surgeons may not always be available has led the participants of the REDISCOVER consensus conference to advise that pancreatic surgeons should achieve proficiency and independence in vascular resection and reconstruction. Resection of BR-PDAC and, especially of LA-PDAC, requires the pancreatic surgeon to have the extra technical skill not usually encountered in routine pancreatic resections. The planning of the procedure based on imaging after neoadjuvant treatments, safe vascular control, portal hypertension management, preservation of blood supply to essential organs, workflow adaptation to patient\u2019s anatomy, and patient management both before and after surgery are some of these specific technical challenges. Thus, a comprehensive reevaluation of the professional profile of pancreatic surgeons is necessary. Focused training in vascular techniques should be provided to the upcoming generation of pancreatic surgeons. A substantial body of research suggests that outcomes of pancreatic resections improve if surgery is performed in high-volume centers. Although the postoperative mortality of pancreatic resections is improved when the historical threshold of 20 pancreatoduodenectomy procedures annually is applied, it is increasingly evident that this capped annual number of operations is only the start of a global quality improvement process. Furthermore, it was made evident during the REDISCOVER consensus meeting that not all large-volume centers agree on the oncologic value of arterial resections and/or are comfortable handling peripancreatic arteries. For this reason, the REDISCOVER guidelines introduced the idea of a center of excellence for pancreatic surgery. A center of excellence provides patients with comprehensive, interdisciplinary treatment delivered by highly skilled professionals, resulting in high-quality patient outcomes. Thus, this goes well beyond just volume, although high-volume (ie, >50\u2013100 pancreatoduodenectomies/yr) is essential for this type of surgery. Recent benchmark studies demonstrated that centers operating on difficult cases offer better outcomes to all their patients, for example with lower rates of clinically relevant severe postoperative pancreatic fistula. One of the requirements for becoming a center of excellence should be to enroll patients in a prospective database or registry. The annual incidence of pancreatic resections is approximately 6 per 105 inhabitants. For BR-PDAC and LA-PDAC, the annual incidence drops to ~0.5 and 0.16 procedures per 105 inhabitants, respectively. While these figures, clearly and further, support the need for BR-PDAC and LA-PDAC to be centralized for resection, it is important to note that centralization of pancreatic resections has only occurred in a few countries. Despite the overwhelming amount of data supporting this strategy, there are a number of obstacles that prevent centralization from being widely implemented. Arterial resection is still linked to significant death rates, even in high-volume centers with an established reputation in pancreatic surgery. Therefore, the REDISCOVER guidelines cannot generally advocate arterial resections in routine practice. Surgeons who are willing to pursue arterial resection must devote a significant amount of time and resources to learning how to perform it. The learning process is not just limited to surgical skills since a comprehensive preoperative assessment and planning are critical to the success of artery resection. Unplanned artery resection is associated with higher perioperative mortality than planned resection. Some unplanned arterial resections result from iatrogenic injury while peeling off the tumor from a visceral artery (also known as arterial divestment). Therefore, while arterial divestment may be a treatment option in selected patients to spare arterial resection, while accepting a non-negligible risk of false-negative frozen section histology potentially resulting in margin positive resection, surgeons must be prepared to unexpectedly proceed with arterial resection and reconstruction. Finally, up to 60% of the patients undergoing arterial resection did not receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the era of preoperative oncology treatments. Unanticipated arterial resection accounts for some of these pancreatectomies performed beyond the current guidelines, further underscoring the need for careful patient selection and inclusion in the registry. The REDISCOVER guidelines permit the prudent pursuit of arterial resections in highly selected patients (showing involvement of the celiac trunk and/or hepatic artery, but not of the superior mesenteric artery), operated upon by skilled pancreatic surgeons in centers of excellence, provided that a multidisciplinary tumor board decides to proceed with surgery and that the results are documented in a prospective database, and from now in the registry This is based on some pilot studies that demonstrate improved outcomes. Reviews of the literature and meeting discussions brought to light a few shortcomings in the BR-PDAC and LA-PDAC definitions as they stand. First, there is just 1 category of LA-PDAC (anatomic) compared to 3 categories of BR-PDAC (A-B-C: anatomic, biological, and conditional). Second, while encasement of both the celiac trunk and the superior mesenteric artery match the current definition of LA-PDAC, the REDISCOVER guidelines accept surgery as an option only when arterial involvement is limited to the celiac trunk. Third, there is a significant amount of heterogeneity in the interpretation of anatomic data. Moreover, tumor anatomy in cross-sectional imaging may not match tumor histology following neoadjuvant treatments, and may not be able to predict the extent of local malignant involvement. Fourth, in the current era of preoperative systemic therapy and multimodality management, the anatomic definition of BR-PDAC and LA-PDAC should be reassessed by the multispecialty board after neoadjuvant therapy to consider surgical resection or not. Such a decision must be individualized to each patient by the board. This decision should incorporate the patient\u2019s response to neoadjuvant treatment, the patient\u2019s age, and baseline conditions as well as integrate anatomic and biological criteria. Finally, one important outcome of the REDISCOVER guidelines is the introduction of the concept of avoiding excessive delay in treatment initiation when a pathologic diagnosis has not been obtained after multiple attempts. In a selected group of patients who are well-informed and have an evident clinical and radiologic presentation for PDAC, starting neoadjuvant chemotherapy should be considered without the need for pretreatment tissue diagnosis. While the NCCN and ESMO guidelines both require tissue diagnosis before the administration of neoadjuvant treatments, they also recognize that, in cases where a multidisciplinary tumor board at a high-volume center agrees on the clinical diagnosis of PDAC and at least 2 biopsies failed to define a tissue diagnosis, oncology treatments may be initiated even lacking histology/cytology confirmation of PDAC. In conclusion, a group of experienced pancreas surgeons from all over the world came together at the REDISCOVER international consensus conference in an attempt to reach a consensus regarding the practical aspects of surgical therapy for patients with BR-PDAC and LA-PDAC. The REDISCOVER guidelines are only a starting point. The recommendations defined during the REDISCOVER international consensus conference should guide current pancreas surgeons and institutions on how to manage patients with BR-PDAC and LA-PDAC and guide future advances. The very low level of evidence supporting the recommendations as well as the vibrant in-person discussion demonstrate how many aspects of perioperative care are still up to individual\u2019s preference emphasizing the need for consensus and further development of evidence. The terms BR-PDAC and LA-PDAC are sometimes used interchangeably in the literature, and studies frequently incorporate data on both tumor phases, which added confusion to the topic. Perhaps, a new definition of BR-PDAC and LA-PDAC should be proposed that is less subjective in interpretation. As the development of high-quality evidence in this field will take a significant number of years, we hope that the implementation of the REDISCOVER international registry can supply some of the missing information.\n", "type": "Document"}

We registered this project as S-class 1 guidelines at the Association of the Scientific Medical Societies in Germany (http://www.awmf.org). S-class 1 guidelines are expert recommendations developed by a representative group of experts based on informal consensus without formally assessing the quality of evidence. We assumed that experts and clinicians may not necessarily consider the same topics clinically important. In May 2022, we, therefore, asked anaesthesiologists at three German university hospitals (Giessen, Hamburg, and Rostock) to submit questions on intraoperative haemodynamic monitoring and management they would expect to get answered in guidelines. The submitted questions were used to formulate 19 core questions. We discussed and answered these 19 questions (a) within groups of 2\u20133 experts and (b) within the group of all experts in two plenary meetings in September 2022 (virtual) and January 2023 (in-person).

Most have failed to sufficiently examine and objectively establish OSA as a perioperative risk factor. Moreover, few have focused on an objective assessment of how to identify patients with OSA. An example is provided by the ASA Practice Guideline for the Perioperative Management of Patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea, which was published in 2014, updating their 2006 guideline. It recommends preoperative screening to identify undiagnosed OSA, preoperative initiation of CPAP therapy for OSA where possible, and postoperative monitoring of OSA patients. However, despite best intentions, a significant dilemma occurs because these broadly based recommendations are factored on limited evidence, and the cost of implementation is high. Given this problem, a more focused and practical approach is needed to balance the desire to reduce postoperative adverse events and improve long-term health benefits with appropriate allocation of health care resources.", "type": "Document"}

In doing so, it carefully examines the existing evidence-base for preoperative screening and preparation of patients with OSA, as well as the perioperative use of CPAP in patients with diagnosed or undiagnosed OSA. The Task Force recognizes the difficulties posed by late recognition of OSA during preoperative workup, and thus, the recommendations provide a practical balance between the desire to minimize postoperative complications and the requirement for efficient use of health care resources. To enhance the value of these guidelines for treating physicians, we have categorized patients into 3 clinically relevant groups: diagnosed OSA, treated; diagnosed OSA, partially treated/untreated; and suspected OSA. The ASA 2014 guideline does not make these distinctions, thus limiting its utility in the clinical setting. It indicated \u201cCPAP should be initiated if patients have severe OSA,\u201d with no support for this statement. Our recommendations are based on a thorough evaluation of the literature, including a meta-analysis of perioperative CPAP use. In addition, as discussed later in this guideline, we recommend against delaying or canceling surgery for further workup except in particular groups of patients, with additional problems suggesting disturbed ventilation or gas exchange, such as evidence of hypoventilation, severe pulmonary hypertension, or resting hypoxemia in the absence of other diagnosed cardiopulmonary disease.

The benefits and harms of interventions and clinical practice information were considered to ensure that the recommendations preserved patient safety, clinical validity, and usefulness. The recommendation strength was classified as either \u201cstrong\u201d or \u201cweak.\u201d Recommendations were made to administer or not administer an intervention based on trade-offs between benefits on the one hand and downsides (harms, burden, and cost) on the other. A strong recommendation was given to administer an intervention or offer a treatment if the desirable effects of an outcome or an intervention clearly outweigh the undesirable effects. Conversely, if downsides outweigh benefits, the guideline will recommend against the implementation of such a treatment. If the overall effects were uncertain, a weak recommendation, also known as conditional, discretionary or qualified recommendation was given. Essentially, a weak recommendation indicates that the desirable effects of adherence probably outweigh the undesirable effects. In addition, the weak assessment rating was assigned if evidence was of low quality or evidence indicated that both desirable and undesirable effects were evenly present. Both strong and weak recommendations have a direction: either for or against. In some instances, while the level of evidence was low due to the absence of published literature, there was strong support for the statement by consensus of experts. By use of the GRADE approach, this potential dichotomy is presented for the reader to review and interpret. Recommendations may be conditional on patient values and preferences, the resources available, or the setting in which interventions will be implemented. Because resources are valued differently in the different parts of the world, it is not feasible to make judgments about the appropriateness of resource use in this guideline. Recommendations may be used at the discretion of the patient and clinician or qualified health care professional with an explanation about the issues that would lead decisions to vary.

Question: Does a Diagnosis of OSA Change Postoperative Outcomes? > Recommendation 1.1.1: Patients With a Diagnosis of OSA Should Be Considered to Be at Increased Risk for Perioperative Complications (Level of Evidence: Moderate. Grade of Recommendation: Strong for)\nThe notion that OSA negatively affects postoperative outcomes is held widely among perioperative physicians; however, prospective, controlled studies with sufficient power to support this assumption are rare, and randomization may not be feasible. In recent years, 2 independent meta-analyses have evaluated studies comparing outcomes in patients with and without a diagnosis of OSA and concluded that such a diagnosis is associated with increased risk for postoperative complications. Cardiopulmonary adverse events were increased by 2- to 3-fold. Nevertheless, these analyses used fairly strict inclusion criteria, resulting in the inclusion of 13 and 17 studies only, respectively. Additional literature available on the topic was not considered in these meta-analyses, including recent analyses generated from data collected in large national databases on millions of patients. Although the accuracy of studies that use International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) coding to identify patients with OSA in Canada has been recently criticized, the point of the critique might not be applicable to other databases, and separate validation would be necessary to verify sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, potential deficiencies of coding systems in OSA identification would label a mixture of OSA and non-OSA patients with the diagnosis of OSA, and potential misclassification would bias results to the null. Considering the fact that patients with an ICD-9 code of OSA are likely to have the disease, and many who remain undiagnosed are included in the control group as is likely the case in database studies, the associations found in these analyses could actually underestimate the true effects. The SASM Task Force on preoperative screening and assessment of patients with OSA sought to perform a comprehensive evaluation of the available information to formulate an opinion on the question: \u201cDoes the diagnosis of OSA change postoperative outcomes?\u201d This is of utmost importance because it forms the basis for clinical decision making regarding OSA in the perioperative setting and allows for the allocation of appropriate resources toward the prevention of adverse outcomes. Studies were reviewed irrespective of OSA definition and included those basing identification using ICD-9 coding, polysomnography, chart diagnosis and sleep questionnaires. Analyses that used data from population-based administrative databases were also included because these reported on large numbers of patients and are powered to investigate rare outcomes. No meta-analysis was performed, however, as the pooling of data from database studies has the possibility of case-overlap with other such investigations. The systematic review on the impact of OSA on postoperative outcomes was published by the group separately. It should be mentioned that additional studies have been published on the topic after the literature search was performed, further supporting the concept of OSA as a perioperative risk factor for complications. The literature on postoperative complications consists primarily of observational studies, and the majority of publications support the notion that the presence of OSA negatively influences perioperative outcomes. OSA may negatively affect respiratory outcomes and may be linked to postoperative cardiovascular events, such as the development of atrial fibrillation. Although speculative, commonly found comorbid conditions such as pulmonary hypertension and heart disease may contribute to these findings, suggesting that cardiac in addition to respiratory monitoring for selected patients with OSA may be considered. The literature on the association between OSA and perioperative mortality is less clear. Current data suggest an association between OSA and lower 30-day mortality. The studies reporting a reduced association of the perioperative mortality with OSA are based on population-based database analyses with residual confounding, dependence on ICD-9 diagnosis of OSA, and an inability to determine causality. It is therefore plausible that increased vigilance afforded to patients with OSA by care providers may reduce fatal outcomes as a result of complications, without influencing the latter per se. In view of ethical considerations, it is now difficult to perform randomized controlled trials in patients with OSA to determine its associations with postoperative complications, particularly in patients with severe OSA. Because of the large number of patients and the large number of trials, the overall quality of the body of evidence was considered to be moderate using the GRADE approach.", "type": "Document"}

Eleven studies based the diagnosis of OSA on ICD-9 coding, 18 used polysomnography, 6 used chart diagnoses, 16 used screening questionnaires, and 1 study referred to \u201cclinical diagnosis.\u201d In total, the included studies reported on 413 576 OSA patients (diagnosed by ICD-9 coding, polysomnography, chart or clinical diagnoses, and screening questionnaires) and 8 557 044 control (non-OSA) patients. In summary, 17 studies reported on pulmonary complications, 14 on oxygen desaturation events, 6 on difficult intubation, 11 on cardiac complications, 6 on atrial fibrillation, 11 on varying composite outcomes of minor/major complications, 19 on the utilization of resources, 4 on various other outcomes, and 13 on the outcome of mortality.

Regarding mortality, 9 of 13 studies reported no association, 3 reported lower mortality in the OSA group, and 1 study reported an increase in mortality among OSA patients. The only study reporting increased mortality was a population-based database study, which found an association between diagnosis of OSA by ICD-9 code and increased mortality in patients undergoing revision knee or hip arthroplasties.

Question: Should Adult Patients at Risk for OSA Be Identified Before Surgery? > Recommendation 2.1.1: Adult Patients at Risk for OSA Should Be Identified Before Surgery (Level of Evidence: Low, Grade of Recommendation: Weak for)\nRoutine preoperative screening for OSA in patients presenting for surgery may identify the majority of the patients with OSA and may provide opportunities for heightened awareness and potential risk reduction by implementing appropriate preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative interventions. The prevalence of patients at risk of OSA (STOP-Bang \u22653) in the surgical population is high. When compared with patients with STOP-Bang scores of 0 to 2 (low-risk OSA), surgical patients with STOP-Bang scores of \u22653 had an increased rate of perioperative complications. This may justify the use of a screening tool to risk stratify high-risk OSA patients. A screening tool may help the perioperative team to establish a strategy to reduce the risk of perioperative complications. Practice groups should consider making OSA screening part of standard preanesthetic evaluation. Although patients identified to be at high risk for OSA have been shown to have increased perioperative complications, only a small proportion of them will be affected, because the modest specificity of current screening tools means that many patients identified as \u201cat risk\u201d for OSA may not have the disease. Second, not all that do will be at increased risk beyond emergence from anesthesia because of the low-risk nature of their procedure. Third, the OSA phenotype and the severity of OSA may play an additional role. Although the ultimate goal is to minimize risk of postoperative complication as much as feasible by ensuring that every patient with suspected OSA is identified, it is clear that such an approach will result in a challenging logistical, economic, and clinical burden for healthcare providers. Hence, a balance has to be struck between the desire to minimize postoperative complications and the responsible use of resources. The realistic goal is to risk stratify those at particular risk and suggest methods to prevent or treat problems without creating undue economic burden on the health care system. There is some supporting evidence to suggest that identifying OSA in certain patient populations, such as morbidly obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery or obstetric patients with high-risk pregnancies, may be useful. Given the adverse maternal, fetal, and perioperative complications associated with OSA, prompt diagnosis and treatment of OSA is critical in the obstetric population. Although not all obstetric patients are at high risk for OSA, several prospective studies suggest that pregnant women with preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes, asthma, body mass index (BMI) \u226535 kg/m2, greater prepregnancy BMI, and excessive weight gain during pregnancy place obstetric patients at high-risk for OSA. Unfortunately, screening tools appear less accurate and have not been validated in the obstetric population, and currently, there are no pregnancy-specific guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of OSA. With the lack of evidence, the best option is to extrapolate the perioperative evaluation and management approach recommended for other patients with diagnosed or suspected OSA to the obstetric population. Fifty percent of the patients with severe obesity (BMI \u226540 kg/m2) have been found to have OSA, and 10% to 20% of these have obesity hypoventilation syndrome. Patients with a BMI \u226540 kg/m2 have increased postoperative mortality and morbidity, especially from thromboembolic, infectious, and surgical complications. The risk further increases with the presence of OSA. Those at such substantial risk may be first identified by preoperative screening, using a questionnaire such as STOP-Bang. The STOP-Bang score has been validated in both obese and morbidly obese surgical patients. A STOP-Bang score of 4 has a high sensitivity of 88% for identifying patients with severe OSA, whereas increasing the cutoff threshold score to 6 increases the specificity for severe OSA (however at a lower sensitivity). Steps to identify those likely to have OSA among morbidly obese patients are becoming accepted practice before bariatric surgery. It is important to note that, at present, there is limited evidence supporting the use of preoperative screening tools for OSA as a practice to reduce patient complications. However, the expert recommendation for preoperative screening reflects a growing consensus that identifying patients at high risk for OSA before surgery for targeted perioperative precautions and interventions may help to reduce patient complications. For example, there is evidence supporting the avoidance of general anesthesia in patients with OSA who are undergoing specific procedures such as joint arthroplasty. An important public health implication of a preoperative OSA screening program is that it could improve the long-term health of patients through better OSA treatment and a reduction of the associated consequences. It is plausible that preoperative diagnosis and optimization of patients with OSA may lead to similar benefits as those achieved by perioperative diagnosis and treatment of other chronic diseases such as coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes. Undoubtedly, further research in this area is needed, including the development of equally sensitive but more specific screening tools than those that currently exist.", "type": "Document"}

Question: Which Tools Can Be Used to Identify Surgical Patients With Suspected OSA in the Preoperative Period? > Recommendation 2.2.1: Screening Tools Such As STOP-Bang,116 P-SAP,142 Berlin,62 and ASA Check List62 Can Be Used as Preoperative Screening Tools to Identify Patients With Suspected OSA (Level of Evidence: Moderate. Grade of Recommendation: Strong for)\nThe majority of OSA patients presenting for surgery are undiagnosed and lack sufficient time before surgery to undergo formal diagnostic preoperative polysomnography testing, making screening relevant to perioperative clinical care. Previous systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and guidelines have recommended preoperative OSA screening. However, with exception of the Society for Ambulatory Anesthesia guideline, they do not provide recommendations for specific screening tests based on diagnostic accuracy. The choice of screening test is further complicated by the fact that there are many different screening approaches including questionnaires and clinical models with additional screening techniques such as upper airway imaging and overnight oximetry. Furthermore, the majority of studies investigating screening for OSA are designed around higher risk populations (eg, sleep clinic populations), and many are not validated in surgical populations. The comparative accuracy of different clinical tests for OSA has been reviewed extensively. Specific screening tools are associated with significantly greater accuracy than others, but there is a large heterogeneity within each individual screening test. This means that any given screening tool will have varying accuracy across different populations and may not have the same accuracy when implemented in clinical practice. The 2 major considerations for choosing screening tests for OSA are feasibility and reliability. Because many patients presenting for surgery may be screened on the day of or within 1 to 2 days of surgery, and some within a few weeks before surgery, the most feasible tests are questionnaires or simple clinical models. Questionnaires are the most commonly used method and have modest accuracy, whereas clinical models that incorporate symptom review with simple clinical measurements are superior to questionnaires. Implementing the search strategy on screening, the initial electronic search yielded 9565 references (S3). After screening of titles, abstracts, and manuscripts, 9562 articles were excluded. Three pertinent publications addressing the issue of screening of surgical patients for OSA with validation by laboratory polysomnography were identified. The STOP-Bang tool, P-SAP score, Berlin questionnaire, and ASA checklist are screening tests that were evaluated in the surgical population and found to have comparable accuracy (Table The STOP-Bang tool is the most validated screening tool in surgical patients and also has been validated in sleep clinic patients and the general population to detect patients at high risk of OSA. In surgical patients, a greater STOP-Bang score is associated with a greater probability of moderate-to-severe OSA. A combination of a STOP score \u2265 2 + BMI > 35 kg/m2 or male sex is associated with a greater risk of OSA. The inverse relationship between sensitivity and specificity at increasing STOP-Bang diagnostic thresholds influences the relative rates of missed diagnoses and wasted resource utilization in diagnosing OSA. It is also important to recognize that the predictive values of the tool will be lower in many preoperative settings that have lower prevalence of OSA. Despite these limitations, the updated STOP-Bang tool adds clinical value to the preoperative assessment as it provides a relatively easy method of dichotomous risk stratification of high or low risk of OSA. Other screening tools such as the P-SAP score also perform like the STOP-Bang tool when increasing the test threshold, with similar implications for missed diagnoses and resource utilization. Local practices should decide about the threshold of screening tests, after considering the implications for missed diagnoses and cost of care. The trade-off between sensitivity and specificity means that at lower thresholds, groups should expect improved sensitivity with potentially increased resource utilization, whereas increasing the threshold will result in loss of sensitivity and increased false-negative rates but improved resource utilization. A higher threshold should be adopted in the population with a lower prevalence of OSA. Because no single test has perfect sensitivity and specificity, there will be varying proportions of false positives and false negatives with any screening program. It is perhaps relevant to consider that a preoperative 12-lead electrocardiogram has <50% sensitivity for the detection of left ventricular hypertrophy and acute myocardial infarction. More advanced screening tests for OSA with greater prediction accuracy have been validated in the literature, but their complexity and applicability in the surgical population are yet to be evaluated. Currently, there is inadequate evidence in the literature to recommend the use of sleep testing such as polysomnography in the preoperative period. A future area in need of clarification regarding preoperative screening for OSA is its timing in context of the surgical date. Although experts acknowledged the challenges involved, there was agreement that the greatest opportunity for preoperative diagnosis and treatment would come only with a more deliberate push toward earlier screening. Primary care providers and surgeons should share responsibility for early identification of OSA in patients who are scheduled for surgery as this would allow more time to optimize preoperative preparation. This could involve clinic-based screening at the initial surgical visit.", "type": "Document"}

BEST PREOPERATIVE PRACTICES IN PATIENTS WHO ARE DIAGNOSED WITH OSA, NONADHERENT WITH PRESCRIBED THERAPY, OR HAVE A HIGH PRETEST PROBABILITY FOR OSA\nBecause OSA remains undiagnosed in the majority of surgical patients, many patients will be identified as having a high probability for OSA for the first time during the preoperative screening process. In addition, many patients with an established diagnosis of OSA either refuse to use or are poorly adherent with the prescribed therapy. As discussed herein, there are limited data to suggest that preoperative positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy, in the form of CPAP, autotitrated positive airway pressure (APAP), or bilevel positive airway pressure may improve perioperative outcomes. Alternative therapies used to treat OSA, such as surgery, oral appliances, negative pressure devices, hypoglossal nerve stimulation, positional therapies, nasal resistive valves, and other treatments have not been studied systematically in the perioperative setting, although some patients may be using these as primary therapy for their OSA. Ideally, identification of patients with OSA, whether adherent or nonadherent to therapy, and those with suspected OSA should take place well in advance of elective surgery to allow time for potential evaluation and management of OSA preoperatively. In clinical practice, many patients, however, are identified close to the operative time, often just days before or even immediately before surgery. Because of a lack of evidence to guide clinical decision making, considerable uncertainty exists regarding the need for further preoperative interventions. The objective in this section is to provide recommendations for the optimal preoperative practices for the care of diagnosed or suspected OSA patients to reduce perioperative complications. We first examined the evidence of the efficacy of CPAP for surgical patients in the perioperative period. The recommendations are divided into 3 parts: (i) surgical patients with diagnosed OSA who are adherent to PAP therapy; (ii) surgical patients with diagnosed OSA who are nonadherent to PAP therapy; and (iii) surgical patients with a high probability for having OSA. It should be noted that because there is limited literature on the best preoperative practices in patients with diagnosed or suspected OSA, some of the recommendations are based on data or evidence that is extrapolated from a nonsurgical setting.", "type": "Document"}

BEST PREOPERATIVE PRACTICES IN PATIENTS WHO ARE DIAGNOSED WITH OSA, NONADHERENT WITH PRESCRIBED THERAPY, OR HAVE A HIGH PRETEST PROBABILITY FOR OSA > 3.0 Evidence of the Efficacy of CPAP for Surgical Patients in the Perioperative Period\nPrevious guidelines have suggested that CPAP therapy should be considered preoperatively when OSA is severe; intraoperatively in patients under sedation if they have used CPAP previously; and postoperatively, when feasible, particularly if frequent or severe airway obstruction is evident during postoperative monitoring. A trade-off occurs when one considers the balance between potentially improved adverse events versus the increased utilization of health care resources resulting from additional interventions and monitoring. At present, <20% of patients with a diagnosis of OSA receive CPAP therapy, are observed in advanced care settings, or both in actual clinical practice. Implementing our search strategy on the use of perioperative CPAP, the initial electronic search identified 1970 articles (S4-7). After screening of the titles, abstracts, and manuscripts, 1964 articles were excluded. Six pertinent studies addressing the issue of surgical patients with OSA with or without CPAP were identified. Further citation search yielded 3 more relevant articles. The types of studies and the level of evidence are shown in Table In the 9 studies analyzed, the total number of OSA patients with either preoperative/postoperative CPAP therapy was 4380, and the total number of diagnosed or suspected OSA patients without preoperative/postoperative CPAP therapy was 3649. In patients with OSA, 9 studies demonstrated that CPAP applied preoperatively and/or postoperatively may have some beneficial effect on postoperative complications. These studies are mainly of low to moderate quality with 2 RCTs, 2 prospective cohorts, 4 retrospective matched cohorts, and 1 case series (Table In 2 studies, CPAP significantly reduced the postoperative AHI compared with the preoperative baseline (preoperative AHI versus postoperative AHI: 37 \u00b1 19 vs 12 \u00b1 16 events/h). A recent meta-analysis showed a trend toward significance for reduction in the length of hospital stay of 0.4 days favoring the CPAP group (CPAP versus no CPAP: 4.0 \u00b1 4 vs 4.4 \u00b1 8 days, P = .05). In addition to the studies noted previously, 2 recent large retrospective studies suggest potential efficacy of CPAP in patients with diagnosed OSA. In the first study, those patients diagnosed with OSA and provided with a prescription for CPAP therapy before their surgery had a significantly reduced risk for cardiovascular adverse events compared to patients with undiagnosed OSA (odds ratio [OR], 0.34; 95% confidence interval, 0.15\u20130.77; P = .009). Patients with severe OSA or undiagnosed OSA were found to have a significantly increased risk for cardiorespiratory complications. The second study found that untreated OSA patients had significantly greater cardiopulmonary complication rates compared to those with prescribed PAP therapy (risk-adjusted rates 6.7% vs 4%; adjusted OR = 1.8, P = .001). Both myocardial infarction (adjusted OR = 2.6, P = .031) and unplanned reintubations (adjusted OR = 2.5, P = .003) were significantly greater in untreated OSA patients. These 2 large database studies provide preliminary evidence supporting preoperative diagnosis of OSA and treatment with CPAP therapy. There are 3 studies, 2 prospective and 1 retrospective, on empiric APAP therapy in the perioperative care of patients with newly diagnosed untreated OSA. Each study reported a different primary outcome: perioperative AHI versus length of stay versus APAP adherence. None of the studies was sufficiently powered to address the impact of APAP on postoperative complications; and in one study, patients with suspected OSA who were at >10% risk for postoperative cardiac complications as estimated by American College of Physicians criteria were excluded if they had an abnormal overnight oximetry study. The adherence to APAP therapy in these studies was uniformly low. Approximately 45% of patients with newly diagnosed OSA were adherent to APAP therapy in the perioperative period.", "type": "Document"}

Grade of Recommendation: Weak for)\nAs OSA is associated with numerous poor health outcomes including risk of death, cardiovascular events, and average number of days hospitalized, and treatment of OSA appears to improve these outcomes, it is clinically important to diagnose OSA in those patients screened at high risk, and for these patients to have ongoing, long-term management. Relevant to identifying patients in preoperative screening, a recent 2-year follow-up survey study found that patients diagnosed with OSA in the preoperative setting who were adherent to CPAP therapy experienced long-term health benefits and a reduction in medication usage. It should be recognized that questionnaires or other screening processes are imperfect diagnostic tools with low to moderate specificity. As such they tend to overdiagnose, with a significant proportion of patients labeled as at risk of OSA when they may not have the condition. It is important to differentiate between patients identified as at increased risk of having OSA and those who have been accurately diagnosed with OSA. If a patient is overdiagnosed or misdiagnosed as having OSA, this could have negative consequences in terms of any future surgical procedure, health insurance costs, and the ability to continue to drive. Accurate diagnosis is a necessary precursor to appropriate treatment. Conversely, ruling out OSA in patients who screened as at risk for OSA eliminates many of the negative consequences from overdiagnosis. The Task Force recommends that patients identified as being at high risk of OSA during preoperative screening be advised to notify their primary care provider of this status so that referral for further evaluation can be discussed.

In view of the increased risk of perioperative complications associated with OSA, surgical safety for patients with OSA is a substantial concern on a global level. As of July 2015, the Joint Commission, Division of Health Care Improvement, had received 61 sentinel perioperative event reports in which a patient was diagnosed with or suspected of having OSA. The Joint Commission cited the following concerns regarding the perioperative care of patients in the setting of OSA: (1) lack of training for health care professionals to screen for and recognize OSA; (2) failure to assess patients for OSA; (3) lack of guidelines for the care and treatment of individuals at risk for and those diagnosed with OSA; (4) failure to implement appropriate monitoring of patients with risk factors associated with OSA; (5) lack of communication among health care providers regarding patients with OSA or potential risk factors associated with OSA; and (6) lack of postoperative evaluation and treatment for OSA. These are all areas waiting for further improvement. The primary goal of this SASM guideline is to ensure optimal preoperative evaluation of patients with diagnosed or suspected OSA to improve patient safety. There is now firm evidence that these patients are at increased risk of postoperative complications. Preoperative evaluation, best done in an anesthesia preoperative clinic, enhances anesthetic management of chronic medical conditions such as OSA through documentation of health status and, where appropriate, initiation of investigations to pursue diagnostic possibilities raised in the screening process including referral to appropriate subspecialists. Primary care providers and surgeons require education regarding the increased risk of postoperative complications present in diagnosed or undiagnosed OSA patients. They should be alert to the possibility of OSA in their patients and attempt to identify it early in the surgical planning process to allow optimal preoperative preparation and risk stratification. OSA is a heterogeneous disorder with multiple causes and different phenotypes. The clinical practice of sleep medicine is changing rapidly with wider availability of simple home-based diagnostics and more readily acceptable treatments. There is some evidence supporting the desirability of preoperative diagnosis of OSA and treatment with CPAP therapy. The time between the decision to perform surgery and the date of the surgery should allow for optimization of patient health, including identification and management of OSA where it exists. With proper training in sleep medicine, anesthesiologists may be able to diagnose and treat OSA in the perioperative setting. The overall costs of health care could be reduced by treating sleep apnea as the number of hospital admissions and their costs have been shown to be lower in OSA patients on CPAP versus no therapy. At present, we believe that there is insufficient evidence to support canceling or delaying surgery to perform sleep studies and to initiate PAP therapy in those patients identified as being at high risk of OSA preoperatively, unless there is evidence of significant or uncontrolled systemic disease. Additional subspecialty evaluation for preoperative cardiopulmonary optimization should be considered in patients who have a known diagnosis of OSA, are nonadherent to PAP therapy, and have uncontrolled systemic conditions such as hypoventilation, severe pulmonary hypertension, or resting hypoxemia in the absence of other known cardiopulmonary disease. These concerns may also apply to patients with suspected OSA who have these problems. These considerations make a case for fast track consultation and PAP therapy services, facilitating access to diagnosis and treatment for such patients. Regardless of whether the diagnosis of OSA was established before surgery or not, anesthesiologists, surgeons, and institutions should develop an institutional protocol for patients with known or suspected OSA, including type of anesthesia, choice of medications, postoperative analgesic regimens, monitoring, and appropriate preoperative/postoperative referral to reduce complications and to ensure the best possible patient outcome.", "type": "Document"}

Glucagon\u2010like peptide\u20101 is secreted from the L cells throughout the intestinal tract, with higher concentrations in the distal ileum, and GIP from the K cells in the duodenum and jejunum, both in response to glucose in the gut lumen [ The GLP\u20101RAs liraglutide, semaglutide and dulaglutide are used increasingly for people with diabetes mellitus because of improvement in glycaemic control and reduction in risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (Table However, the peri\u2010operative use of these drugs is subject to scrutiny. Some studies suggest an association between peri\u2010operative GLP\u20101 RA use and increased risk of pulmonary aspiration, with a reported OR (95%CI) of 10.23 (2.94\u201335.82) in the elective surgical setting [ In people using GLP\u20101 RAs long\u2010term [ First, it is important to understand the data on gastric motility. There is clear evidence that GLP\u20101 RAs are associated with delayed gastric emptying in most settings, as shown by: endoscopy [ Most studies examining these concerns have reported surrogate outcomes. However, case reports describing clinically relevant evidence for delayed gastric emptying in appropriately starved patients either undergoing sedation or general anaesthesia for elective procedures [ The pharmacokinetic and dynamic profile of GLP\u20101 RAs must also be considered [ The individual patient profile is clearly relevant. All people taking GLP\u20101 RAs have at least two risk factors for delayed gastric emptying: the drug plus either diabetes mellitus or obesity (or both). Indeed, six of the ten published case reports included people with at least three different risk factors for pulmonary aspiration (see online Supporting Information Table There are also other considerations with respect to a potentially full stomach. Firstly, the presence of gastric content, whilst a pre\u2010requisite, does not in itself lead to pulmonary aspiration but is one of many variables. Indeed, some data suggest that 6\u201316% of patients who appropriately followed fasting guidelines for elective surgery have gastric content or volumes associated with a higher risk of aspiration [ The decision to perform rapid sequence intubation for patients with a presumed full stomach also carries additional potential risks, including difficult and failed tracheal intubation; oesophageal intubation; anaphylaxis; awareness under general anaesthesia; and airway trauma. Moreover, there are other interventions that can be implemented to reduce the risk of pulmonary aspiration, and rapid sequence intubation is merely one intervention. Others include: administration of prokinetics (e.g. erythromycin 3 mg.kg\u20101 1\u20132 h before induction) [ On the other hand, the impact of stopping these drugs must also be considered. Peri\u2010operative hyperglycaemia is associated with harm [ The UK guideline for the peri\u2010operative management of people with diabetes mellitus undergoing surgery contains practical guidance on the pre\u2010operative manipulation of all diabetes mellitus medications, including on the day before or the day of surgery, whether in the morning or the afternoon [ Stress hyperglycaemia is a transiently raised blood glucose concentration in people not known previously to have diabetes mellitus. It occurs most frequently in people at risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus, including, but not limited to: people living with obesity; a previous history of gestational diabetes mellitus; a family history of diabetes mellitus; long\u2010term glucocorticoid use; age > 40 y; or people of South Asian ancestry. People who develop stress hyperglycaemia have more adverse peri\u2010operative outcomes than those with diabetes mellitus [ Given the complexities highlighted, recommendations on pre\u2010operative timing of cessation alone are probably not sufficient to manage peri\u2010operative risk in patients receiving anaesthesia for procedures (Box Box 1Recommendations for the peri\u2010operative management of patients taking glucagon\u2010like peptide\u20101 receptor agonists and glucose\u2010dependent insulinotropic peptide.

This could include: administering prokinetics; using a tracheal tube; modified rapid sequence intubation (with or without cricoid force, depending on local practice); head\u2010up position for induction of anaesthesia; potential use of gastric tubes to empty the stomach before induction of anaesthesia and tracheal extubation; and awake tracheal extubation.", "type": "Document"}

However, unusually, their pharmacodynamic effect on urinary glucose excretion lasts significantly beyond effective plasma drug concentrations in people with or without type 2 diabetes mellitus. Although, 24 h after cessation there is only 25% of the plasma drug concentration remaining, there does continue to be increased urinary glucose excretion beyond 48 h. If sodium\u2010glucose cotransporter\u20102 inhibitors are stopped for 72 h, < 1% remains in the circulation and urinary glucose excretion normalises to baseline. Theoretically, the pharmacodynamic effect on urinary glucose excretion would be associated with the changes in insulin/glucagon ratio, and therefore risk of ketone generation may be better linked to the pharmacodynamic effects rather than plasma drug concentrations. In the peri\u2010operative setting, there are differing recommendations on when these drugs should be stopped pre\u2010operatively. Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) guidance suggests these drugs should be omitted the day before planned major surgery, whilst the guidance from the US Food and Drug Administration recommends considering cessation 3\u20134 days before any scheduled surgery [ The major concern about the peri\u2010operative use of SGLT2 inhibitors is the development of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and particularly euglycaemic DKA and ketoacidosis in those with or without diabetes mellitus, where the glucose concentrations are normal (i.e. < 11.0 mmol.l\u20101). With the lowering of glucose concentrations, and the resultant change in the insulin/glucagon ratio and the predisposition to develop ketosis, any increase in physiological stress that leads to the production of counterregulatory hormones further drives the development of hyperketonaemia. Because of the speed of increased ketone concentrations and the inability to compensate for the resulting acidaemia, ketone concentrations can rise quickly to > 3.0 mmol.l\u20101, and the pH may drop to < 7.3 which is the threshold for defining DKA [\u20101 or there is a history of diabetes mellitus [ Data suggest that the risk of peri\u2010operative DKA in those patients taking an SGLT2 inhibitor is higher than in those who are not (1.02 vs. 0.69 per 1000 patients, OR 1.48, 95%CI 1.02\u20132.15, p = 0.037) [ Until recently, it was thought that people without diabetes mellitus had sufficient insulin concentrations to prevent significant ketosis, but two recent publications have challenged this [ The same argument made for cessation of GLP\u20101RAs and the resultant harms from peri\u2010operative hyperglycaemia can also be made with cessation of SGLT2 inhibitors. Moreover, data suggest that cessation of SGLT2 inhibitors in people receiving them for heart failure may be associated with worsening of heart failure [ Box 2Recommendations for the peri\u2010operative management of patients taking sodium\u2010glucose cotransporter\u20102 inhibitors.

There are reports of postoperative ketoacidosis occurring even when patients have withheld SGLT2 inhibitors for > 72 h, emphasising that the risk of complications is a continuum rather than having a defined threshold when ketoacidosis will not occur. Importantly, mitigations to complications during the time of withholding SGLT2 inhibitors may be beneficial, such as ensuring patients remain well hydrated, avoid long starvation periods, and adequate glucose and ketone monitoring. In settings of unplanned or unavoidable prolonged fasting, there may be safety benefits to considering glucose\u2010containing intravenous fluids to mitigate ketone generation. Before certain types of surgery, including bariatric and some laparoscopic procedures, patients may be started on a very low\u2010energy diet, also known as a liver reduction diet [ Sick\u2010day rules (also known as sick\u2010day medication guidance) are adjustments that need to made to medicines to reduce the risk of adverse medicine\u2010related events during acute illness, and involve either withholding or dose adjustment of treatment [", "type": "Document"}

Studies to date are predominantly case reports or retrospective clinical trials with potential for bias.

As the adverse outcomes of interest occur with relative infrequency, definitive conclusions will likely only be reached through large prospective observational studies. We have an opportunity to develop such datasets through collaboration and effective use of data sharing.

The guideline development process followed the Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach and guideline recommendations are based on systematic reviews of relevant studies that included critical appraisal of the quality of the evidence and the strength of recommendations. However, many recommendations, for which there was no evidence or no systematic search for evidence was undertaken by the Evidence Review Team, were issued as ungraded expert opinion recommendations. The guideline work group concluded that a comprehensive approach to risk assessment should replace decisions based on assessments of single risk factors in isolation. Original data analyses were undertaken to produce a \u201cproof-in-concept\u201d risk-prediction model for kidney failure to support a framework for quantitative risk assessment in the donor candidate evaluation and defensible shared decision making. This framework is grounded in the simultaneous consideration of each candidate's profile of demographic and health characteristics. The processes and framework for the donor candidate evaluation are presented, along with recommendations for optimal care before, during, and after donation. Limitations of the evidence are discussed, especially regarding the lack of definitive prospective studies and clinical outcome trials. Suggestions for future research, including the need for continued refinement of long-term risk prediction and novel approaches to estimating donation-attributable risks, are also provided.In citing this document, the following format should be used: Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Living Kidney Donor Work Group.

Determining acceptability or nonacceptability of donor candidates requires an assessment of their potential risks and anticipated benefits of donation, independent of intended recipient issues. Donation must be voluntary (autonomous), and the motivation for donation must be altruistic \u2013 to satisfy a well-considered desire to help another person. There must be protection from undue pressure or coercion at every step in the evaluation and donation process, including the option to confidentially withdraw from the evaluation or to decline to donate at any time with the full support of the transplant program. In addition to these ethical principles, protection of patient privacy must be ensured. However, information regarding donor lifestyle, exposures or medical history that increase the risk for transmission of disease may need to be disclosed to the intended recipient for donation and transplantation to proceed; donor candidates should be given the opportunity to withdraw if they do not consent to sharing relevant personal health information in such circumstances. Preservation of donor candidate autonomy and minimization of short-term and long-term risks are high priorities in the practice of living donation. The transplant program has the responsibility to disclose anticipated risks and benefits to the donor candidate and intended recipient, tailored when possible for the characteristics of each donor candidate. The donor candidate must have adequate time to make an informed decision and must accept the need for long-term follow-up. The transplant program must offer support for decision-making through education and the informed consent process, and has a responsibility to confirm that the donor candidate understands the likely risks and benefits of donation.

A central objective of donor candidate evaluation and selection is to minimize risks of short-term and long-term adverse outcomes after donation, and to ensure the risks are acceptable. Consistent, transparent and defensible decision-making to accept or decline a living kidney donor candidate has been limited by the lack of an evidence-based means to provide individualized, quantitative estimates of postdonation risk. Prior living kidney donor guidelines describe postdonation risk in relation to single predonation characteristics assessed in isolation, and generally agree on the single predonation characteristics that are associated with higher risks of poor postdonation outcomes. However, prior guidelines often differ on the recommended specific threshold for a characteristic that should be used to accept or decline living donor candidates, and are unclear about how values above or below the threshold alter the risk of postdonation outcomes. There have been several calls to improve the current status quo, and to support better shared decision making between donor candidates and their transplant professionals. An important advance is quantification of the combined impact of all of a donor candidate\u2019s predonation demographic (eg, age, sex, and race) and health characteristics at the time of evaluation (eg, kidney function, blood pressure [BP], body mass index [BMI], and so on) on the risk of serious adverse outcomes after donation. Serious postdonation adverse outcomes can be surgical, medical or psychosocial, and may occur during the perinephrectomy period, in a fixed period of long-term follow-up (eg, 15 years after donation), or for the remaining lifespan of the donor. As described within this overall framework, a transplant program can use various methods to establish its threshold for acceptable outcomes after kidney donation. For example, if a transplant program decides a lifetime postdonation risk of kidney failure of up to 5% is acceptable, and if a candidate\u2019s projected risk is estimated to be above this threshold, the program should decline this candidate as a donor. Donor candidate autonomy does not overrule medical judgment and transplant professionals are ethically justified to decline a donor candidate when they believe the risk of poor postdonation outcomes is too high. A poor outcome can have a very negative impact on the donor, on their recipient, and on public opinions about living donation. Each transplant program should strive to develop and communicate a quantitative threshold of \u201cacceptable risk\u201d for each serious postdonation adverse outcome it wishes to avoid. Thresholds should be both evidence-based and consensus-based, and there are various sources of evidence and processes by which consensus can be achieved. Once established, a threshold should be applied consistently and transparently for all donor candidates evaluated by a program (unless subsequently revised). When a donor candidate\u2019s estimated risk is below the acceptable risk threshold, the transplant program should accept a donor candidate, and it should be the candidate\u2019s decision whether or not to proceed with living kidney donation after being informed of the risks. When a candidate\u2019s estimated risk is above the acceptable threshold, the transplant program is justified in declining the candidate and can ground its decision in a quantitative framework (Figure During the development of this guideline we have advanced concepts and analyses to support this framework and approach. Here we discuss certain serious adverse outcomes and their amenability to quantitative risk estimation. We focus particularly on the postdonation development of kidney failure requiring dialysis or transplantation because it is a central outcome of a donor candidate\u2019s long-term risk. Finally, we describe the path for future work necessary to strengthen this framework, which includes the need for additional data.", "type": "Document"}

The 90-day all-cause mortality in a recent United States (US) study of 80 347 donors was reported to be approximately 1 in 3000 (0.03%) based on 25 deaths. Similar rates have also been reported in other studies. Given the low incidence of perioperative mortality, estimates for predonation characteristics that alter the risk of perioperative death are imprecise. For example, in this same study, a predonation history of hypertension was associated with a 1 in 270 risk of 90-day mortality. However, this estimate was based only on 2 observed deaths, and the estimate would have substantially changed if 1 more or less death was observed; the 95% CI for the estimate was also wide, ranging from 1 in 75 to 1 in 2220. Thus, even if a transplant program defines an acceptable risk threshold for perinephrectomy mortality (for example, an incidence less than 1 in 1000), it will be difficult at this time to reliably determine a given donor candidate\u2019s estimated risk of this outcome according to their profile of predonation characteristics. With respect to perioperative complications, the ERT identified 2 systematic reviews that examined perinephrectomy outcomes in relation to demographic and health characteristics of accepted donors. The ERT rated the quality of this evidence as very low (Evidence Report Tables 6 and 7, SDC, http://links.lww.com/TP/B434). In one review, a group of selected older donors (mean age, 66 years; range, 60 to 85 years at donation) did not differ statistically from a group of younger donors in their operative time, intraoperative blood loss, and length of hospital stay. In both reviews, groups of selected obese donors (mean BMI of 34.5 kg/m2; range 32-39 kg/m2) did not differ statistically from groups of nonobese donors in their rates of perioperative complications, operative time, blood loss and length of hospital stay. Since then a large US study examined predonation characteristics associated with a higher risk of donor nephrectomy-related complications (as assessed through administrative data rather than adjudication, using a composite outcome of digestive, respiratory, procedural, urinary, hemorrhage, infectious or cardiac complications). In this study, where each donor candidate characteristic was considered by itself (rather than as a combination of characteristics), complication rates were higher in men versus women (9.6% vs 7.2%); among African Americans (10.4%) and whites (8.7%) compared with other racial groups (6.3%); among donors without private insurance (8.5%) compared with those who had private insurance (7.3%); and among donors with hypertension (17.7%) compared with those without hypertension (7.9%). A subsequent study integrated national US donor registry data from 2008 to 2012 with administrative records from a consortium of 98 academic hospitals and found that 16.8% of donors experienced a diagnosis or procedure for a perinephrectomy complication, most commonly gastrointestinal (4.4%), bleeding (3.0%), respiratory (2.5%), and surgical/anesthesia-related injuries (2.4%). Major complications, defined as Clavien severity level 4 or 5, were identified in 2.5% of donors. After adjustment for demographic, clinical (including comorbidities), procedure, and center factors, compared with white donors, African Americans had significantly higher risks (P < 0.05) of experiencing any complication (18.2% vs 15.5%) and of experiencing major complications (3.7% vs 2.2%). Other significant correlates of major complications included obesity, predonation blood disorders, psychiatric conditions, and robotic nephrectomy, while greater annual hospital volume predicted lower risk. As future data become available, it may become possible for transplant programs to estimate the risk of well-defined, serious perioperative complications according to a donor candidate\u2019s individual profile of baseline characteristics, and to compare these estimates to a threshold of acceptable risk to inform donor acceptance decisions.", "type": "Document"}

While there are many outcomes to consider after kidney donation, a central outcome directly related to having one kidney removed is the long-term risk of developing kidney failure requiring dialysis or transplantation, commonly referred to as ESKD. Donor candidates often have a good understanding of the health effects of kidney failure, as their reason to donate is to treat the kidney failure of their intended recipient. For these reasons, we have grounded a quantitative framework for medical evaluation and acceptance of donor candidates on the long-term risk of postdonation kidney failure. Each donor candidate has a long-term risk (cumulative incidence) of developing kidney failure that is influenced by the combination of risks conferred by their demographic and health characteristics at the time of evaluation plus risk attributable to donation (Figure Challenges to determining the postdonation lifetime risk of kidney failure based on current studies include limitations of study follow-up (the largest studies followed most donors for less than 2 decades rather than for their lifetime). The risk of kidney failure after donation is nonlinear, and is expected to be higher later (\u226510 years) than earlier (<10 years) after donation. When the WG was convened, 2 recent studies reported that the risk of kidney failure is higher in donors compared with risk among nondonors with similar baseline demographics. The ERT assessed the quality of evidence from these 2 studies as moderate (Table ). Available data suggest that the average donation-attributable risk of kidney failure is approximately 27 per 10 000 (0.3%) at 15 years, but there is substantial uncertainty in the estimate, and there are not sufficient data to project lifetime donation-attributable risk. Furthermore, the extent to which donation-attributable risk varies according to individual health characteristics is not known, although available evidence suggests there is higher donation-attributable risks in some subgroups, such African Americans compared with white donors. Existing large population-based studies can help estimate the long-term risk of treated kidney failure in the absence of donation, based on a candidate\u2019s predonation health characteristics. Furthermore, if the risk of kidney failure attributable to donation becomes more precisely understood in relation to an individual\u2019s profile of baseline characteristics, then demographic-related, health status related, and donation-attributable risks can be aggregated to project individualized estimates of long-terms risks of postdonation kidney failure. To help advance this paradigm, we enlisted the help of the CKD-Prognosis Consortium (CKD-PC) to develop a tool to project the 15-year and lifetime incidence of kidney failure in the absence of donation based on demographic and health characteristics at the time of evaluation in low-risk persons from large population cohorts. CKD-PC is a research group composed of investigators who analyze large cohort data and perform collaborative meta-analyses. The methods and results of these analyses are reviewed briefly here and presented in expanded form in a separate publication. To project the estimated long-term incidence of kidney failure among persons who do not donate a kidney according to 10 demographic and health characteristics, risk associations were derived from a meta-analysis of 7 general population cohorts. Relative risks were calibrated to the population-level annual incidence of ESKD in the United States, derived from actual ESKD incidence and mortality data collected by the US Renal Data System and overall mortality data from the US Census. Fifteen-year projections were compared with the observed risk among 52 998 living kidney donors in the United States. For estimation of relative risks related to health characteristics, a total of 4 933 314 participants from 7 cohorts were followed for a median of 4 to 16 years. For a 40-year-old person with health characteristics similar to those of age-matched kidney donors, the 15-year projections of ESKD risk in the absence of donation varied according to race and sex; the risk was 0.24% among black men, 0.15% among black women, 0.06% among white men, and 0.04% among white women. Risk projections were higher in the presence of lower eGFR, higher albuminuria, hypertension, current or former smoking, diabetes, and obesity. In the model-based lifetime projections, the risk of ESKD was highest among persons in the youngest age group, particularly among young black persons. The 15-year observed postdonation risks among kidney donors in the United States were 3.5 to 5.3 times as high as the projected risks in healthy persons in the absence of donation, according to sex and race. This study has important limitations. First, the projections were calibrated to historical incidence rates of ESKD from US population data. Annual incidence was derived with the use of life-table methods, which assume a constant age-, sex-, and race-specific incidence of ESKD over periods of decades and a static population substructure. Second, information on certain health characteristics of interest was not available, including heritable and environmental factors. The estimates reflect population averages for unmeasured characteristics. Donor candidates with a family history of kidney disease (especially younger candidates with such history) would be expected to have a higher risk of ESKD than projected. Third, the relative risk estimates were based on low-risk cohorts followed for a median of 4 to 16 years, based on an assumption of proportional hazards and after testing for nonproportionality. The analysis does not include untreated low GFR as an outcome, a condition that is more common among older persons, nor did it assess the risk of other outcomes, such as hypertension or preeclampsia, that have been linked to kidney donation. Finally, the analysis did not estimate the age at which ESKD would be expected develop in a donor candidate or the duration of ESKD before death. The resulting risk models were incorporated into an online risk prediction tool for 15-year and lifetime ESKD risk (http://www.transplantmodels.com/esrdrisk/). Although the risk tool was developed specifically for the United States, the methods used may be adapted to other countries with the availability of local data sources. The WG endorses use of the online tool as the foundation for a new evaluation framework centered on simultaneous consideration of multiple demographic and health characteristics to predict long-term risk of an important outcome, while recognizing limitations in precision of risk estimates and uncertainty in donation-attributable risk. These models should be refined through further research to improve the precision and generalizability of predonation risk estimates and to incorporate estimates of indivdualized risk attributable to donation. We endorse a quantitative framework for donor candidate evaluation and acceptance centered on lifetime risk of postdonation kidney failure (Table Currently, there remains uncertainty in lifetime risk estimates, particularly for younger donor candidates, donors from developing countries, and ethnicities other than black or white race. At this time, transplant programs and donor candidates may consider other factors in their acceptance criteria for living kidney donation in addition to quantitative risk estimates. We see this work as starting point, and advocate strongly for continued efforts to improve the precision, tailoring and generalizability of predonation and postdonation risk estimates. Quantifying donation-attributable risk according to predonation demographic and health profile is a leading priority for future research, and we will update the online tool once estimates are available. In summary, we advocate for a quantitative paradigm wherein transplant programs accept or decline donor candidates using the strongest evidence-based criteria currently available to simultaneously consider a profile of risk factors (demographic and health characteristics at evaluation and risk attributable to donation) and support consistent, transparent and defensible decisions. Ongoing efforts are needed to strengthen and advance this paradigm, including incorporation of data from cohorts observed for longer periods of time (ideally over the lifetime) and from diverse countries; estimation of risks related to genetic and familial factors; and quantification of donation-attributable risks according to multiple predonation health characteristics. The scope of the current guideline is focused on donor safety, and excludes consideration of recipient outcomes based on donor characteristics. However, we appreciate that a donor candidate\u2019s profile of predonation characteristics may also have important impacts on posttransplant recipient outcomes, and that topic also warrants future consideration.", "type": "Document"}

To date, donor candidate informed consent processes have been shown to vary widely across transplant programs worldwide, with discrepancies noted in standards, consistency and implementation. It has been recommended that the informed consent structure and process be the same for donor candidates regardless of relationship (or lack thereof for nondirected donation) between the donor candidate and their intended recipient. Transplant programs must assure a donor candidate is acting voluntarily and not yielding to pressure or coercion. It is best if evaluations of the donor candidate and the intended recipient are performed by separate teams to mitigate potential conflict of interest. A recommendation that the donor candidate be evaluated by a team that is independent of the evaluation of the intended recipient is also recommended in several past guidelines. The process of informed consent with a living kidney donor candidate should include discussions with a healthcare professional skilled and knowledgeable in organ donation and in evaluating a person\u2019s comprehension of the information. In the United States, to minimize conflict of interest, living donor recovery hospitals must designate and provide each donor candidate with an Independent Living Donor Advocate who is independent of the intended recipient\u2019s evaluation and the decision to transplant the intended recipient. This person seeks to ensure that the rights of the donor candidate are protected, that all the requirements of informed consent are met, and that the donation decision is made voluntarily. Other countries may use other strategies such as an external review of planned donations to ensure that independence, advocacy for the donor\u2019s rights, and voluntarism are respected. While avoidance of conflict of interest is a central principle, it also remains important that healthcare professionals in the teams evaluating the donor candidate and intended recipient work together to ensure effective communication and coordination of the donation and transplant processes. For example, it would be inefficient to fully evaluate a donor candidate if their intended recipient does not meet eligibility criteria for transplantation.", "type": "Document"}

Some prior guidelines have suggested use of a standardized checklist to ensure that all items are disclosed. For US programs, the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) has developed an informed consent checklist for programs to support compliance with policy requirements and a patient resource (English and Spanish translations) to explain the process in lay language for donor candidates. The donor candidate needs to be informed from the onset of what is involved in the donor evaluation, including the required assessments and anticipated timelines. In general, education about the process and potential outcomes of living donation should be introduced in a manner conducive to learning and understanding. Prior guidelines and policy statements have recommended that discussions be provided in a language that enables meaningful dialogue between the donor candidate and transplant program staff, using communication strategies and materials that are culturally sensitive. The information should also be presented in a sympathetic environment, using simple language, allowing time for questions, with information that is appropriate to a candidate\u2019s understanding and experience, at a pace determined by their needs. Repetition of key information, and use of approaches that foster adult learning, are prudent. The information to be disclosed to the donor candidate is described in many prior guidelines and policy statements. Some regulations require minimum content elements that must be disclosed in the informed consent process, and these requirements should be respected when locally applicable. The donor candidate must also provide consent for some tests performed during the evaluation, such as consent to receive intravenous contrast for renal imaging. In this guideline, we present a list of the content of recommended disclosures during the donor candidate evaluation, considering these prior guidelines and policies (Table Treatment alternatives available to transplant candidates (in general terms, not with specific recipient medical information) should be disclosed to the donor candidate (Table The transplant program should inform the donor candidate of policies regarding confidentiality and anonymity in KPD and nondirected donation, and should ensure donor acceptance of these policies before donation. Some programs now permit biologically compatible pairs to participate in KPD; when this option is discussed, donor candidates who are biologically compatible with their intended recipient should voluntarily decide whether or not to pursue this option. Participating in donor evaluation includes risks of discovery. These risks include possible discovery of a health condition that requires referral for further care, discovery of a health condition that could affect the donor candidate\u2019s insurability or cost of insurance, or discovery of an infectious disease for which there is a reporting requirement to public health authorities. Transplant programs should establish policies for managing such discoveries, and share these policies with the donor candidate as part of the informed consent process for evaluation. Testing a donor candidate and intended recipient in a family for the purpose of assessing immune compatibility may identify misattributed biological relationships as an incidental finding. For example, misattributed paternity is estimated to occur in approximately 1 to 3% of father-child living kidney donor-recipient pairs, or approximately 0.25% to 0.5% of all living kidney donation evaluations. Transplant programs should establish a policy on how or whether this information is disclosed. The donor candidate should be informed of donation-related surgical, medical, and psychosocial outcomes and risks as provided in other chapters of this guideline, individualized whenever possible for donor characteristics, and including the uncertainty of estimates. As described in chapter 1, 90-day all-cause mortality after donation in a US study of 80 347 donors (1994-2009) based on registry data and national death records was approximately 1 in 3000 (0.03%). Similar rates have also been reported in other studies. Given the low incidence of perinephrectomy mortality, estimates for predonation characteristics that alter the risk of perioperative death are imprecise. The donor candidate should be informed of anticipated recipient outcomes associated with living donor transplantation (such as 1-year, 5-year and median recipient graft and patient survival), and with available treatment alternatives including deceased kidney donor transplantation and different types of dialysis. US policy requires that donor candidates are provided with current national and program-specific 1-year transplant recipient patient and allograft survival statistics, and that donor candidates are also informed that any transplant candidate may have risk factors for increased likelihood of adverse outcomes (including graft failure, complications, mortality) that exceed local or national averages. Many regions have legislation that protects the confidentiality of personal health information, and the same protections apply to information collected during the donor candidate evaluation. The donor candidate should know that their personal health information will only be disclosed to their intended recipient or other parties if they provide permission to do so. The donor candidate should also know that it is likely they will be asked for permission to disclose certain personal health information to their intended recipient so that the intended recipient can provide informed consent for the transplant to occur. For example, in directed donation, while a donor candidate may wish to keep their act of donor evaluation initially confidential, if the transplant program does not permit anonymous directed donation, or if the intended recipient does not wish to proceed with anonymous directed donation, there may be a need for the donor candidate to provide permission for their identity to be disclosed to the intended recipient so that the intended recipient can make an informed decision about proceeding with the transplant. Similarly, donor candidates and intended recipients need to provide permission to make each other aware whether they are biologically compatible or not. During the donor evaluation process, it may be recognized that a donor candidate has additional health information that could impact the transplant outcome. For example, despite negative serological testing, a donor candidate may have a higher risk of specific infectious diseases based on his/her behavioral history. Some jurisdictions require standardized behavioral screening during the evaluation and consent from the donor candidate to inform the intended recipient of behavior associated with increased risk of certain infections, so that the intended recipient can provide informed consent for the transplant to proceed. Before donation the transplant program should also inform the donor candidate of requirements to share certain personal health information with the recipient after donation, such as in the rare circumstance where soon after transplant (ie, within 1-2 years) it is discovered the donor has evidence of a serious infectious disease or malignancy. It is possible that the intended recipient has health information that could impact transplant outcomes, and which the transplant team believes could affect the donor candidate\u2019s decision making. For example, some donor candidates may want to know if the recipient lost a previously transplanted kidney due to medication nonadherence. Knowledge of a genetic kidney disease in an intended recipient may be important for the evaluation and care of a genetically related donor candidate. As for the health information of donor candidates, personal health information collected during the transplant candidate\u2019s evaluation is protected under privacy law, and can only be shared with permission of the intended recipient. Prior guidelines, such as those of the British Transplantation Society and policy of the US OPTN, recommend disclosure of relevant information about the intended recipient to the donor candidate if the intended recipient has given consent; the British Transplantation Society also recommends that donation and transplant not proceed unless the relevant information is shared. The criteria for relevant information beyond the determination that the intended recipient is approved as a suitable transplant candidate by their evaluation team are currently undefined. Ongoing efforts are warranted to develop standardized criteria for the identification and disclosure of recipient risk factors for adverse transplant outcomes that may be relevant to donor decision making, and when donation and transplant should not proceed in the absence of disclosure, weighing considerations of privacy law, ethics, and the concerns of donor and recipient candidates (see Research Recommendations). Donor candidates should be informed of transplant program resources and personnel available to offer support. Such support can include psychological support in the setting of a poor recipient outcome after transplantation or donor complications, or financial reimbursement programs for out-of-pocket expenses incurred during the evaluation and donation process. The donor candidate should understand what is required of them after donation, including the likely timing and financial impacts of donation-related recommended lifelong healthcare. The donor candidate should also understand how this care will be provided after donation, and the transplant program\u2019s policy for providing any healthcare (and what types of healthcare) after donation. In the US transplant programs are required to collect and report follow-up data on donors for 2 years after donation. In nearly all places in the world it is a crime to knowingly acquire or obtain any human organ for valuable consideration (ie, for anything of value such as money or property). Some prior guidelines recommend the donor candidate sign a statement attesting that they are not donating a kidney for monetary gain; in the United States, such attestation is required for donation to proceed. The donor candidate should understand the withdrawal process from evaluation, and their right to withdraw at any time before donation with the full support of the transplant program (described further below in this guideline chapter). Finally, while transplant programs respect the autonomy of a donor candidate to proceed with donation based on their preferences, needs and values, programs remain ethically justified to decline a donor candidate who does not meet their eligibility criteria for donation (ie, when the donation is deemed to incur unacceptable risks). A donor candidate should understand the transplant program makes the final determination of whether the donor candidate is eligible for donation or not based on the results of their evaluation. If the donor candidate does not meet the transplant program\u2019s criteria for donation, the program should inform the donor candidate of the decision and reason. Being told they do not meet a transplant program\u2019s acceptance criteria is distressing for some donor candidates. The donor candidate should be informed how the transplant program will support them if they do not meet criteria for donation. Such support may include assistance in communicating the decision to the intended recipient; ongoing follow-up communication with the evaluation team; counseling related to the outcome of the evaluation; alternative ways of helping the intended recipient; and the possibility of referral to another program for a second opinion if the donor candidate does not accept the noneligibility decision.", "type": "Document"}

In current routine care, an assessment of a donor candidate\u2019s knowledge and comprehension of the possible outcomes of donation is typically done through discussions with healthcare professionals.

An instrument for assessing comprehension during informed consent for living liver donation has been pilot tested, and provides a model for developing similar instruments for comprehension assessment in living kidney donor candidates. It is common for many donor candidates to voice no concerns during the evaluation process about the donation, as they are using an emotional rather than deliberative decision-making process.

Special groups such as prisoners have unique considerations. Interviewing the donor candidate without the intended recipient, family members and other persons who could influence the donation decision is important in the assessment of voluntarism. Trust is maintained when the transplant program assures a donor candidate that their participation in evaluation and personal health information is confidential, to be shared with the intended recipient only with their approval. This enables the donor candidate to speak openly about their health and donation choices. For the purposes of donor candidacy, \u2018not deciding\u2019 about donation should be considered the same as \u2018deciding not to\u2019 proceed, as may occur in cases of ambivalent donor candidates who have not decided to proceed, but who also have not elected to formally withdraw from the donation process.

Participation in KPD requires KPD program-specific informed consent (Please see also chapter 2: Informed Consent for details). The transplant program should inform the donor candidate of policies regarding confidentiality and anonymity in KPD and nondirected donation, and should ensure donor acceptance of these policies before donation. Some programs now permit biologically compatible pairs to participate in KPD; when this option is discussed, donor candidates who are biologically compatible with their intended recipient should voluntarily decide whether or not to pursue this option. Donor candidates participating in KPD should be informed of the risks and benefits of kidney transport, possible organ redirection due to unforeseen circumstances, the inability to provide information on the ultimate recipient of their organ, as well as nonexchange donation options. Living donors participating in exchanges should have the option to travel to the recipient center; however, experience from countries with well-developed KPD programs suggests that transport of living donor kidneys can be accomplished safely without adversely impacting transplant outcomes, obviating the need for donor travel. In a survey of 30 US programs transporting 56 living donor kidneys (2007-2010), the creatinine nadir was less than 2.0 mg/dL (<177 \u03bcmol/L) in all recipients but one, and there were no cases of delayed graft function as defined by the need for dialysis in the first week. Continued feasible and safe transport of living donor kidneys in the United States has been reported. Nondirected donors (donor without an identified recipient) have the unique potential to expand the donor pool through chains of kidney exchanges. Nondirected donor candidates should be informed of opportunities for donating into a chain or KPD program, if available. Participation in KPD should be considered preferable to incompatible transplantation if participation is deemed to have \u201creasonable\u201d likelihood of yielding a compatible or lower-immunologic risk match for the donor candidate\u2019s intended recipient. Despite the expansion of KPD, blood group O candidates continue to have much lower rates of success on KPD lists than their non\u2013O counterparts, particularly in circumstances of broad HLA sensitization. Thus, for some transplant candidates, incompatible transplantation may offer their best option for transplantation without prolonged waiting times.", "type": "Document"}

In 1987, successful ABOi living donor transplantation was introduced in Japan using pretransplant antibody depletion, to expand access to transplantation in the absence of legal recognition of brain death. Since that time, ABOi transplantation evolved into routine practice and constituted nearly 14% of living donor transplant procedures performed in Japan in 2011. Recipient and donor candidates interested in ABOi living donor transplantation should be informed of possible complications and expected outcomes. US studies have reported higher rates of perioperative complications including hemorrhage, infections, and early graft loss compared with ABO-compatible (ABOc) transplantation. In contrast, some European and Asian studies have found no increases in early or longer-term complications after ABOi transplantation, possibly reflecting differences in preconditioning management protocols. Even in the US experience, after an early reduction in graft survival relative to blood ABOc living donor kidney transplant recipients, the average long-term graft survival in ABOi living donor transplant recipients is not inferior to, and often exceeds, that of ABOc deceased donor transplant recipients. In the United States, recipients of ABOi living donor kidney transplants also appear to incur higher costs of care before, during, and after transplant, although these costs increases are offset by avoiding long-term dialysis and its associated morbidity and costs.", "type": "Document"}

As described in chapter 1, the 90-day all-cause mortality in a US study of integrated donor registry data and national death records (80 347 donors, 1994-2009) was approximately 1 in 3000 (0.03%) based on 25 deaths. Similar rates have also been reported in other studies. Given the low incidence of perioperative mortality, estimates for predonation characteristics that alter the risk of perioperative death are imprecise. A US study recently described the incidence of perioperative complications in a large sample of living kidney donors from 1998 to 2010. Outcomes were assessed through administrative data, using a composite outcome of digestive, respiratory, procedural, urinary, hemorrhage, infectious or cardiac complications. The incidence of perioperative complications was 7.9% and decreased from 1998 to 2010 (from 10.1% to 7.6%). Limitations of this study include the lack of confirmation of donor status through patient level-linkages to the national registry, and use of weighting schemes to draw inferences for a \u201crepresented\u201d sample of all US donors based on a stratified sample of 20% of acute care hospitalizations. A subsequent study integrated national US donor registry data as a source of verified living donor status with administrative records from a consortium of 98 academic hospitals (2008 to 2012, n = 14 964), and found that 16.8% of donors experienced any perioperative complication, most commonly gastrointestinal (4.4%), bleeding (3.0%), respiratory (2.5%), and surgical/anesthesia-related injuries (2.4%). Major complications, defined as Clavien grading system for surgical complications level 4 or 5, affected 2.5% of donors. The limitations of administrative database studies, including possible coding biases, highlight the need for prospective collection of granular clinical data on living donor perioperative outcomes. A Norwegian registry-based study of 1022 living kidney donations performed between 1997 and 2008 recorded 30 (2.9%) major complications and 184 (18%) minor complications by Clavien grading. Readmission after surgery is commonly used as a measure of care quality and healthcare utilization. A recent study examined postnephrectomy readmission using integrated US living donor registry data, records from a nationwide pharmacy claims warehouse, and administrative records from an academic hospital consortium (N = 14 959 donors, 2008-2012). Overall, 2.9% of donors were readmitted to hospital within 90 days of donation. 11.3% donors filled 1 or greater opioid prescription in the year before donation, and those with the highest level predonation opioid use were more than twice as likely as nonusers to be readmitted within 90 days postdonation (6.8% vs 2.6%; adjusted odds ratio [OR]; 95% lower CI [OR] 95% upper CI 1.742.493.58). Adjusted readmission risk was also significantly (P < 0.05) higher for women (adjusted OR = 1.25), African Americans (adjusted OR = 1.45), spouses (adjusted OR = 1.42), exchange participants (adjusted OR = 1.46), uninsured donors (adjusted OR = 1.40), donors with predonation eGFR <60 mL/min per 1.73 m2 (adjusted OR = 2.68), donors with predonation pulmonary disease (adjusted OR = 1.54), and after robotic nephrectomy (adjusted OR = 1.68). Continued efforts to identify and prevent modifiable causes of postoperative complications in all donors are warranted to maximize safety of the donation procedure. Readers are encouraged to refer to chapter 17 for discussion of acceptable surgical approaches to donor nephrectomy and anticipated outcomes. As discussed in the Framework for this guideline (chapter 1), the transplant program team should provide the donor candidate with individualized quantitative estimates of short-term and long-term risks from kidney donation to the extent possible, including recognition of associated uncertainty, in a manner that is easily understood by donor candidates.", "type": "Document"}

There is no evidence to suggest that additional preoperative testing beyond guideline-based evaluation and management strategies used for other noncardiac surgeries results in a reduced incidence of perioperative complications in kidney donors. Some transplant programs routinely perform preoperative noninvasive cardiac testing in older living kidney donor candidates (eg, stress electrocardiogram, nuclear stress test), but this practice is not supported by existing evidence. Recent US guidelines for the general population do not recommend cardiac testing for those undergoing noncardiac surgery with no active symptoms of heart disease who have reasonable functional capacity (defined as at least 4 metabolic energy equivalents, which represents the ability to walk 2 blocks on ground level or carry 2 bags of groceries up one flight of stairs without symptoms). Outside the context of perioperative evaluation, other guidelines recommended against noninvasive cardiac testing for asymptomatic coronary artery disease, or conclude that there is insufficient evidence to warrant such testing. Recent guidelines on the assessment of bleeding risk before surgery or invasive procedures describe the following: (i) Routine coagulation screening before surgery to predict postoperative bleeding in unselected patients is not recommended; (ii) bleeding history assessment should include details of a family history of bleeding, previous excessive posttraumatic or postsurgical bleeding, and current use of antithrombotic drugs; (iii) if the bleeding history is negative, no further coagulation testing is indicated; (iv) comprehensive coagulation testing is warranted if the bleeding history is positive. Although evidence in the context of donor nephrectomy is lacking, current OPTN policy for living donor evaluation in the United States requires assessment of bleeding and clotting disorders in the medical history, and performance of coagulation testing, and other prior living donor evaluation guidelines have recommended blood coagulation testing. In a recent multicenter randomized trial of 10 010 patients undergoing noncardiac surgery, the use of aspirin before surgery and throughout the early postsurgical period had no significant effect on the risk of death or nonfatal myocardial infarction but increased the risk of major bleeding. The trial authors recommend aspirin not be started before surgery, and for those chronically taking aspirin to hold it at least 3 days before surgery. Recent guidelines for the prevention of perioperative venous thromboembolism (ie, deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) describe the use of a risk score (Rogers or Caprini score) to determine which of early ambulation, mechanical prophylaxis or perioperative unfractionated heparin (or low-molecular-weight heparin) is warranted to reduce risk. Factors associated with a higher risk of perioperative venous thromboembolism include older age, obesity, and the use of oral contraceptive or hormone replacement therapy. Many donors will be at low risk (<2%) of perioperative venous thromboembolism, and some guidelines suggest early ambulation is all that is required in individuals at low risk of such events. Guidelines to reduce the risk of perioperative pulmonary complications recommend a careful assessment of risk factors for postoperative pulmonary complications (conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or congestive heart failure which will be absent in almost all donors). Preoperative spirometry and chest radiography are not recommended as routine tests to predict the risk for postoperative pulmonary complications. Patients at higher risk for postoperative pulmonary complications may benefit from deep breathing exercises or incentive spirometry, or selective use of a nasogastric tube (as needed for postoperative nausea or vomiting, inability to tolerate oral intake, or symptomatic abdominal distention). The utility and difficulties of the preoperative evaluation for the potential identification of obstructive sleep apnea is described elsewhere. There have been 6 RCTs that enrolled smokers (ranging from 47 to 213 patients) to receive a smoking cessation intervention or not before surgery (procedures other than donor nephrectomy) and found that smoking cessation reduced the risk of perioperative complications.", "type": "Document"}

The foundations for this acceptance are the well-known relationships of alterations in kidney structure and GFR in kidney disease, and well known pathophysiologic relationships of kidney disease complications to decreased GFR. Normative levels of GFR are expressed per 1.73 m2 because GFR is proportional to kidney size, which is proportional to body size. Adjusting GFR to body surface area (BSA) reduces the variability in GFR in healthy individuals, allowing communication of GFR threshold for decision-making that can applied to most donors across the usual distribution of body size. Based on a large body of evidence, mean GFR in healthy young adult white individuals is approximately 125 mL/min per 1.73 m2, with a wide range. There is some evidence that the normal level of GFR varies among ethnic groups. GFR is affected by numerous physiologic and pathologic conditions and varies with time of day, dietary protein intake, exercise, age, pregnancy, obesity, hyperglycemia, use of antihypertensive drugs, surfeit or deficit of extracellular fluid, and acute and chronic kidney disease.

GFR can be measured indirectly as the clearance of exogenous filtration markers or estimated from serum levels of endogenous filtration markers, but both measured GFR (mGFR) and estimated GFR (eGFR) are associated with error in their determination. We recommend that the transplant program use the best available method to assess GFR in donor candidates, recognizing that at many centers, more than one method may be available. The accuracy of various methods for measuring and estimating GFR is not known with sufficient certainty to define specific threshold for each method. The KDIGO 2012 CKD guidelines for GFR evaluation in the general population recommend expressing kidney function as GFR and not as serum creatinine concentration, and recommend expressing GFR in mL/min per 1.73 m2 rather than mL/min. The guidelines recommend 2-stage testing (initial testing followed by confirmatory testing as necessary). The WG concluded that these general recommendations were applicable to living kidney donor candidates. The eGFR based on serum creatinine (eGFRcr) is the recommended initial test. Serum creatinine assays should be traceable to the international reference standard. In North America, Europe, and Australia, the 2009 CKD CKD-EPI creatinine equation should be used unless other equations have been shown to be more accurate. eGFRcr using the 2009 CKD-EPI creatinine equation has minimal bias at normal GFR; however, it is imprecise (Figure In regions other than North America, Europe, and Australia, the 2009 CKD-EPI creatinine equation is less accurate. In these regions, other equations are recommended if they are more accurate than the 2009 CKD-EPI creatinine equation. GFR estimating equations are developed using regression methodologies to relate the mGFR to steady state serum creatinine concentration and a combination of demographic and clinical variables as surrogates of the non-GFR determinants of serum creatinine. By definition, GFR estimates using serum creatinine concentration are more accurate in estimating mGFR than the serum creatinine concentration alone in the study population in which they were developed. Sources of error in GFR estimation from serum creatinine concentration include nonsteady-state conditions, nonGFR determinants of serum creatinine, measurement error at higher GFR, and interferences with the creatinine assays (Table A variety of confirmatory tests for GFR are available. In the general population, the 2012 KDIGO guideline suggests confirmation of GFR with either GFR estimation using cystatin C or a clearance measurement in specific circumstances when eGFR based on serum creatinine is less accurate (Box 1, 2012 CKD Recommendation 1.4.3.2). KDIGO further suggests measuring GFR using an exogenous filtration marker under circumstances where more accurate ascertainment of GFR will impact treatment decisions (Box 1, 2012 CKD Recommendation 1.4.3.8), including the evaluation of living organ donors). Based on these recommendations, the WG concluded that confirmation of GFR using the most accurate method available at the transplant center. In the United States, OPTN policy requires a clearance measurement (measured creatinine clearance [mCrCl] or mGFR) for confirmation of GFR. Many methods for mGFR determination using exogenous filtration markers and clearance calculations are available, with variable accuracy. Recommendations for specific methods are based on a recent systematic review. mGFR is not available at all centers, so other alternatives are acceptable. mCrCl is less accurate than mGFR, but it is acceptable if mGFR is not available. mCrCl overestimates mGFR due to creatinine secretion. The magnitude of overestimation is 15% or more at normal GFR, based on older data using nonstandardized serum creatinine assays. The magnitude of overestimation may be higher using standardized assays. In principle, mCrCl is available worldwide, however, in some donor candidates, mCrCl may not be available due to logistical difficulties in collecting or transporting a timed urine collection. A recent study suggests that eGFR may be sufficiently accurate for decision-making without the need for mGFR in many cases. A web-based calculator is available to compute posttest probabilities for mGFR above or below threshold probabilities for decision-making: http://ckdepi.org/equations/donor-candidate-gfr-calculator/. Post-test probabilities are computed from pretest probabilities for mGFR and test performance for eGFR using serum creatinine (eGFRcr) or the combination of creatinine and cystatin C (eGFRcr-cys). Very high posttest probabilities provide reassurance that mGFR is above the threshold level for decision-making, while very low posttest probabilities provide reassurance that mGFR is below the threshold levels for decision-making. Transplant programs can determine what posttest probabilities are sufficient for clinical decision-making in the absence of mGFR and mCrCl. One study validating these computations in donor candidates has been reported. Future studies should address prediction accuracy among racial and ethnic groups for whom the accuracy of eGFR is less certain (eg, nonblack, nonwhite persons). In general eGFRcys is not more accurate then eGFRcr; however using 2 filtration markers improves precision of GFR estimates compared with using either marker alone; thus eGFRcr-cys is generally recommended over eGFRcr or eGFRcys. Advantages of cystatin C compared with creatinine are that cystatin C is not affected by muscle mass and current equations do not require specification of race. Therefore, eGFRcys maybe more accurate than eGFRcr-cys in people with very large or very small muscle mass, very high or very low meat intake, or race-ethnicity other than black (African American or African European) or white. If cystatin C is measured, cystatin C assays should be traceable to international reference standard (which is in the early stages of implementation) and the 2012 CKD-EPI eGFRcys equation or eGFRcr-cys equation should be used unless other equations have been shown to be more accurate. If cystatin C is not available, eGFRcr can be used for decision-making. As with creatinine, sources of error in GFR estimation from serum cystatin C concentration include non\u2013steady-state conditions, nonGFR determinants of serum cystatin C, measurement error at higher GFR, and interferences with the cystatin C assays (Table Single (\u201cdivided\u201d or \u201csplit\u201d) kidney GFR can be assessed by radionuclide imaging, but is not required in all kidney donor candidates.

GFR between 60 and 89 mL/min per 1.73 m2 is considered to be decreased compared with the usual level for young adults, but does not meet the KDIGO criterion for CKD. GFR declines with age, although the cause of decline is not known and the rate of decline appears widely variable. Most data are based on cross-sectional studies, in which mean GFR is lower in older populations than in young populations. Other kidney functions are also lower in older populations (eg, renal plasma flow, maximal urinary concentration) and kidney structure is altered in older populations (eg, cortical atrophy, global glomerulosclerosis, nephrosclerosis). There is debate about whether abnormalities in kidney function and structure in older people represents normal aging or disease. Decreased GFR in the general population is associated with a higher risk of complications of CKD, including ESKD, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and death. In general populations, compared with a reference eGFR of 95 mL/min per 1.73 m2, the RR for complications related to decreased eGFR is apparent between 60 and 75 mL/min per 1.73 m2 and is exponentially higher at lower eGFR. Similar relationships of lower eGFR with adverse outcomes have been observed in subgroups including patients with known CKD (Figure KDIGO 2012 guideline defines GFR less than 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2 for 3 months or more as satisfying the criteria for CKD. GFR 15 to 30 mL/min per 1.73 m2 is defined as severely reduced, and GFR less than 15 mL/min per 1.73 m2 is defined as kidney failure. However, the association of lower eGFR with a higher risk of adverse outcomes may be related to other conditions that co-occur with low GFR, such as hypertension, diabetes and CVD. Lower GFR in older people is associated with increased risk for CKD outcomes, including ESKD, CVD and death. The RR for these outcomes in older people with lower eGFR compared with the reference eGFR is less than the RR in younger people, however the increment in absolute risk is higher in older people than in younger people. A recent meta-analysis based on data from nearly 5 million healthy persons identified from 7 general population cohorts who are similar to kidney donor candidates found that lower GFR (in the absence of donation) is associated with an increased risk for ESKD over median cohort follow-up of 4 to 16 years. After calibration to annual ESKD incidence in the US healthy population, variations in the projected 15-year and lifetime risks of ESKD based on level of eGFR were generated according to age, sex, and race for healthy persons (assuming systolic BP (SBP) 120 mm Hg, urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) 4 mg/g [0.4 mg/mmol], BMI 26 kg/m2, and absence of diabetes mellitus) (Figures 2 or greater and other optimal characteristics (see above), lifetime risk for white men and white women was less than 1% at all ages, but was higher among young black men and women (Figure 2 was less than 1% at ages older than 60 years. While these displays are useful for visualizing the impact of baseline eGFR on ESKD risk, we endorse consideration of eGFR as part of the assessment of predicted long-term ESKD risk based on a donor candidate\u2019s complete demographic and health profile (as opposed to consideration of single risk factors in isolation).", "type": "Document"}

A person with a predonation GFR of at least 90 mL/min per 1.73 m2 would be expected to have a 1-year postdonation GFR of at least 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2. In general, a donor immediately loses approximately 50% of renal mass, but there is rapid compensatory hyperfiltration leading to a net reduction in GFR of approximately 30% (25% to 40%) after donation (decrement in GFR of 25 to 40 mL/min per 1.73 m2). In prior guidelines a GFR level of 80 mL/min is frequently cited as the minimal threshold for an acceptable level of kidney function for donation. Limited data show a higher risk for lower GFR after donation among kidney donors with lower predonation GFR. (Evidence Report Table 16, SDC, http://links.lww.com/TP/B434, and Supplemental Appendix Table D13, SDC, http://links.lww.com/TP/B432). There is theoretical justification for concern about development of kidney disease after nephrectomy. In experimental animals, hemodynamic alterations associated with hyperfiltration after reduction in renal mass are followed by development of structural and functional abnormalities associated with kidney disease. In general, the severity of reduction in renal mass is directly associated with the rate of development of subsequent kidney disease. A recent study in humans documents similar hemodynamic alterations associated with hyperfiltration after kidney donation. The risk of ESKD after kidney donation does not exceed ESKD risk in the general population. An analysis of living kidney donors in the United States between 1994 and 2003 quantified a postdonation ESKD rate of 0.134 per 1000 person-years over an average follow-up of 9.8 years, which was not higher than the ESKD rate in the general population, even though GFR is lower. However, the general population is a limited comparison group given that donors undergo careful medical evaluation and selection. The ERT identified 2 recent studies suggesting that donation is associated with an increase in the risk of ESKD compared to risk in nondonors selected for baseline good health, although the risk increase is small and the absolute postdonation risk remains low (Supplemental Appendix Table D5, SDC, http://links.lww.com/TP/B432). The quality of this evidence was rated as moderate. In comparing 1901 kidney donors with 32 621 healthy, demographically matched controls, Mj\u00f8en et al reported that 0.47% of donors (n=9) developed ESKD versus 0.07% of healthy nondonors (n=22) over a median 15.2-year follow-up. Based on linking 96 217 donors from the US donor registry and healthy participants drawn from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III to national ESKD reporting forms, Muzzale et al estimated that the cumulative incidence of ESKD at 15 years was 30.8 per 10 000 in donors compared with 3.9 per 10 000 in matched donors (risk attributable to donation of 26.9 per 10 000). In this study, the incidence of ESKD was higher in individuals who are older versus younger at the time of donation, in men versus women, in blacks versus whites, and in biologically related versus unrelated donors, but risk based on predonation eGFR was not reported. Based on these findings, the likelihood of a small increase in ESKD risk should be discussed with donor candidates; such counseling is endorsed by a 2015 AST Live Donor Community of Practice consensus statement, and is required in the US by the OPTN Informed Consent Policy beginning in 2017.", "type": "Document"}

Alternatively, some guidelines recommend a GFR level within 2 standard deviations of normal for age and sex. In general, the guidelines do not specify the GFR measurement method to be used, whether the threshold value should be adjusted for BSA, or provide standardized reference values based on sex, race, and age. A 2007 survey of practices by transplant programs in the United States revealed that approximately 90% of programs used mCrCl to measure kidney function, while the other 10% of programs used the clearance of an exogenous filtration marker, and that approximately 67% of transplant programs used a threshold of 80 mL/min or more to accept donors, while 25% used a threshold based on age and sex. In our view, there is not sufficient evidence to justify a single threshold value of 80 mL/min not adjusted for BSA, nor age-specific thresholds. In contrast, our recommendations are more consistent with accepted measurement methods and thresholds in general clinical practice, and acknowledge that there is variation in GFR measurement methods and uncertainty in the appropriate threshold to accept or decline donor candidates. For this reason, we recommend GFR measurement by urinary or plasma clearance of specific exogenous filtration markers, which are known to be more accurate than mCrCl, but allow other methods. We recommend a higher threshold value of GFR (\u226590 mL/min per 1.73 m2) to routinely accept a donor candidate, and lower threshold value of GFR (<60 mL/min per 1.73 m2) to routinely decline a donor candidate, and a wide intermediate range of GFR (60-89 mL/min per 1.73 m2) in which transplant programs can individualize decisions based on other risk factors.

Increased urinary protein is generally considered a marker of kidney damage: albuminuria reflects increased permeability of the glomeruli (glomerular proteinuria), and low molecular weight proteinuria reflects decreased tubular reabsorption (tubular proteinuria). CKD due to either glomerular or tubulointerstitial diseases is generally associated with both glomerular and tubular proteinuria (albuminuria and low molecular weight proteinuria). Some tubulointerstitial diseases may cause predominantly tubular proteinuria, including Dent disease, toxicity due to heavy metals (eg, cadmium and lead) or aristolochic acid (Balkan and Chinese herb) nephropathy, Sjogren syndrome, multiple myeloma or hereditary diseases associated with Fanconi syndrome, and acute tubular necrosis. Conditions other than kidney disease can also cause proteinuria: low molecular weight proteinuria may also reflect overproduction (eg, light chain proteinuria in lymphoproliferative disorders) and high and low molecular weight proteins may arise from increased secretion of urinary tract proteins (due to lower urinary tract diseases). Urine albumin is the preferred measure of urine protein for assessment of kidney damage. Tests for total urine protein cannot be standardized because they are not traceable to a standard reference material due to the varying composition of urine protein. Current efforts to standardize albuminuria assessment are directed to establishing traceability of tests for urine albumin to standardized reference material for serum albumin. Other urine proteins are less well standardized than albumin. The albumin loss rate (hereafter referred to as albumin excretion rate, AER) is not regulated in health and is widely accepted as a marker of kidney damage.

A recent population study of 1.2 million persons aged 16 to 25 years in Israel identified prevalent asymptomatic persistent microscopic hematuria in 0.3% of individuals. Persistent microscopic hematuria may be associated with urologic abnormalities (eg, stones, tumors) or glomerular disease. The most common glomerular causes of persistent isolated microscopic hematuria are IgA nephropathy, thin basement membrane nephropathy (TBMN) and Alport syndrome. There are consensus-based guidelines for the evaluation of asymptomatic microhematuria in the general population. For example, the 2012 recommendations from the American Urological Association include assessment of risk factors for urinary tract malignancies (eg, irritative voiding symptoms, current or past tobacco use, chemical exposures), radiological evaluation (eg, multiphasic computed tomography urography, without and with intravenous contrast, or magnetic resonance urography), and cystoscopy in patients age 35 years or older regardless of history of use of anticoagulation therapy. Urine cytology and urine biomarkers are not recommended as a part of the routine evaluation of asymptomatic microhematuria. The presence of dysmorphic urinary red blood cells detected by conventional microscopy, phase-contrast microscopy, or automated analyzer has a broad a range of sensitivities (32% to 100%) and specificities (from 33% to 100%) for glomerular causes of microhematuria. The presence of dysmorphic red blood cells or cellular urinary casts and other clinical information can be used to prioritize the evaluation for glomerular causes of hematuria. However, the presence of dysmorphic red blood cells does not exclude underlying urologic disease. Although isolated microscopic hematuria in young persons is often considered \u201cbenign,\u201d a recent population-based study of 1.2 million Israeli persons aged 16 to 25 years with up to 35 years of follow-up identified small but significant increase in long-term renal risk associated with persistent asymptomatic isolated microscopic hematuria, with ESKD rates of 34.0 versus 2.05 per 100 000 person-years among those with versus without persistent microscopic hematuria (adjusted HR, 12.418.527.6). While participants were required to have serum creatinine values \u201cwithin the normal range\u201d and 24-hour urine protein less than 200 mg, this study does not provide information on ESKD risk after comprehensive evaluation and selection including measured kidney function.", "type": "Document"}

In the absence of a family history suggesting possible TBMN or Aport disease, additional testing to rule out these causes is generally not necessary. Please refer to chapter 14 for a related discussion on genetic testing in the donor candidate. Epidemiological studies of TBMN suggest increased risks of hypertension and proteinuria compared with the general population over time, but progression to ESKD is rare and thought to require an additional insult. Data on outcomes of living kidney donor evaluation and donation in persons with TBMN are limited to small series with short-term follow-up. A series of 512 consecutive donors at a US center identified asymptomatic, microscopic hematuria for at least 1 month in 2.7% (n = 14). Hematuria resolved after treatment for urinary tract infection in 2. Kidney biopsy was performed in 10/12, and showed: TBMN (5/12); normal (2/12); nonhomogeneous basement membrane abnormalities (1/12); IgA nephropathy (1/12); and greater than 20% glomerulosclerosis in a patient with a family history of Schimke's syndrome (immune-osseous dysplasia). Two of the 4 with TBMN, aged 44 and 53 years, proceeded with donation; after 15 months follow-up, donors were free of hypertension, proteinuria, and recipients had \u201cexcellent\u201d graft function. A Korean series including 5 living donors with TBMN defined by predonation biopsy reported favorable short-term outcomes, including mean serum creatinine 0.94 \u00b1 0.32 mg/dL (83 \u00b1 28.3 \u03bcmol/L) and no cases of new-onset hypertension or proteinuria over mean follow-up period of 34.7 \u00b1 42.5 months. Notably, TMBN is often defined based on pathological description rather than as a distinct clinical entity. Carrier states for Alport mutations may present as TBMN. High rates of proteinuria (75%) and ESKD (8-30%) have been reported in female carriers of X-linked Alport syndrome mutations. A recent study identified adverse kidney outcomes in 234 Alport carriers (including 29 autosomal recessive and 205 X-linked mutation carriers): ESKD developed in 17.5% at a median age of 49 years, and outcomes including ESKD, proteinuria and impaired kidney function were similar in X-linked and autosomal recessive carriers, although the number of autosomal recessive carriers was small. Among 6 female Alport carriers (5 X-linked, 1 autosomal recessive) who donated to their children at several European centers and were followed for an average 6.7 years, 3 developed new-onset hypertension and 2 developed new-onset of proteinuria. Creatinine clearance remained greater than 40 mL/min in all donors after up to 14 years. Thus, while data are limited, female carriers of X-linked Alport syndrome (ie, COL4A5 mutation) should be discouraged from kidney donation because of their own increased risk of hypertension and adverse kidney outcomes even in the absence of donation. IgA nephropathy that presents with hematuria and minimal proteinuria is often a progressive disease. In one series in Hong Kong, 72 consecutive patients with IgA nephropathy presenting as hematuria and minimal proteinuria (0.4 g/day or less) were followed for a median of 84 months; 33% developed proteinuria, 26% became hypertensive, and 7% developed impaired kidney function. The presence of hematuria and glomerular IgA deposition is associated with increased risk of progressive kidney disease even in the absence of other clinical findings. For this reason, there is broad consensus that people with known IgA nephropathy should not donate a kidney. Examination of a series of 510 implantation biopsies at a large center in Tokyo (including 446 living donors) found latent mesangial IgA deposition to be relatively common in healthy Japanese living donors, present in 16.1% of living donor allograft biopsies. Mesangial IgA deposition was associated with a mild degree of microhematuria, mesangial proliferation and glomerular macrophage infiltration in some of the affected individuals, especially with C3 deposition. Persistent hematuria without defined renal histopathology has been associated with proteinuria after kidney donation. In a series of 242 living kidney donors at one center in Japan, persistent predonation hematuria was identified in 8.3% (18.6% vs 6% in those with vs without family history of IgA nephropathy or Alport syndrome). 95% of those with persistent predonation hematuria continued to have persistent hematuria after donation over median 27 month follow-up (compared with 28% of those with predonation occasional hematuria and 5% without predonation hematuria). Predonation hematuria was associated with increased likelihood of persistent proteinuria (dipstick \u2265 1+) after donation (without dysmorphic red blood cells: adjusted OR 3.8; with dysmorphic red blood cells: adjusted OR 12.3). Predonation hematuria was not associated with postdonation GFR, but persistent postdonation hematuria with dysmorphic red blood cells was associated with significant GFR decline over the study period.", "type": "Document"}

One or more episodes of kidney stones were associated with a 2-fold higher risk of ESKD in one population-based study from Alberta, Canada. The association was stronger in patients with 2 or more episodes of kidney stones versus a single episode of kidney stones. A National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey also reported that a history of kidney stones was associated with CKD and ESKD, however the effect was largely confined to women. Among 10 678 patients in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study, nephrolithiasis history was associated with a 29% (HR, 1.071.291.54) higher risk of CKD in demographic-adjusted analyses, but the association was no longer statistically significant after multivariable adjustment (HR, 0.901.091.32;).

A decline in GFR results in less uric acid excretion and a higher serum uric acid concentration. These changes are evident with the 25% to 40% reduction in GFR that occurs after living kidney donation. For example, one prospective US cohort study found that at 6 months after nephrectomy, donors versus healthy nondonor controls had 8.2% higher serum uric acid level [mean values of 5.3 \u00b1 1.1 mg/dL (315.2 \u00b1 65.4 \u00b5mol/L; standard deviation) vs 4.9 \u00b1 1.2 mg/dL (291.5 \u00b1 71.4 \u00b5mol/L); P < 0.001], that persisted over 36 months of follow-up. Another study found donors to have 20% higher serum uric acid concentrations at a mean of 7 years after nephrectomy compared with predonation. In a study of 1988 living kidney donors from Ontario, Canada, who were followed for a median of 8.8 years (maximum, 20.8 years), living kidney donors were more likely to be diagnosed with gout compared to matched nondonors with similar baseline health, although the absolute risk remained low (3.5 vs 2.1 events per 1000 person-years; HR 1.21.62.1;). At 8 years, the cumulative incidence of gout was 1.4% higher in donors compared to nondonors (3.4% vs 2.0%). This report was not reviewed by the ERT but would be expected to have a moderate risk of bias similar to other reported outcomes from this cohort. Based on this report, some transplant teams may decide to inform donor candidates that donation is associated with an increase in serum uric acid concentration, which may increase the risk of gout. However, the authors of the primary report suggested the finding first be corroborated in other studies. In this guideline we endorse that donor candidates be asked about prior gout episodes, but given the limitations of existing information, we did not propose measuring uric acid as a standard part of evaluation or follow-up processes at this time. The risk of gout after kidney donation may vary based on demographic characteristics. A study of 4650 kidney donors from the US including 13.1% African Americans, found that, by 7 years, African Americans were almost twice as likely to develop gout as white donors (4.4% vs 2.4%; adjusted HR, 1.01.83.2). Postdonation gout risk also increased with older age at donation and was nearly 3-times higher in men compared with women. In nondonor populations hyperuricemia is associated with a higher risk of CVD and new-onset CKD. However, the prognostic significance of hyperuricemia in living kidney donors is currently uncertain and warrants additional study. In the US cohort study mentioned above, compared with matched donors without gout, donors with gout had more frequent diagnoses of acute kidney injury, CKD, and other disorders of the kidney. Donor candidates and donors with prior episodes of gout should be informed of recommended methods to reduce their risk of future episodes of gout. Previous clinical practice guidelines cite modest to low evidence for certain diet and lifestyle measures (eg, avoiding excessive alcohol, and avoiding ingestion of organ meats high in purine content) and possibly pharmacological therapies. The prevention and treatment of hyperuricemia and gout may be complicated by decreased kidney function. The dose of allopurinol, which is frequently used to treat increased serum uric acid and prevent gout, should be adjusted in patients with decreased kidney function. Dose reductions may not be necessary with newer uricosuric agents. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should probably be used cautiously in patients with decreased kidney function including living kidney donors. The treatment of choice for acute gout is colchicine, however the dose of colchicine should be reduced in patients with decreased kidney function.", "type": "Document"}

For example, one study showed that kidney donors had higher serum concentrations of fibroblast growth factor-23 and greater fractional excretion of inorganic phosphate compared with nondonor controls.

An overly small cuff will overestimate and an excessively large cuff will underestimate true BP levels. The donor candidate should be seated quietly with back supported, feet on the floor and arm supported at heart level for the measurements. It is advisable to measure BP on at least 2 separate occasions by trained staff, or on one occasion plus ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) to minimize anxiety effects in donor candidates. Automated serial BP measurements can also eliminate a \u201cwhite coat\u201d effect. Multiple prior guidelines and policies for the evaluation and care of living kidney donor candidates recommend assessment of predonation BP on several occasions, and/or consideration of ABPM in donor candidates with elevated office readings, receiving antihypertensive therapy, or who are older at evaluation. Hypertension is defined by office readings of systolic SBP of 140 mm Hg or greater or diastolic BP (DBP) of 90 mm Hg or greater, out-of-office daytime mean ABPM or home measurements of SBP of 135 mm Hg or greater or DBP of 85 mm Hg or greater, or the need for medication to control BP. Note that some antihypertensive agents may be used for indications other than BP treatment (eg, diuretics for edema or beta-blockers for migraine headache prevention), and that the indication for the prescribed medications should be determined as part of the evaluation. White coat hypertension is defined as hypertension by office BP measurements with normal out of office measurements by ABPM or home readings. Individuals with white coat hypertension have lower cardiovascular risk than persons with hypertension, but may carry increased risk for future hypertension. Population-based studies suggest that 20-25% of adults may have white coat hypertension. Individuals with treated hypertension may also have a \u201cwhite coat effect,\u201d such that elevated BP is recorded in the medical environment even when treated BP is controlled by ABPM or home readings. Masked hypertension is defined as normal BP by office measurements with hypertension by ABPM or home readings. Like sustained hypertension, masked hypertension is accompanied by increased risk for hypertensive target organ damage, and thus treatment is warranted if identified. Population-based studies suggest that 10-30% of adults may have masked hypertension. Masked hypertension cannot be identified in donor candidates in whom BP is measured by office readings alone, but the implications of requiring ABPM or home readings to screen for masked hypertension in donor candidates (eg, outcomes, cost, efficiency) are not defined.", "type": "Document"}

Nonmodifiable hypertension risk factors include a family history of hypertension, race, and age. Additional considerations include women with a history of preeclampsia or gestational hypertension. In this setting we suggest predonation counseling on the potential for increased cardiovascular risk and emphasis on healthy behaviors to reduce cardiovascular risk. Risk factors for hypertension by themselves do not constitute contraindications to donation in a normotensive person. Consistent with recommendations for the general population, British Transplantation Society and Renal Association guidelines recommend lifestyle measures in kidney donors to reduce the risk of hypertension and its consequences, including frequent exercise, smoking cessation, and weight loss where appropriate. Target organ damage may be manifest as prior occurrence of a cardiovascular event such as myocardial infarction or stroke, urine AER greater than 30 mg/d (ACR > 30 mg/g or 3 mg/mmol), reduced kidney function (eg, GFR < 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2), hypertensive retinopathy, and/or evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy. Lifestyle modification can effectively treat hypertension without medication or with fewer medications and lower dosages required to achieve BP control. Lifestyle modifications include healthy diet, smoking cessation, weight loss if overweight, regular exercise, and discontinuation of potential contributing medications according to guidelines for the general population. Follow-up of patents with hypertension is critical for monitoring of control in relation to targets and for monitoring and management of complications. The importance of access to healthcare and regular follow-up have also been emphasized in the selection and care of hypertensive donor candidates in 2 prior guidelines, whereas the Spanish Society of Nephrology and Spanish National Transplant Organisation guidelines specify \u201creasonable guarantee that the donor will follow the check-up period and treatment indefinitely\u201d among the criteria for acceptance of a hypertensive donor candidate.", "type": "Document"}

While it is documented that BP often rises with aging, GFR reduction from kidney donation may accelerate the risk or progression of hypertension over time to a greater extent than expected from normal aging, possibly due to physiological alterations (eg, hyperfiltration in the remaining kidney, changes in vascular tone and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone regulation) and/or heightened detection at donor follow-up. Existing retrospective studies examining the impact of kidney donation on hypertension risk have been limited by short follow-up times, high rates of loss to follow-up, lack of controls and/or comparisons to unselected general rather than healthy populations. Use of antihypertensive medications was lower in a cohort of privately-insured donors compared with age- and sex-matched unscreened beneficiaries in the same insurance plan. In contrast, a systematic review including data for 5145 predominantly white donors estimated 6 mm Hg higher weighted mean SBP and 4 mm Hg higher weighted mean DBP in donors compared with controls after an average of 7 years (Supplemental Appendix Tables D1 and D2, SDC, http://links.lww.com/TP/B432). An administrative claims linkage study of 1278 (primarily white race) living donors in Ontario, Canada followed for a mean of 6 years (range, 1-16 years) found a higher incidence of claims-based hypertension diagnoses (16.3% vs 11.9%; HR, 1.21.41.7) among living donors compared with matched controls who were also screened for the absence of baseline comorbidities through administrative claims. Among more recent donor cohorts, higher rates of postdonation hypertension and antihypertensive medication use in African American compared with white donors have been reported. While these patterns parallel hypertension prevalence differences in the general population, one small study found higher rates of postdonation hypertension among 103 African American donors compared with race-matched \u201chealthy\u201d nondonor controls (41% vs 18% at an average of 6.8 years postdonation) (Supplemental Appendix Table D10, SDC, http://links.lww.com/TP/B432). Furthermore, many donors in this study were unaware of their hypertension. Associations of age at donation and sex with postdonation hypertension have been inconsistent (Supplemental Appendix Tables D7 and D9, SDC, http://links.lww.com/TP/B432). Based on these data, we suggest that donor candidates should be informed that BP may rise with aging, and that donation may accelerate the rise in BP and the need for antihypertensive treatment over that expected with normal aging, especially if BP is high-normal before donation and among African American donor candidates. Furthermore, antihypertensive medication is more likely to be prescribed after donation.", "type": "Document"}

The ERT identified 3 studies, rated as very low quality in reporting postdonation outcomes according to predonation BP or hypertension status (Evidence Report Table 19, SDC, http://links.lww.com/TP/B434, and Supplemental Appendix Table D16, SDC, http://links.lww.com/TP/B432). In a combined cohort of donors and matched healthy nondonors in Norway, each 1 mm Hg increase in SBP was associated with a small increase in cardiovascular death and ESKD during up to 25 years of follow-up. A study of only 6 hypertensive donors reported CKD in 4 (67%) compared with 22% of nonhypertensive donors during an average of 5.4 years follow-up. A third study of 16 hypertensive donors was deemed at high risk of bias.

Additional studies that did not meet criteria for the ERT evidence review include a large study based on linkage of the US Transplant Registry with national death records that found higher perioperative mortality among donors with versus without predonation hypertension (36.7 vs 1.3 per 10 000). While reported baseline hypertension was not associated with long-term mortality, SBP of 140 mm Hg or greater at donor registration was associated with 3-times the adjusted RR of death over 12 years compared to SBP less than 120 mm Hg (adjusted HR 1.13.39.7).

Some of the factors considered do not have currently known associations with ESKD risk, but are relevant to a comprehensive predonation health assessment. Even if donation does not increase the risk, traditional CVD risk factors are expected to have at least the same effect in donors as in the general population. Attention to these risk factors is intended to prevent or delay the onset and progression of comorbid diseases, kidney disease, and CVD. All risk factors considered in this section are potentially modifiable by lifestyle and/or medical care. According to World Health Organization (WHO), the prevalence of diabetes mellitus increased from 108 million people worldwide in 1980 to 422 million in 2014. The rising prevalence of diabetes is linked with the obesity epidemic and 2.1 billion adults worldwide were estimated to be overweight or obese in 2013. Underlying causes of the obesity epidemic may be modifiable, and include sedentary lifestyles, high-fat and energy-dense diets, and increased urbanization. The WHO defines obesity based on thresholds of BMI, a measure of weight scaled for height, as: underweight (<18.5 kg/m2), normal weight (18.5-24.9 kg/m2), overweight (25-29.9 kg/m2), obese (30-34.9 kg/m2), and morbidly obese (>35 kg/m2). While BMI is recognized to be an imperfect measure of body composition, the components of BMI are easily measured, recorded, and followed over time, and have prognostic implications. Optimal BMI-based thresholds for obesity may differ from WHO standards in non-whites, and race-specific thresholds have been proposed. Measurement of waist circumference and/or waist-to-hip ratios may also be considered to characterize the distribution of adiposity in obese persons. Multiple prior guidelines and policies for the evaluation and care of living donors recommend measurement of fasting plasma glucose and consideration of oral glucose tolerance testing and/or glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) as part of the donor evaluation. The WHO defines diabetes mellitus as: fasting plasma glucose of 7.0 mmol/L or greater (\u2265126 mg/dL), random plasma glucose of 11.1 mmol/L or greater (\u2265200 mg/dL), or plasma glucose concentration of 11.1 mmol/L or greater (\u2265200 mg/dL) 2 hours after a 75-g anhydrous glucose load in an oral glucose tolerance test. A 2011 addendum included recognition of HbA1c of 48 mmol/mol or greater (6.5%) as an additional criterion for diagnosing diabetes if assays are standardized to criteria aligned with international reference values, but also indicated that HbA1c less than 48 mmol/mol (6.5%) does not exclude diabetes diagnosed using glucose tests. The WHO defines Impaired Glucose Tolerance as fasting plasma glucose less than 7.0 mmol/L (<126 mg/dL) or 2-hour post\u2013load plasma glucose of 7.8 or greater and less than 11.1 mmol/L (\u2265140 and < 200 mg/dL), while Impaired Fasting Glucose is defined as fasting plasma glucose 6.1 to 6.9 mmol/L (110 to 125 mg/dL) or 2-hour post\u2013load plasma glucose less than 7.8 mmol (<140 mg/dL). Currently there are various definitions of prediabetes and the equivalent term used by WHO, intermediate hyperglycemia, is defined by fasting plasma glucose of 6.1 to 6.9 mmol/L (110-125 mg/dL) and 1-hour post\u2013load plasma glucose of 7.8-11.0 mmol/L (140-199 mg/dL). Dyslipidemias are classified based on elevations in total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and low concentrations of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Hypertriglyceridemia is an independent CVD risk factor.", "type": "Document"}

The ERT report identified 2 systematic reviews that examined perioperative outcomes after donor nephrectomy according to BMI, with quality of source studies rated as low. Among 8 studies reporting operative time, all but one found a modest increase in operative time (mean difference of 16.9 minutes) among donors with BMI of 30 or greater compared to those with BMI less than 30 kg/m2 (Supplemental Appendix Table C7, SDC, http://links.lww.com/TP/B432). While warm ischemia times were reported to be longer for obese donors in all but one study, this difference was not significant on meta-analysis. Pooled results showed no differences in blood loss or length of stay among obese compared with normal weight donors. In the general population, obesity has been identified as a risk factor for diabetes mellitus and it may also be a risk factor for kidney disease, particularly obesity-related glomerulopathy. The ERT identified 5 studies comparing long-term outcomes among donors by predonation BMI, rated as low quality, with follow-up ranging from 6.7 to 15.1 years (Supplemental Appendix Table D12, SDC, http://links.lww.com/TP/B432). One study found that BMI was associated with cardiovascular mortality but not all-cause mortality. In contrast, another registry study found no association between BMI and death over 12 years. A few studies of variable quality examined associations between BMI and intermediate outcomes. Multiple prior guidelines for the evaluation and care of living kidney donor candidates recommend BMI greater than 35 kg/m2 as an absolute or relative contraindication to donation. and other guidelines recommend careful evaluation for other comorbidities in donor candidates with BMI greater than 30 kg/m2. With regard to other metrics of obesity aside from BMI, the Spanish Society of Nephrology and Spanish National Transplant Organisation guidelines define waistline greater than 82 cm in women or greater than 102 cm in men as additional relative contraindications to donation. CARI guidelines advise measurement of waist circumference within the assessment of overweight and obese donor candidates, and a US Joint Societies work group consensus statement includes abdominal circumference as part of the definition of metabolic syndrome. In contrast, the ERT concluded that there is limited evidence from the donor population to make recommendations for donor acceptance based on BMI alone among obese donor candidates.

Findings from the recent US study suggests more uncertainty when drawing inferences about long-term postdonation risk in obese donor candidates, and the need to develop individualized postdonation risk estimates according to demographic and health profile. Acceptance thresholds for donor candidate BMI can incorporate perinephrectomy complications along with long-term risks of ESKD and other complications as data become available. We agree with prior recommendations that obese donor candidate should be counseled about the long-term risks of obesity, advised to pursue weight loss before donation, and to maintain a healthy body weight after donation.", "type": "Document"}

A recent meta-analysis based on data from nearly 5 million persons identified from 7 general population cohorts found that, compared with nondiabetic persons, those with type 2 diabetes but otherwise good health had 3-times the risk of ESKD over median cohort follow-up of 4 to 16 years (adjusted HR, 1.913.014.74).

The WG considers that older candidates with type 2 diabetes with well-controlled glycemia, not requiring insulin and without end-organ damage, might be considered for donation. Prediabetes represents an intermediate category of hyperglycemia, which poses increased risks for future type 2 diabetes mellitus and CVD. Important risk factors for diabetes and prediabetes in the general population include increasing age, high-risk ethnicity or race, obesity, and history of diabetes in a first degree relative. Approximately 5-10% of individuals with prediabetes progress to diabetes per year but the risk of progression can be reduced with lifestyle changes and weight loss. The younger the individual with risk factors for prediabetes, the higher the likelihood that diabetes and subsequent kidney disease will develop in that person\u2019s remaining lifetime. A small cohort study found that carefully screened prediabetic living kidney donors may revert to normal fasting glucose and did not have an increased risk of impaired kidney function in the short term (Evidence Report Table 17, SDC, http://links.lww.com/TP/B434; Supplemental Appendix Table D14, SDC, http://links.lww.com/TP/B432). However, quality of this study was very low. A recent study linking US national donor registry data to ESKD registry data for 125 427 living donors examined causes of ESKD after donation. The finding that early postdonation ESKD was predominantly reported as due to glomerulonephritis while late postdonation ESKD was more frequently reported as diabetic-ESKD and hypertensive-ESKD could be consistent with an effect of donation on diabetes and hypertension as causes for ESKD. These findings emphasize the importance of counseling donor candidates with prediabetes regarding their increased lifetime risk for progression to diabetes and subsequent end-organ complications, and the importance of healthy lifestyle behaviors to reduce risks. Those who are approved to donate should be counseled on the importance of regular medical follow-up after donation including surveillance for hyperglycemia and kidney function for many decades after donation, and prompt institution of appropriate management. Prior recommendations regarding candidacy of persons with prediabetes for kidney donation are conflicting.

The risk of death-censored major cardiovascular events was similar among donors and nondonors (1.7 vs 2.0 events per 1000 person-years).

Continued study is needed to assess the impact of donation on long-term survival in large, representative cohorts. Limited data are available on the impact of donation on the pathophysiology of CVD. The Chronic Renal Impairment in Birmingham (CRIB)-Donor study included 68 donors at 2 United Kingdom centers (2011 to 2014), of whom 90% were white, and prospectively examined changes in left ventricular mass and other CVD surrogate markers at 12 months postdonation versus predonation, compared with changes in these parameters in healthy nondonors.

Donor-derived infections can be classified as \u201cexpected\u201d versus \u201cunexpected.\u201d The risks of \u201cexpected\u201d donor-derived infection transmission are defined by donor and recipient screening, such as in high-risk scenarios for transmission of cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) or toxoplasmosis from a seropositive donor to a seronegative recipient. \u201cExpected\u201d transmissions occur frequently and are managed by surveillance and/or prophylaxis strategies in the recipient after transplantation. \u201cUnexpected\u201d donor-derived infections arise despite routine donor screening, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) transmission due to false negative serologic testing or infection in a \u201cwindow period.\u201d The 2013 US Public Health Service (PHS) Guideline provides an evidence-based instrument to screen for behavioral factors associated with recent HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), or HCV infection (Table \u201cUnexpected\u201d infectious disease transmissions through organ transplantation are rare, but may result in serious morbidity and mortality.

The risk of donor-derived disease transmission can be mitigated by the donor evaluation, including history taking (clinical, social/behavioral, travel) and microbiological testing. While microbiological testing should be performed in all donors for some pathogens [HIV, HBV, HCV, CMV, EBV, syphilis], focusing testing for other pathogens based on regional epidemiology and individual clinical, social or geographic risk factors should reduce the likelihood of procuring an organ that could transmit infection, while preserving opportunities for donation (avoiding false-positive test results) (Table as discussed according to specific pathogen below.

Regardless of past risk factors, all donor candidates should undergo testing for HCV infection as close as possible to the date of the organ recovery, but within no longer than 28 days before donation.

In contrast to undetected donor disease transmission, medical advancements in HIV antiviral therapy have led to consideration of planned kidney transplantation from HIV+ donors to HIV+ recipients, such as recent experience described in South Africa.

However, seroconversion requires the elaboration of antibodies against a specific pathogen and could be delayed for several weeks after infectious exposure. Testing during the window period for seroconversion may generate false-negative test results and could lead to inadvertent infection transmissions. Cases of donor-derived infection transmissions related to window period infections missed by serologic screening of donors have been reported. The period from HIV exposure to the development of HIV antibodies is 22 days on average, but can be up to 6 months. HBsAg enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) have a window period of 38.3 to 49.7 days, while the time from HBV exposure to positive NAT testing ranges from 20.4 to 25.7 days. The window period for detection of HCV infection by ELISA is 38 to 94 days, but the duration of the window is substantially reduced to 6.1 to 8.7 days by the use of NAT. In 2007 in the United States, a previously uninfected deceased donor kidney transplant recipient tested positive for HIV and HCV infection. Routine donor serologic screening for HIV and HCV infection was negative; the donor's only known risk factor for HIV was having sex with another man. Four organs (2 kidneys, liver and heart) were transplanted to 4 recipients. NAT of donor sera and posttransplant sera from all recipients were positive for HIV and HCV. This case highlighted the potential for donors to harbor HIV and HCV infection during the window period, when infection cannot be detected by antibody screening. In 2009, a case of unexpected HIV transmission from a living organ donor in New York City was also reported. Based on this case, it was suggested that to reduce the risk for transmission of HIV through living donor organ transplantation, transplant programs should screen living donors for HIV as close to the time of organ recovery as possible, using sensitive tests for both chronic and acute infections, namely, antibody and NAT testing. In 2013, the US PHS updated their \u201cGuideline for Reducing HIV, HBV and HCV Transmission through Organ Transplantation,\u201d including recommended risk factor assessment in all donor candidates (Table Living donor candidates with behaviors associated with increased risk of acquiring HIV, HBV or HCV identified during evaluation should receive individualized counseling on specific strategies to prevent exposure to these viruses during the period before donation surgery. Recommendations regarding microbiological testing include: All potential organ donors (living or deceased) should be tested for antibodies to HIV (ie, anti-HIV 1/2 Ab or HIV antigen/antibody [Ag/Ab] combination assay). All potential organ donors identified as being at increased risk for HIV infection should also be tested for HIV RNA by NAT or HIV antigen (eg, HIV Ag/Ab combination assay). Donor blood specimens should be obtained before procurement. Ab or Ag/Ab test results should be made available before transplantation.All potential organ donors (living or deceased) should be tested for both anti-HCV Ab and for HCV RNA by NAT. Donor blood specimens should be obtained before procurement. Antibody test results should be made available before transplantation.All potential organ donors (living or deceased) should be tested for anti-HBcAb and for HBsAg. Donor blood specimens should be obtained before procurement. Ag/Ab test results should be made available before transplantation.As noted above, the guideline recommends that all living donor candidates should be tested for HIV, HBV and HCV as close as possible to the date of the organ recovery operation, but within no longer than 28 days before surgery. Whether retesting closer to the time of transplantation (eg, within 7 to 10 days before donation) is warranted to detect new infections and reduce the window period, overall or among high-risk donor candidates, remains controversial.

In the United States, all assays currently FDA-approved for detecting evidence of T. pallidum infection in organ and tissue donors are serologic assays. There are 2 types of serologic assays: nontreponemal and treponemal. Nontreponemal assays use a combination of cardiolipin, cholesterol, and other lipid substances released from damaged cells as the antigenic source to detect antibodies against cardiolipin, which circulates in the sera of individuals infected with syphilis and may also be present in individuals with a variety of other conditions. Reactivity to cardiolipin generally disappears within a year or 2 after successful treatment of syphilis. Treponemal assays detect T. pallidum antibodies, which tend to remain elevated for life. Therefore, treponemal assays cannot distinguish between recent, remote, and previously treated infection. Donors are screened for serological evidence of syphilis with a nontreponemal assay such as the rapid plasma reagin (RPR) or venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) test, which should be confirmed later with a treponemal Ab immunoassay. A recent study found that current screening of deceased organ donors by RPR yields a significant number of false-positive results. Use of alternative tests or the routine use of confirmatory tests may reduce the frequency of false-positive syphilis results in potential deceased and living organ donors. As there are multiple available syphilis assays providing different types of information, no single blood assay can conclusively define an individual\u2019s disease status. For donor candidate testing, specimen collection and the time available to perform testing must be considered in choosing an appropriate donor screening assay. Living donor candidate evaluation is less time constrained than the screening of deceased donors, and thus screening with nontreponemal assays followed by confirmation with treponemal assays is preferred if feasible. Transmission of syphilis has been reported in the United Kingdom to 2 recipients from a deceased donor with a past history of treated disease, supporting recommendations of penicillin for treatment of recipients of deceased donor organs from serologically reactive donors.

Other viral, fungal, bacterial and parasitic pathogens recognized as sources of organ donor-derived infection transmissions are listed in Table Strongyloidiasis typically occurs only in the setting of specific environmental exposures. Donor-derived Strongyloides hyperinfection cases with high associated mortality have been reported, including from kidney transplantation. Consensus-based recommendations of the 2013 AST Infectious Diseases Community of Practice work group and the OPTN Ad Hoc Disease Transmission Advisory Committee (DTAC) support screening for Strongyloides in the following potential organ donors: Persons who were born in or lived in tropical or subtropical countries where sanitation conditions are substandard, including candidates with prior military service in endemic areas. The WHO emphasizes a correlation between improved sanitation and human waste disposal with the disappearance of Strongyloidiasis. Strongyloidiasis has occurred in most countries with the exception of Canada, Japan and Northern Europe.Persons with significant exposure to soil in Appalachia or the Southeastern United States, including walking barefoot.Persons with unexplained eosinophilia and travel to endemic area.Persons reporting a prior history of Strongyloides infection. Serologic Ab testing is the preferred screening test for Strongyloides infection, as the sensitivity of stool testing is limited and multiple stool screening tests may be negative in asymptomatic chronic infection. Strongyloides IgG antibody testing (ELISA-based) is available in many reference labs. Infected donor candidates should be treated with a minimum of 2 doses of ivermectin before donation (200 \u00b5g/kg orally daily on 2 consecutive days) Because of the potential for persistence of migrating larvae and eggs in the tissues, some experts recommend repeating this treatment 2 weeks later to cover an autoinfection cycle. After treatment, follow-up laboratory testing of the donor candidate before donation to confirm cure has been deemed unnecessary, unless reexposure has occurred Chagas disease is transmitted through contact with infected triatomine \u201ckissing\u201d bugs, and residents of poorly constructed housing where these insects reside are at greatest risk of acquiring infection. Transmission has also been reported from mother to infant, through blood transfusion, and through organ transplantation. Consensus-based recommendations of the 2011 Chagas in Transplant Working Group, the 2013 AST Infectious Diseases Community of Practice work group, and OPTN DTAC support screening in the following potential organ donors: Those who were born in or lived in an endemic region in Mexico, Central or South AmericaChildren of women who lived in endemic regions and whose T. cruzi infection status is positive or unknownPersons who received a blood transfusion in endemic regionsPersons reporting a prior history of Chagas disease Assessment of outcomes of 32 transplant recipients who received organs from 14 T. cruzi seropositive donors in the United States from 2001 to 2011 confirmed transmission in 9 recipients from 6 donors, including 2 of 15 (13%) kidney recipients, 2 of 10 (20%) liver recipients and 3 of 4 (75%) heart recipients. Recommended monitoring posttransplant comprised regular testing by polymerase chain reaction, hemoculture, and serologic testing. Thirteen recipients had no or incomplete monitoring; transmission was confirmed in 5 of these recipients; 4 of the 5 recipients had symptomatic disease and all 4 died, although death was directly related to Chagas disease in only one. Nineteen recipients had partial or complete monitoring for T. cruzi infection with weekly testing by polymerase chain reaction, hemoculture and serologic testing; transmission was confirmed in 4 of the 19 recipients with no cases of symptomatic disease. Based on such evidence, recent guidelines support consideration of kidney donation from donors with T. cruzi infection on an individual basis with consent of the recipient. Recipients must be informed of the need for participation in close monitoring and the available therapeutic interventions in the event of infection, as the medications available for treatment are not FDA-approved and are generally only available through specific protocols. Consideration of the recipient\u2019s access to testing and monitoring is imperative, as geographic concerns may impact the ability to follow the recipient closely. West Nile Virus is a flavivirus that is transmitted by mosquitoes in an enzootic cycle with birds. When testing is indicated, screening living donor candidates by West Nile virus NAT within 7 to 14 days of donation has been recommended. Proposed strategies for when to begin testing living donor candidates for West Nile virus include when regional blood banks start performing NAT screening or testing during a defined period of time that reflects the peak of local West Nile virus infection. The 2013 AST Infectious Diseases Community of Practice work group recommended delaying donation for 28 days when NAT screening is positive, followed by repeat NAT and immunoglobulin M (IgM) Ab testing with the following management pathways based on the results: NAT+: Defer donation for at least 120 days. Donation deemed likely to be safe if clearance of viremia demonstrated by NAT testing after 120 daysNAT-/IgM Ab\u2212: Consider initial NAT testing to reflect a false positive result.

A recent systematic review examined all case reports, case series and registry studies describing the outcomes of kidney transplant recipients with donor-derived cancer transmission published through December 2012. Among 104 donor-transmitted cancer cases identified from 69 studies, the most common transmitted cancer types were renal cancer (n = 20, 19%), followed by melanoma (n = 18, 17%), lymphoma (n = 15, 14%) and lung cancer (n = 9, 9%). Recipients with transmitted renal cancers had the best outcomes, with more than 70% of recipients surviving for at least 24 months after transplantation. Patients with melanoma and lung cancers had the worst prognosis, with less than 50% of recipients surviving beyond 24 months from transplantation. While these data support that donor-derived cancer transmission is uncommon, potential reporting-bias prevents accurate incidence estimates. This report highlights the high mortality associated with donor-derived melanoma and lung cancer transmission. A history of melanoma is particularly concerning when evaluating a living donor candidate. Aside from the potential for late recurrence and subsequent complications in the donor, melanoma transmission to transplant recipients has been reported after apparent dormancy in the donor for decades, supporting the ability of melanoma cells to remain dormant at distant sites for decades and then reactivate upon exposure to immunosuppression, and transmission can be fatal. The Israel Penn International Transplant Tumor Registry, a voluntary registry of more than 250 cases of organs transplanted from donors with a history of malignancy that captures tumor histology, donor risk factors, method of tumor presentation and recipient outcome, described 13 donors with a history of melanoma (but deemed free of the disease at donation) who provided organs to 28 recipients. Melanoma transmission occurred in 21 recipients (75%), of whom 13 (62%) died from metastatic disease. The time to diagnosis ranged from 2.5 to 42 months (median, 10.5 months), and the only patients who survived were those who underwent nephrectomy and cessation of immunosuppression. While some prior general population guidelines such as the US Preventative Services Task Force state that there is insufficient evidence to recommend routine whole body skin exam screening among general adults, skin examinations for donor candidates with increased recreational or occupational exposure to sunlight, family or personal history of skin cancer, or clinical evidence of precursor lesions may be warranted.

In a matched cohort study of 2119 donors in Ontario Canada (1992-2010) and 21 190 nondonors from the general population with similar baseline health, no living kidney donor in the cohort received a partial or total nephrectomy of their remaining kidney during follow-up. The decision to approve donation in a person with kidney cysts depends on radiographic characteristics (Tables Based on review of cancer registry reports, published literature and disease transmission cases reported to the OPTN, a 2011 OPTN DTAC Malignancy Subcommittee concluded, from a disease-transmission perspective, that \u201c\u2026 kidneys with small, solitary, well differentiated renal cell carcinoma may be usable for transplantation provided the lesion itself is completely resected.\" While partial (rather than complete) nephrectomy is often the treatment choice for small renal cell carcinomas for the purpose of nephron-sparing with comparable cure rates in affected individuals, persons planning kidney donation intend to undergo complete nephrectomy.

A family history of a genetic kidney disease with an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance (such as cystinosis or some forms of familial FSGS) is usually not a contraindication for living kidney donation, although long-term follow-up data are not available in the literature. All donor candidates should be asked detailed questions about a possible family history of hereditary kidney disease, and all reasonable measures should be taken by health professionals caring for the intended recipient to determine the cause of kidney failure in the setting of possible hereditary kidney disease. With permission of the intended recipient, information about the intended recipient\u2019s cause of kidney failure should be reviewed carefully by the donor evaluation team and shared with the donor candidate if it could affect the decision to donate. Some donor candidates have a family history of genetic kidney disease. Some of these diseases first manifest later in life and are not identified when donor evaluation occurs at a younger age. Donation could increase the lifetime risk of kidney failure in such a candidate. For this reason, it is important that transplant programs have a strategy for evaluating for inherited kidney disease in donor candidates when there is a family history of kidney failure and the recipient\u2019s cause of kidney failure is uncertain. Many of the standard tests done as part of the donor evaluation should be interpreted with special consideration in the setting of a family history of genetic kidney disease. Examples include renal imaging in the setting of family history of ADPKD, or hematuria testing in the setting of a family history of Alport syndrome (see also chapter 7). Ideally, the estimation of long-term postdonation risk in a donor candidate should account for their family history of genetic kidney disease, but there are currently no tools that incorporate family history of genetic kidney disease with a donor candidate\u2019s other demographic and health characteristics to estimate long-term risk. Living donors who are biologically related versus unrelated to a recipient may have a higher incidence of ESKD. In a large study from the United States, the 15-year cumulative incidence of ESKD was 0.34% in living donors who were biologically related to a recipient versus 0.15% in unrelated donors (a two-fold increase in relative terms, although difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.15). Donor candidates must provide informed consent to have genetic testing if indicated as part of their evaluation. Donor candidates should be informed of the possible effects of receiving a diagnosis of a genetic kidney disease, such as any effects on their ability to obtain health or life insurance. In cases where despite a normal evaluation at the time of donor candidate evaluation it remains uncertain whether the candidate has a genetic kidney disease, donation should proceed only after a full discussion with the donor candidate of the risks of donation if the disease manifests later in life. With advances in genetic medicine and the implications of new risk alleles such as APOL1, there is likely to be rapidly evolving knowledge that may influence future donor candidate evaluations. However, at this time the testing for several genetic conditions is imperfect. This uncertainty should prompt a discussion with all relevant stakeholders to achieve consensus on proceeding with donation or not.", "type": "Document"}

Age-dependent imaging criteria for diagnosis and disease exclusion have been established for at-risk adults with unknown ADPKD gene type (PKD1 or PKD2). For example, for candidates 40 years or older with a first degree relative with ADPKD, the finding of normal kidneys or a single cyst seen in one kidney with no cysts seen in the other kidney reliably rules out the presence of ADPKD. However, the utility of ultrasound to rule out ADPKD in younger donor candidates is more limited, where an absent or limited number of cysts on CT or MRI can be considered to rule out ADPKD. DNA testing can also sometimes help diagnose or exclude the condition. Linkage-based genetic diagnoses of ADPKD using polymorphic markers flanking the 2 disease genes is now rarely performed. Rather, direct mutation screening (by Sanger or next-generation sequencing) is now commonly used for molecular diagnosis of ADPKD. Up to 15% of patients with suspected ADPKD have a negative comprehensive mutation screen. The first-degree relative with ADPKD should undergo PKD1 and PKD2 mutation screening (using an acceptable technique), and if a pathogenic mutation is successfully identified, the donor candidate can be tested for this same mutation. However, when mutation screening in the first-degree relative with ADPKD is negative, DNA testing including molecular diagnostics is unhelpful in determining whether the donor candidate does or does not have ADPKD. The criteria to diagnose ADPKD in patients with no family history of ADPKD is less certain (a family history is absent in 10-15% of patients with ADPKD). A patient with bilaterally enlarged kidneys with innumerable cysts most likely has ADPKD, although the presence of other cystic kidney diseases should also be considered.", "type": "Document"}

Recent literature supports that at least a portion of kidney failure previously attributed to hypertensive nephrosclerosis or other diseases (eg, FSGS, lupus nephritis, HIV nephropathy, sickle cell disease) in persons of African descent may be genetically mediated or accelerated by coding variants in the APOL1 gene. Having at least one APOL1 risk allele confers resistance to lethal Trypanosoma brucei infections, and these variant alleles are observed in populations of African descent but essentially absent among white persons. Regionally, APOL1 risk variants are common in persons from West Africa and South Africa (sub-Saharan African descent), and uncommon in North Africa. Approximately 13% of African Americans carry 2 APOL1 risk alleles. Among African Americans in the general population, carrying 2 APOL1 risk alleles has been associated with FSGS and HIV-associated nephropathy histopathologies, proteinuria, reduced GFR, younger age at dialysis and more rapid progression of kidney disease. The presence of 2 APOL1 risk alleles in a deceased donor associates with 2-to-4-times higher RR of graft loss in the recipient, compared with 0 or 1 risk alleles. Case reports of possible APOL1-mediated adverse donor and recipient outcomes after living kidney donation among siblings of African ancestry were recently described. Routine use of APOL1 genotyping and related counseling within evaluation protocols has been advocated by some, while others raise concerns. The utility of APOL1 testing has not been addressed in prior living donor guidelines. The impact of APOL1 screening on donor candidate exclusion, and the impact of test results on postdonation outcomes and graft outcomes in living donor transplant recipients are yet to be defined. Nevertheless, given APOL1-related risks identified in the general population and among deceased donor transplant recipients, as well as known higher risk of renal complications among African American compared with white donors, we recommend considering APOL1 genotyping in donor candidates with sub-Saharan African ancestors. The implications of having 2 APOL1 risk alleles likely differ in younger versus older donor candidates, and whether the genetically related intended recipient has the same alleles. The implications of having 2 APOL1 risk alleles may also be influenced by the results of kidney function testing done at the time of donor candidate evaluation. A 2016 AST Expert Conference opined that pending more evidence, at this time all African American living donor candidates should be informed about the associations of APOL1 risk alleles with CKD/ESKD risk in the general population and offer genetic testing as part of the evaluation (including coverage of testing costs) to candidates who wish to know their APOL1 status. The WG also recommended counseling donor candidates that precise ESKD risk for an affected individual cannot currently be quantified, and that genetic testing may post psychological stress. Finally, the authors advised that use of APOL1 risk allele status should be integrated with the donor candidate\u2019s full profile of demographic and health characteristics in determining donor candidacy.", "type": "Document"}

Collagen is an important structural component of the basement membranes in the kidney, inner ear and eye, and the clinical manifestations of Alport syndrome include persistent microscopic hematuria, early onset bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, and ocular anterior lenticonus and retinal flecks. The combination of a detailed family history assessment and a kidney biopsy helps establish the diagnosis, where electron microscopy demonstrates areas of irregular glomerular basement membrane thickness with lamellation, splitting and sometimes characteristic \u201cbasket-weave appearances.\u201d The presence of Alport syndrome can be confirmed by genetic testing, and next-generation sequence panels provide opportunities to genetically screen for collagen mutations. Alport syndrome is primarily an X-linked disorder (approximately 80% of families), but can also be inherited in an autosomal recessive (approximately 15% of families) and autosomal dominant fashion (very rare). Most women who are heterozygotes for X-linked Alport syndrome exhibit hematuria (95% of women in one European cohort). Of note, collagen (COL4A) mutations are present in families with Alport syndrome (85% of Alport syndrome is caused by mutations of COL4A5), and are also present in some families with familial FSGS, sporadic FSGS, and thin basement membrane disease. Overall, the severity of nephropathy in Alport syndrome is variable. Many males with X-linked Alport syndrome will develop ESKD before the age of 40 years. Most female carriers of X-linked Alport syndrome will not develop kidney failure in their lifetime although cases of ESKD do occur. There is little information on the outcomes of such heterozygotes who proceeded with kidney donation (after confirming the absence of proteinuria, hypertension, low GFR and other manifestations of the disease such as sensorineural hearing loss). Gross et al described 6 mothers with Alport syndrome (across several European centers) who donated kidneys to their children with the disease. Five mothers with X-linked Alport syndrome donated to their sons and one mother who was a carrier of autosomal recessive Alport syndrome donated to her daughter; kidney function declined 25% to 60% in 4 of the 6 donors over the observed 2 to 14 years after nephrectomy, although no donor's creatinine clearance was less than 40 mL/min at the time of follow-up evaluation; 4 of the 6 developed microalbuminuria or proteinuria, and hypertension was diagnosed in 4 of 6 donors. There are often several considerations in evaluating a mother with X-linked Alport syndrome for donation to a son with kidney failure, including her desire to care for her child and the possible guilt associated with passing on a genetic kidney disease. Alternative treatment options should be considered (including other living donors), as should the age of the woman (older women have had more time to manifest kidney disease, so normal testing at the time of their evaluation is more reassuring than similar results in a younger woman).", "type": "Document"}

This information has implications for counseling and the need to confirm the absence of pregnancy at the time of donor nephrectomy. When evaluating donor candidates, knowledge about a prior history of hypertensive disorder during pregnancy and its severity is important, as when such a history is present (vs absent) it is associated with a higher risk of ESKD. One meta-analysis concluded that women were at greater risk of albuminuria after a preeclamptic pregnancy compared with a normal pregnancy (5- to 10-year incidence of 31% vs 7%). This meta-analysis was, however, restricted by small studies of variable quality that focused often on women with severe preeclampsia or underlying diseases such as diabetes mellitus. A population-based study from Norway suggested that women were at greater risk of ESKD if they developed preeclampsia during pregnancy than if they did not (approximate 30-year cumulative incidence after a woman\u2019s first pregnancy of 0.4% vs 0.1%) The risk remained evident after excluding women with a prepregnancy history of known kidney disease, diabetes or hypertension. A study from Taiwan also described a greater risk of ESKD in pregnant women who developed a hypertensive disorder during pregnancy compared with a normal pregnancy (approximate 12-year cumulative incidence after pregnancy of 0.6% vs < 0.1%) In general, characteristics associated with a lower long-term risk of ESKD after a history of hypertension in pregnancy include: i) a mild (vs severe) hypertensive event during pregnancy; ii) more than 10 years since last hypertension event in pregnancy; iii) no evidence of hypertension, albuminuria or low GFR in the current donor evaluation; and iv) no wish for future pregnancies. Gestational diabetes is a strong risk factor for subsequent diabetes mellitus. A history of gestational diabetes mellitus is also associated with a higher risk of ESKD. For recommendations related to gestational diabetes see Recommendations 11.5 and 11.7. Because a fetus may be harmed by radiation and/or or radiocontrast, local guidelines should be followed to confirm the absence of pregnancy before performing certain tests as part of the donor candidate evaluation, such as an abdominal CT (with iodinated contrast) or a nuclear GFR test. Some guidelines suggest that it may be reasonable to proceed without a quantitative human chorionic gonadotropin (\u03b2-hCG) pregnancy test if a woman\u2019s menstrual period is not overdue and there is an absence of pregnancy symptoms. A woman should not donate while pregnant. Women with childbearing potential should be informed about the need to avoid becoming pregnant from the time she is approved for donation to the time she has recovered after nephrectomy. Approximately 1% of patients develop postoperative venous thromboembolism after donor nephrectomy and the risk of using estrogen-based oral contraceptive medications before surgery should be balanced against harms. Barrier birth control can be an appropriate option in the weeks before surgery. Women with childbearing potential should be supported by transplant programs to make a well-informed donation decision. Transplant programs should enable donation when they estimate a candidate\u2019s long-term postdonation risks are acceptable. In other words, motivated well-informed women should not be excluded from donation solely on the basis of a desire to conceive children after donation. Most women with access to recommended pregnancy care have good maternal and fetal outcomes in their postdonation pregnancies. We advocate that recommended postdonation pregnancy care be available to all women worldwide, including any treatments needed for pregnancy complications. A decision to proceed with donation in the year after delivery should carefully consider the needs of the mother and her baby. With regard to prior guidelines, the 2004 Amsterdam Forum concluded that donor nephrectomy is not detrimental to the prenatal course or outcome of future pregnancies. At the time, the participants concluded there were no data to suggest that hyperfiltration associated with the combination of unilateral nephrectomy and pregnancy leads to significant hypertension, proteinuria, change in GFR, or abnormalities of the urinary sediment. Some transplant programs have historically not disclosed any potential postdonation pregnancy risks as part of the informed consent process. However, 3 recent studies provided new information on this risk. Two retrospective cohort studies, one from the United States and the other from Norway, reported an increased risk of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia after kidney donation, based on comparisons of pregnancies before and after donation within donors (Evidence Report Table 21, SDC, http://links.lww.com/TP/B434, and Supplemental Appendix Table D18, SDC, http://links.lww.com/TP/B432). Another recent retrospective cohort study from Canada demonstrated gestational hypertension or preeclampsia was more likely to be diagnosed in kidney donors than matched nondonors with similar indicators of baseline health (11% vs 5%). The 2 groups did not differ significantly with respect to other maternal or fetal outcomes (Caesarean section, postpartum hemorrhage, preterm birth with gestation less than 37 weeks, low birth weight < 2500 g), and there were no maternal deaths, stillbirths, or neonatal deaths in either group (however, the CIs for the estimates were wide, meaning that a clinically important risk among donors was not excluded).

The quality of this evidence was graded as very low. In one study the association between donation (donors vs nondonors) and long-term mental quality of life score was not modified by age. In the other study, the cumulative incidence of recorded depression diagnoses was lower in donors compared with matched beneficiaries in the same insurance system, among both men and in women. The ERT summarized the results of several studies wherein donors with a characteristic were compared to donors without the characteristic, to see if the 2 groups differed on the chance of a poor psychosocial outcome. The quality of this evidence was graded as low to very low. These results are challenging to interpret because: many studies reported different psychosocial outcomes that were not directly comparable; the effects were not always seen across all psychosocial outcomes measured within a study; the results of characteristics associated with outcomes were inconsistent across the studies; and the likelihood a donor with the characteristic would experience the outcome was often reported in relative rather than absolute terms (see Evidence Report Tables 10, 12, 14, 15, 20, SDC, http://links.lww.com/TP/B434; Supplemental Appendix Tables D7, D9, D11, D12, D17, SDC, http://links.lww.com/TP/B432). In some studies, predonation characteristics that were associated with reduced chance of poor psychosocial outcomes (ie, with a better psychosocial prognosis) included a lack of residual ambivalence about donation (ie, no lingering hesitation or uncertainty), more education, an absence of predonation psychiatric diagnoses, an absence of feeling morally obligated to donate, more social support, lower predonation expectations of health consequences after donation, less financial burden, and the feeling of having received adequate attention from the transplant team. A systematic review of prospective studies of postdonation health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) published after completion of the ERT's systematic review for this guideline found that, among 9 studies examining risk factors for impaired HRQoL, low psychological functioning before donation was the most common predictor.", "type": "Document"}

Kidney donation has a profound and multifaceted impact on the lives of many donors and influences their identity, roles and relationships. Two recent systematic reviews summarize qualitative data about donor experiences after donation. On average, donors experienced increased self-esteem, empowerment, and community awareness, but some also described a lack of emotional support. A subsequent systematic review of 34 prospective studies of postdonation HRQoL (1990 to 2014) found that, after mild reductions early after nephrectomy, HRQoL returned to baseline or was slightly reduced by 3 to 12 months, particularly for fatigue, but was still comparable with general population norms. In general, donors demonstrate good quality of life and have low rates of donation regret. That said, living donation is not without psychosocial risk, and some donors have experienced psychosocial difficulties after donation (eg, depression, anxiety, stress, worries about health), and such problems have impacted their functioning and ability to return to work. One study was identified by the ERT that reported psychosocial outcomes in a group of donors compared with healthy nondonors, and the evidence quality was graded as very low (Evidence Report Table 8, SDC, http://links.lww.com/TP/B434; Supplemental Appendix Table D5, SDC, http://links.lww.com/TP/B432). In the reviewed multicenter study, average values of 3 HRQoL scores among donors (a median of 6 years after donation) were similar to a group of nondonors and population norms. There was also no significant difference between the 2 groups in marital status, mental health visits and psychotropic medication use. A report of 2455 living donors from 3 large US centers known as the Renal and Lung Living Donors Evaluation Study (RELIVE) cohort (93% white race, 72% biologically related to recipient) found that HRQoL scores in living donors in the decades after donation were similar or better than the US population. However, 9% of RELIVE study respondents reported one or more of the following poor psychosocial outcomes: \u201cfair\u201d or \u201cpoor\u201d overall donor experience, financial burden, regret or discomfort with decision to donate, or psychological difficulties since donation. Recipient graft failure was the only identified predictor of reporting one or more of these poor psychosocial outcomes, and was associated with 77% higher risk (OR, 1.331.772.34). Another report of 4650 privately insured living kidney donors in the United States described lower rates of depression diagnoses after donation compared with rates among age- and sex-matched beneficiaries in the same insurance system. A systematic review published in 2006 summarized 51 studies describing 5139 donors who were assessed on average 4 years after donation. Most donors who participated in follow-up reported no depression or anxiety, with questionnaire scores similar to the general population. The majority reported no change or an improved relationship with their recipient, spouse, family members and nonrecipient children. Some experienced an increase in self-esteem. A majority expressed no change in their attractiveness. Most donors (96%) did not regret their donation decision. Based on these data, we suggest that donor candidates be informed that in general, donors demonstrate good quality of life after donation. However, donor candidates should also be informed that some people experience psychosocial difficulties after donation (eg, depression, anxiety, a negative change in their relationship with the recipient, more pain than expected, a recovery time that is slower than expected, a decline in their vitality, unexpected expenses related to donation recovery, anticipated benefits that were short-lived or not met at all) or anxiety related to worries about their health (including a fear of kidney failure).", "type": "Document"}

Major costs include transportation, accommodation, child care, lost income (or vacation time), and missed time from work. In a prospective Canadian follow-up study, the mean cost associated with donation was $3268 (Canadian dollars); however for 15% of donors, costs exceeded $8000. The expenses incurred during the predonation evaluation are also described in another recent study from the United States. These findings have led to recommendations that living donor candidates receive counseling about financial costs before donation, and have fostered governmental and other programs in multiple countries to reimburse donors for their legitimate expenses and attempt to maintain financial neutrality. However, there are limitations to many current cost mitigation programs. In the United States, the National Living Donor Assistance Center (NLDAC) (via a Health Resources and Services Administration grant) offers grants to offset travel and lodging costs for living donors and an accompanying person during the evaluation, donation and follow-up, but reimbursement eligibility is means tested and is based on the incomes of both the living donor candidate and recipient; further, nondirected donors have limited access because they cannot provide recipient income information. In the United States, many states have enacted legislation to offer tax deductions or credits, or other benefits, to living organ donors. These programs vary state by state, are underused, and have not been studied with regard to impact on financial burden of donation. Several studies have considered whether kidney donation affects one\u2019s ability to obtain life, disability and health insurance. These issues are country-specific, and should be considered in donor candidate counseling and support. A 2016 convenience sample of informed consent forms for living donor and transplant candidate evaluation from 9 geographically diverse US programs identified misconceptions about defraying donation-related costs, reinforced by ambiguous language or omissions in the donor informed consent documents. Donor candidates should receive clear, accurate education on how to access available financial support as well as the limitations of available resources. In 2016, the AST launched an online financial toolkit to help donor candidates learn about the finances of being a living organ donor; this dynamic resource will be expanded and updated over time. Although developed from the perspective of US-based policies and resources, the information may be helpful to donor candidates in other countries. See chapter 18 for a discussion of policy related to financial support and removal of economic disincentives to donation.", "type": "Document"}

Candidates ultimately excluded from living donation for any reason may experience feelings of emotional distress, disappointment and guilt, frustration from inability to control one\u2019s own body and health, and in the case of planned donation to a spouse or dependent, caregiver burden or ongoing impact of the intended recipient\u2019s illness on the donor\u2019s lifestyle. The transplant program should assist excluded donor candidates who have difficulty accepting their candidacy decision in receiving needed psychosocial support or psychiatric help. In approximately 5% of living kidney donor transplants the recipient or their graft does not survive the first year. Understandably, poor recipient outcomes can be a source of stress and disappointment to the donor, and the transplant program should provide postdonation psychosocial support at such times. In some studies, but not others, poor recipient outcomes have been associated with poor psychosocial outcomes in donors. In one study, most of the adverse recipient events were beyond the first year posttransplant. Most donors will not experience poor short- or long-term medical or psychosocial outcomes after donation, but for those who do, the transplant program should participate to ensure that the donor receives psychosocial support or psychiatric help. The responsibility to ensure that donors receive psychological support when outcomes are poor is also described in a prior guideline. The Declaration of Istanbul states that all donors should be offered psychosocial services as a standard component of follow-up, and the CARI guideline recommends follow-up of the psychosocial impact of living kidney donation for every living donor during the first year after donation. Incomplete or inconsistent follow-up after the early postdonation period may lead to under-recognition of donation-related psychosocial problems in the longer-term. Models for the collection of long-term psychosocial outcomes after donation exist internationally, including the European Living Donation and Public Health (EULID) project, an 11-nation registry that uses an online tool for reporting follow-up information included psychosocial and socioeconomic outcomes. The national Swiss Living Donor Health Registry (SOL-DHR) follows donors lifelong and includes an 8-Item Short-Form (SF-8) and social-status questionnaire.", "type": "Document"}

Collectively, these reviews provide very low to high quality evidence for several outcomes, including operative time, blood loss, warm ischemia time, reoperation, length of hospital stay, and return to work. Overall, laparoscopic and open donor nephrectomies have comparable outcomes with regard to donor safety and graft function. Simple open (flank subcostal retroperitoneal) donor nephrectomy is generally performed with shorter operative times than laparoscopic nephrectomy but may incur slightly higher blood loss. Open nephrectomy is no longer considered the standard of care due to a longer incision and generally longer associated hospital stay, higher analgesia requirements, and longer convalescence period.

The distribution of 32 038 donors according to operative technique was: laparoscopic, 57.4%; hand-assisted laparoscopic, 25.3%; mini-open, 4.5%; hand-assisted retroperitoneoscopic, 3.8%; retroperitoneoscopic, 3.7%; single-port laparoscopic (ie, laparoscopic single-site surgery [LESS]), 3.8%; and robotic-assisted laparoscopic, 1.3%. Overall, conversion rate to traditional open nephrectomy was 1.1%. Intraoperative complication rate was 2.3%, most commonly bleeding (1.5%). Postoperative complications occurred in 7.3% of donors, including infectious complications in 2.6% (mainly wound infections, 1.6%) and bleeding in 1.0%. Reported mortality rate was 0.01%. Among 7 studies (2 RCTs, 2 prospective, and 3 retrospective) comparing laparoscopic (n = 1159) with retroperitoneoscopic (n = 311) techniques, there were no significant differences in rates of conversion, overall intraoperative or perioperative complications. Based on 8 studies (3 RCTs, 5 prospective) comparing mini-open (n = 322) to endoscopic (n = 288) techniques (ie, laparoperitoneoscopic, retroperitoneoscopic, with or without hand assistance), intraoperative complications were more frequently seen in endoscopic procedures (8.2% vs 3.4%; RR 1.132.455.35; P = 0.02). This difference was mostly due to intraoperative organ damage, which demonstrated a trend in favor of open procedures (0% vs 2.8%; RR 0.915.1829.35; P = 0.06). The postoperative complication rate was comparable after mini-open versus laparoscopic donor nephrectomy. Ten studies (3 RCTs, 1 prospective study, 6 retrospective series) compared single-port (n = 764) with multiport laparoscopic (n = 1214) procedures, among which pulmonary complications were more frequently reported after LESS donor nephrectomy (1.5% vs 0%; RR 1.257.5144.94; P = 0.03). The slightly higher incidence of postoperative pain after LESS compared with multiport nephrectomy was not statistically significant (2.7% vs 0.8%; RR 0.903.5614.11; P = 0.07). Limitations of this systematic review include the varying study designs, outcome definitions and ascertainment methodologies. A Cochrane review of RCTs published through January 2016 comparing LESS donor nephrectomy with laparoscopic donor nephrectomy identified 3 studies including 179 patients, and concluded that data were insufficient for drawing inferences on outcomes. At the present time, given the current limited experience and lack of robust safety and outcomes data, robotic, single-port, and natural orifice transluminal nephrectomies are not currently standard of care approaches to living donor nephrectomy and should only be performed by surgeons with adequate training and experience, and after informed consent.", "type": "Document"}

However, the choice of which kidney to procure should be made to minimize short-term and long-term complications in the donor. Thus, the presence of renal parenchymal, vascular or urological abnormalities which are not contraindications to donation may favor the use of an abnormal right kidney for donation and transplantation, for the goal of leaving the donor with the \u201cmore normal\u201d kidney and/or to minimize complications related to multiple vascular pedicles. Recent evidence supports safe laparoscopic procurement of the right kidney without increased risk of adverse outcomes compared with procurement of the left kidney, although the evidence is weak. The ERT examined one systematic review by Liu et al comparing right with left laparoscopic living donor nephrectomy, and identified very low quality evidence for similar operative times, blood loss, warm ischemia times, and length of stay at experienced centers (Evidence Report Table 5, SDC, http://links.lww.com/TP/B434; Supplemental Appendix Table C5, SDC, http://links.lww.com/TP/B432).

A study of CT scan results performed during living donor evaluation reported a prevalence of 18% to 30% for multiple renal arteries, with up to 15% bilateral involvement. Multiple renal arteries may adversely affect donor safety and recipient outcome. Multiple renal arteries may lead to intraoperative technical difficulties and complications, such as increased operative time, complicated dissection, or bleeding. Furthermore, either arterial reconstructions need to be created after procurement or multiple arterial anastomoses are needed in the recipient, both of which may be associated with complications. A small accessory artery that supplies a minor part of the upper pole (subjectively assessed using predonation CT scans) can often be safely sacrificed. However, an accessory artery that vascularizes the lower pole and the proximal ureter must be saved and reconstructed after nephrectomy. In the case of a complex venous anatomy, there is usually only one domain vein, and the remaining veins can be tied off. A systemic review by Ahmadi et al capturing reports of outcomes associated with vascular multiplicity in living donors in the past decade concluded that renal arterial multiplicity (up to 3 renal arteries) and venous anomalies should not be a contraindication to living kidney donation. Vascular anomalies require longer operative times to manage, but were not associated with significant negative impact on donor or graft outcomes with modern surgical techniques and high surgical skills. As most living donors with multiple renal arteries in the reported studies had a maximum of 3 renal arteries, conclusions cannot be drawn for donors with 4 or more arteries.

The legal framework gives legitimacy to living donation and provides some protection to the donor. All practitioners in transplant programs should be aware of relevant laws and regulations that pertain to the living donor transplant program. Ethical tenets and specific transplant program processes are applied to minimize donor risk. See chapter 1 for discussion of the conceptual framework for decision-making related to donor acceptance, and roles and responsibilities in donation-related care, and chapter 2 for details on the processes and content of informed consent. When there is opportunity to identify needs for policy and legal changes to improve the practice of living donation, transplant programs should actively participate in the review and process to update or change laws, regulations and policies as needed. Laws to regulate donation include, but are not limited to, those that: a) protect the vulnerable (eg, the cognitively impaired, young people, dependent persons); b) respect autonomy (eg, require informed consent); c) prohibit incentives to donate that may create undue influence (eg, payment for organs in money or in kind). Other relevant laws and policies related to donor protections include insurability criteria related to donation status, state tax credits for donation-related expenses, and access to medical leave after donation. Transplant professionals have an ethical duty to act in the best interests of donor candidates and donors. Self-determination related to the donation decision reflects a view of people as autonomous agents. Donor autonomy in the willingness to be considered as a donor candidate or to withdraw should be respected during all phases of the evaluation and donation process. Programs should support autonomy through a fully informed consent process (chapter 2). Balancing risks and benefits to the donor as well as respecting the donor\u2019s wishes for donation addresses the principle of beneficence. In the United States, concern that kidney paired donation could be construed as violating the prohibition of NOTA to transfers of organs for valuable consideration was addressed with a specific amendment (\u201cNorwood Act\u201d of 2007) that explicitly defined paired donation as exempt from NOTA violation. Although nonsimultaneous chains initiated by nondirected donors do not technically fall within the exemption for kidney paired donation, there is arguably no need for an exemption with respect to chains initiated by nondirected donors because they are designed as a series of gifts, rather than as an exchange of valuable consideration. See chapter 3 for discussion of clinical and educational issues related to paired donation.", "type": "Document"}

Recipient candidates may not feel comfortable sharing their need for an organ donor with their social network for reasons including not knowing how to ask, misunderstanding of risks, and fear for harm to the donor candidate. A 2015 AST Live Donor Community of Practice consensus statement on \u201cBest Practices in Live Kidney Donation\u201d deemed implementation of approaches to empower transplant candidates and their loved one in their search for a living donor to be a high priority. Developing effective methods to address the growing organ shortage, including through living donor transplantation, is the highest stated priority in the 2015 US OPTN Strategic Plan and was endorsed in a June 2016 White House Summit on Organ Donation. Appropriate strategies for promoting living donation might include education (public, clinic-based, home-based), use of advocated (eg, \u201clive donor champions\u201d), efficiencies in the evaluation of donor candidates (eg, use of new information technology) and the removal of disincentives. Effective interventions may include participation of family and friends of the transplant candidate to increase knowledge and awareness of living donation within the patient's social network. The evidence supporting use of social media tools to enable transplant candidates to share their need for a living donor with their social network is at an early stage, but given the growing use of the internet and devices such as smartphones globally, application of technology to donor identification is anticipated to grow and was referenced by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. The ethical appropriateness of strategies for promoting living donation may vary with the entity employing the strategy. For example, direct promotion of donation by transplant programs may raise ethical concerns for conflict of interest and risk eroding public trust and the quality of donor decision-making, but training and support of advocated (eg, \u201clive donor champions\u201d) can be an appropriate alternative if employed conscientiously, including the careful use of anticoercion training. Nonprofit groups separate from transplant programs may have more freedom in promoting donation without challenging ethical norms underlying the physician-patient relationship, but still bear ethical responsibilities to present evidence-based information and maintain public trust. Development of \u201cbest practices\u201d related to use of well-designed, evidence-based approaches including technology to efficiently and ethically expand opportunities for willing, well-informed patients and potential donors to pursue living donor transplantation and living donation is an important priority. All strategies for living donor identification must respect donor autonomy and cannot exert undue pressure to donate. Critically, a wish not to donate must always be respected. Some people respond to public solicitations by offering to be a kidney donor. By evaluating these donor candidates, transplant programs are enabling donation. In this setting, the standard evaluation needs to address additional issues related to the parties\u2019 limited knowledge of each other, and the potential for exploitation. Recently, the Canadian Society of Transplantation issued a position paper that addressed issues such as privacy, informed consent, and donor follow-up associated with public donor solicitation.", "type": "Document"}

Living donor candidates have the right to be informed of available legitimate cost-replacements programs for evaluation and donation-related expenses. Initiatives to remove financial disincentives to kidney donation (ie, replacement of costs incurred during the evaluation and donation such as lost income, travel costs, accommodation costs; avoidance of insurance discrimination) are acceptable as an issue of justice. Multiple prior living donation guidelines and viewpoints endorse reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses incurred during the evaluation and donation processes, independent of the final decision to proceed with donation. In the United States, the prohibition of organ exchange for \u201cvaluable consideration\u201d in NOTA has been clarified as not prohibiting \u201creasonable payments associated with\u2026 the expenses of travel, housing, and lost wages incurred by the donor of a human organ in connection with the donation of the organ.\u201d To date, developing programs for wage reimbursement has posed the most challenges internationally, including the need for accepted definition of lost wages and the potentially large cost of reimbursing very high-income donors. In December 2016, New Zealand passed legislation to provide 100% of a donor's earnings for up to 12 weeks after donation plus childcare assistance for donors who need it while they recover. Also in December 2016, the US NLDAC, which to date has provided funds to reimburse donation-related travel and lodging costs, announced that it will conduct an RCT to assess the impact of interventions intended to remove financial barriers to living organ donation through wage reimbursement. Recommendations to offer life and disability and/or health insurance for living donors, or to pass legislation to offer tax credits and ensure employment and insurability protections to donors, have also been advanced. In 2016, the AST launched an online financial toolkit to help donor candidates learn about the finances of being a living organ donor; this dynamic resource will be expanded and updated over time.

These are living donors who offer a kidney to a transplant center to allocate, as they do not have an identified recipient. Nondirected donors may also donate by participating in a KPD program or as part of a series of matched donor and recipient pairs allowing for a chain of multiple transplants. Some nondirected living donors and their recipients may request contact with each other postdonation. Clarification before donation of the center\u2019s policy on such contacts enables participants to adjust their expectations after donation. The extent of the physician-patient relationship after donation should be communicated before donation, including whether the donor can seek medical care at the transplant center after the donation. See chapter 19 for discussion of postdonation follow-up recommendations. Kidney failure is a rare event after living kidney donation, but fatal in the absence of kidney replacement therapy. Federally funded programs to assure access to dialysis and transplantation can be promoted as a strategy to protect the safety of living donors if the remaining kidney fails after donation. Payment for dialysis services, payment for living or deceased donor transplantation, and allocation priority for deceased donor kidney transplantation are examples of such programs. Many countries provide substantial assistance for dialysis and transplantation as part of public health services. For example in the United States, prior living donors receive additional priority points for deceased donor kidney transplants, which has been associated with higher transplant rates, shorter time to transplant, and receipt of higher quality allografts compared to candidates with otherwise similar clinical profiles. However, the transplant center must report prior donor status for the patient to receive priority. Priority for prior living donors can also be incorporated in KPD matching algorithms. In Israel, when a living donor develops ESKD subsequent to the donation, the living donor can designate a family member to receive priority on the deceased donor transplant waitlist. The purpose is to reduce the disincentive to current donation based on concern that a family member may need a kidney transplant in the future.

The donor enters the relationship with an interest in offering an altruistic and life-extending gift of an organ for transplantation if he or she is healthy enough to donate and meets the transplant center\u2019s acceptance criteria. Grounded in primary concern for the well-being of the donor, the transplant center should promote the donor\u2019s autonomy, safety and long-term health throughout all phases of care including evaluation, donation surgery, long-term follow-up and donation-related care. Early postdonation follow-up care is routinely practiced as part of postoperative care. In contrast, responsibility for the coordination and performance of long-term donor follow-up has raised controversies regarding financial and time burden on both transplant centers and donors, especially in countries without universal health insurance. Monitoring incurs costs and may provide only limited information for the majority of donors who may demonstrate stable clinical status and well-being. However, as articulated in a 2011 consensus conference report, these concerns are outweighed by fundamental ethical principles and clinical needs to support the practice of living donation, including: The need to provide accurate outcomes information to donor candidates and their recipients as a basis for informed consent, especially regarding trends in outcomes and incremental hazards that may be associated with race/ethnicity, baseline comorbidity, changes in surgical approaches and management strategies.The need to acquire more robust outcomes data to improve the evaluation process and to provide reliable counseling for donor candidates tailored for demographic and health profile.The possibility of identification of individual donor clinical problems through surveillance at a time when intervention is possible.Provision of program-specific feedback to guide quality assurance and performance improvement.Recognition of the professional obligation of the transplant community to continue to collect and monitor information on living donor outcomes.

As discussed in chapter 10, hypertension is diagnosed more commonly in kidney donors than in persons with comparable baseline health, although this may in part reflect greater monitoring and earlier recognition. Early detection and treatment of medical conditions that may subsequently affect GFR may protect the donor from further loss of GFR or other deterioration in health. Such conditions should be managed according to clinical practice guidelines either by the donor\u2019s primary care provider, or at the transplant center if appropriate care is available. Because many donors develop low GFR that meets criteria for diagnosis of CKD and the risk of someday developing kidney failure needing treatment with dialysis or transplantation is slightly higher as a result of donation (see chapter 5), postdonation monitoring for kidney disease and CKD risk factors is warranted. Living kidney donors should be monitored for CKD and managed according to the 2012 KDIGO CKD Guideline. Donors should also receive age-appropriate healthcare maintenance, and management of clinical conditions and health risk factors according to clinical practice guidelines for the local or regional population. Assessment of psychosocial metrics such as HRQoL have been recommended as part of postdonation follow-up to monitor general well-being, and to help transplant centers identify donors at risk for poor psychosocial outcomes. Quality of life measures are collected as part of standard postdonation follow-up in some donor registries. Guidelines for metric thresholds indicating presence of an impairment that would prompt more attention by the clinician are not specifically defined in donors, but could be based on existing test standards (eg, scores below 0.50 standard deviation of the normative mean on the \u201cShort Form\u201d (SF) class of measure, SF-36, 12, or 8).", "type": "Document"}

Because donors in many countries report regular follow-up with a primary provider, donor follow-up and care may be appropriately performed by a primary care provider to preserve convenience for the donor. However, communication of follow-up information back to the transplant center is necessary for centers to be aware of the health status of their donors, to comply with reporting mandates (when applicable), and to direct additional care if needed. The role of a primary care provider in a donor\u2019s follow-up plan should be established before donation. The transplant center should always be available as a resource for the donor\u2019s primary care provider. Documentation of a donor\u2019s acknowledgement of their responsibility to participate in follow-up through a signed care plan has been proposed as part of education, although efficacy in achieving follow-up participation has not been formally evaluated. Particular attention should be given to donors with risk factors for follow-up deficiencies and to those with baseline factors associated with increased risk of CKD over time. Donor education before and at the time of donation is critical to support an informed donation decision, but there is a need to continue education on health promoting practices as the donor recovers and ages. A donor in the midst of making a decision to donate or dealing with the early outcomes of donation such as postoperative pain and financial pressures may not absorb all the information on long-term issues. The establishment of standardized follow-up at serial time points provides a pattern for follow-up care that the donor may be more likely to continue on regular, yearly preventive healthcare visits. Regular contact between the transplant center and the donor and/or the donor\u2019s primary care physician also increases familiarity of staff with issues that develop after donation, providing an opportunity to modify education materials or processes to better manage these situations for future donors. While regular healthcare maintenance is important over the lifetime after donation, data collection at regular time points by transplant centers should be pertinent to donation, attainable, and not overly burdensome on the donor or the transplant center. Early follow-up of donors by transplant centers is mandated in some countries including the United States, Canada and Australia. In the United States, the country that performs the largest volume of living donor kidney transplants per year, follow-up reporting by centers to the national transplant registry is limited to 2 years postdonation, and has historically suffered from missing data and frequent loss-to-follow-up. Follow-up deficiencies have correlated with patient factors including younger donor age, black race, lack of insurance, lower educational attainment, and greater distance to the transplant center. Lack of health insurance had been more common among living kidney donors in the United States than in the general US population, although that disparity has not been present in recent years, perhaps due to changes in the economy and policy changes including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA). Lack of insurance and lower educational attainment may pose lesser obstacles to follow-up in other countries where national healthcare is available. Among US centers in 2008 to 2012, large annual living donation volumes were also associated with increased rates of follow-up deficiencies. However, implementation of mandatory thresholds for collection of postdonation clinical and laboratory data in the United States in 2013 with regulatory implications has led to improved rates of early follow-up data collection, and high levels of follow-up have been achieved by programs across the volume spectrum. There is a real need for comprehensive, long-term (lifetime) follow-up of living donors. Short-term follow-up may detect severe adverse outcomes early after donation but cannot detect gradual, progressive complications that occur late after donation. Clinically important events that may develop in the intermediate to long-term after donation include hypertension, CKD, metabolic conditions (eg, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia) and CVD, which in turn may increase the risk of kidney failure and mortality. Transplant programs achieve high rates of postdonation follow-up have practices that appear to be grounded in: 1) program conviction that follow-up is essential for donor safety and well-being; 2) emphasis on building and maintaining a relationship with each donor; 3) use of a systematic approach to follow-up; and 4) efforts to minimize the burden on donors. Open-ended, qualitative interviews of US programs found that programs with high rates of successful follow-up endorsed all 4 of these concepts. Recent single-center experience supports that institution of follow-up performance improvement initiatives with dedicated program resources is financially feasible and can result in more accurate and complete follow-up after donation.", "type": "Document"}

Informed consent for collection of follow-up information for registry reporting should be requested during the consent for donor evaluation. In countries where registries do not exist, efforts should be made to establish and maintain a donor registry to support ongoing monitoring of postdonation outcomes, as the characteristics of accepted donors and care practices may evolve over time. Some countries have instituted systematic approaches to longer-term living donor follow-up and registry reporting. The EULID project began with an 11-nation assessment of living donation practices in Europe that recommended mandatory living donor registration and follow-up data collections through a centralized donor database system, and mandatory regulatory audits at the national and center level. An online registry is used for reporting of information on donor health status, quality of informed consent, and psychosocial and socioeconomic outcomes. The European Living Donor Psychosocial Follow-Up (ELIPSY), a study conducted in 6 centers of different European countries (Spain, Germany, France, Portugal, Sweden and Turkey) in 2009 to 2012, focused on monitoring donor psychosocial well-being and quality of life. The SOL-DHR provides a model for involvement of primary care physicians to achieve short- and long-term follow-up of donor health and well-being. In 1993, a national protocol was initiated for all Swiss transplant centers to organize lifelong follow-up after donation at 1, 3, 5, 7, 10 years, and biennially thereafter, by sending a package to the donor asking the donor to make an appointment with the family physician of their choice. The package contains brief information for the donor and the family physician, a health questionnaire, tubes for blood and urine samples, and a prepaid envelope for sending the samples at room temperature to the central laboratory. The basic biennial follow-up questionnaire is completed by the family physician. In 2002, requests were added for completion an additional 8-Item Short-Form (SF-8) and social-status questionnaire by the donor. Nonresponses are followed by contacting the recipient, the donor\u2019s health insurance and public registries to identify whether the donor has died and, if so, the cause of death. Lifelong follow-up of the living donor\u2019s health status by centers is required by the Swiss Transplant Law. Although donors may choose to stop participating, compliance is promoted by informing donors about the aims of the protocol and the registry before their donation. Similarly, in Norway, donor follow-up includes initial contacts at weeks 3 to 4, month 3, then yearly monitoring for 5 years, and then lifelong contacts every fifth year thereafter. Clinical assessment of donors including BP, blood tests and urinalysis examinations is performed by local county hospitals. Durability of follow-up has been demonstrated as 99, 95, 84, and 77% of donors are still seen by local nephrologists at 1, 5, 10, and 15 years follow-up, respectively (Dr. Hallvard Holdaas, personal communication). In 2017, the US Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients began planning and transplant program enrollment for a Health Services Research Administration \u201cLiving Donor Collective\u201d pilot project that seeks to achieve life-long living donor follow-up through direct contacts by staff and novel data linkages. A notable feature of the Collective is a plan to collect long-term outcomes data on all persons who present for donor candidate evaluation to provide information on donor exclusion practices and identify a set of healthy controls (eg, approved donors who do not donate due to recipient exclusions.) If successful, the goal is to expand to national participation. Given the current limited scope and duration of donor registries in many countries, and the possibility that some donors as independent decision makers may choose not to stay in contact with their transplant center, collection of outcome data in dedicated, funded research studies, and integration of donor registry data with other information sources such as health administrative data, ESKD and mortality registries are also important additional priorities for advancing understanding of long-term health outcomes after donation.", "type": "Document"}

Although it was not a specific guideline recommendation and no evidence was cited, the Amsterdam Forum suggested that \u201cAs in the general population, based on age and other medical risk factors (eg, hypertension, proteinuria, hyperlipidemia, impaired glucose tolerance test), kidney donors should undergo regular long-term follow-up of body weight, BP, blood glucose, serum creatinine, and urinalysis.\u201d In the United States, OPTN policy enacted in 2013 requires transplant centers to collect and report the following information on their donors to the national registry at 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years postdonation: serum creatinine, urine protein and a set of clinical outcomes (eg, kidney complications, need for maintenance dialysis, development of hypertension or diabetes, loss of insurance due to donation). Other guidelines also suggest postdonation follow-up for at least 1 year or lifelong and provision of donation-related psychosocial services as needed during follow-up have also been proposed.

Recommendation 2: Further clinical trials of neoadjuvant radiotherapy in combination with immunotherapy or targeted therapy are recommended (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). Evidence summary: Two prospective randomized controlled trials (RCTs) failed to demonstrate significant survival benefits from neoadjuvant CCRT. Several phase I/II studies showed that neoadjuvant immunotherapy plus radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy led to major pathologic response (MPR) in 74.1\u201380% of locally advanced NSCLC, with manageable safety profiles. These findings suggest that preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy combined with radiotherapy and immunotherapy is safe and feasible; however, the efficacy of this combination regimen warrants further validation through large RCTs and long-term follow-up.[ Rationale for recommendation: (1) For patients with potentially resectable stage III NSCLC, both prospective RCTs failed to demonstrate significant survival benefits from neoadjuvant CCRT. Hence, it is not recommended as a routine treatment outside of clinical trial settings. (2) Several phase I/II studies have shown that neoadjuvant immunotherapy combined with radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy resulted in high MPR rates and favorable safety profiles in locally advanced NSCLC.

Recommendation 2: For patients who are ineligible for surgical resection or unable to tolerate surgery, radical CCRT is recommended (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). Evidence summary: Multiple phase II clinical trials and one meta-analysis indicated that neoadjuvant CCRT followed by surgery was superior to radiotherapy alone or to radiotherapy plus surgery in terms of R0 resection rates, pathologic complete response (pCR) rates, and median survival in patients with T3\u20134 and N0\u20131 NSCLC of the superior pulmonary sulcus. Therefore, multimodality treatment with neoadjuvant CCRT followed by surgery is recommended for patients with T3\u20134 and N0\u20131 tumors, and radical CCRT is recommended for those ineligible for surgical resection or unable to tolerate surgery.[ Rationale for recommendation: (1) Pancoast tumors are a unique subtype of NSCLC. The resection margins are significantly correlated with survival. Patients who undergo R0 resection have a significantly longer survival time compared to those with R1 or R2 resection. (2) These tumors are relatively sensitive to chemoradiotherapy, with pCR rates of 20\u201330%. (3) Current evidence primarily originates from phase II clinical studies on T3\u20134 and N0\u20131 Pancoast tumors, with a lack of large RCTs.

Patients without contraindications for ICIs are recommended to receive 3\u20134 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus immunotherapy, with follow-up examinations and evaluations performed preoperatively, and to undergo surgery 4\u20136 weeks after the last treatment cycle (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). Evidence summary: Six RCTs provided direct evidence for the indications and regimens for neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus immunotherapy in patients with resectable stage IB\u2013IIIA (based on TNM classification in the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) 7th edition; and for IASLC 8th edition, it is stage IIA-IIIA) NSCLC.[ The phase III RCT CheckMate 816[ showed that patients with stage IB\u2013IIIA NSCLC receiving chemotherapy plus nivolumab followed by surgery achieved significantly longer progression-free survival (PFS) compared with those receiving chemotherapy alone plus surgery (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.63, 97.38% confidence interval [CI], 0.43\u20130.91; P = 0.005).

In particular, neoadjuvant immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy resulted in significantly higher MPR rates, pCR rates, and EFS compared with traditional neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Therefore, neoadjuvant immunotherapy is recommended for patients with resectable stage II\u2013IIIA NSCLC. While immunotherapy is associated with several side effects, its overall safety is still manageable (strong recommendation, high-quality evidence). For patients who are unable to tolerate chemotherapy, single-agent immunotherapy or immunotherapy combined with small molecule antiangiogenic targeted therapy may also be suggested as alternative neoadjuvant immunotherapy options (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). Evidence summary: Six prospective multicenter RCTs showed that compared with traditional preoperative chemotherapy, preoperative immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy significantly increased EFS, pCR rates, and MPR rates without increasing the incidences of adverse events. Another prospective phase I/II clinical trials demonstrated that neoadjuvant single-agent immunotherapy and neoadjuvant immunotherapy combined with small molecule targeted drugs were safe and effective for the treatment of NSCLC.[ Rationale for recommendation: (1) The perioperative and short-term efficacy of neoadjuvant immunotherapy is well-established in patients with resectable stage II\u2013III NSCLC.

However, the optimal treatment duration is currently unclear. Based on existing evidence, 6\u20139 weeks of targeted therapy are suggested before surgery (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). Evidence summary: In a multicenter, open-label, phase II RCT (CTONG 1103),[ patients with EGFR mutation-positive stage IIIA\u2013N2 NSCLC receiving neoadjuvant erlotinib treatment had significantly prolonged PFS compared with patients receiving chemotherapy (HR = 0.39, 95% CI: 0.23\u20130.67; P <0.001). In a single-arm, open-label phase II clinical trial (NEOS)[ in patients with EGFR sensitizing mutation-positive stage IIA\u2013IIIB lung adenocarcinoma, MPR and pCR were achieved in 10.7% and 3.6% of the 28 pathologically evaluable patients who received neoadjuvant osimertinib treatment, respectively. In addition, nearly half (13/28) of the patients had a pathologic response exceeding 50%. Furthermore, some case reports and small-cohort retrospective studies supported the use of neoadjuvant anaplastic lymphoma kinase-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (ALK-TKI) therapy in ALK fusion-positive cancer. In a small-cohort study of crizotinib in 11 patients with ALK-positive NSCLC, 10 patients achieved partial response (PR), 1 had stable disease (SD), 10 underwent R0 resection, and 2 achieved pCR.[ Rationale for recommendation: Patients with EGFR mutation- or ALK fusion-positive NSCLC respond poorly to immunotherapy. Neoadjuvant targeted therapy may be an effective option for this subset of patients with resectable NSCLC. Preliminary data indicated that neoadjuvant targeted therapy results in lower MPR or pCR rate but comparable R0 resection rate, downstaging, EFS, disease-free survival (DFS), and PFS compared to chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy. Although the optimal duration of neoadjuvant targeted therapy has yet to be determined, 6\u20139 weeks of neoadjuvant targeted therapy are recommended prior to surgery until more definitive evidence becomes available.", "type": "Document"}

Evidence summary: Five prospective studies[ showed that perioperative lung and breathing exercises improved postoperative lung function, significantly increased respiratory muscle endurance, reduced postoperative pulmonary complications, shortened the duration of chest tube drainage and hospital stay, alleviated postoperative anxiety, promoted rapid recovery, and enhanced the quality of life of patients. Comprehensive pulmonary rehabilitation, including aerobic, resistance, and breathing exercises, significantly improved patients\u2019 exercise capacity at six months after pneumonectomy and prevented the decline in exercise tolerance at one month after surgery. Four retrospective analyses supported the implementation of perioperative lung and breathing exercises in patients with NSCLC and suggested using the diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) as a marker for quantitative assessment.[ Rationale for recommendation: Perioperative lung and breathing exercises are useful for reducing perioperative complications, improving postoperative lung re-expansion, and promoting rapid recovery in patients with NSCLC. The postoperative rehabilitation plan should integrate breathing exercises with comprehensive rehabilitation exercises to enhance exercise capacity, improve quality of life, and reduce postoperative anxiety. Patients can engage in breathing exercises in various ways that they find acceptable. DLCO can be used as a marker for quantitative assessment.", "type": "Document"}

Evidence summary: Three prospective RCTs showed that compared to the placebo, wound care with analgesics resulted in significantly decreased levels of systemic inflammatory markers (interleukin [IL]-6, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-\u03b1]), lower pain scores at rest and after coughing, reduced intake of additional morphine and ketorolac, and a better forced expiratory volume in one second/forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) ratio.[ Preemptive epidural anesthesia combined with lidocaine ointment has been shown to substantially reduce pain associated with chest tube removal. In addition, preemptive flurbiprofen axetil administration before surgery led to significant postoperative pain relief, reduced inflammatory and stress responses, and enhanced immune responses in patients undergoing video-assisted thoracoscopic lobectomy. Seven retrospective studies showed that different perioperative analgesic regimens and dosages exhibited generally high but varying efficacy and safety in patients with NSCLC, necessitating high-quality evidence to support clinical decision-making.[ Rationale for recommendation: Postoperative pain restricts patients\u2019 postural changes, hinders effective coughing and expectoration, and impedes the clearance of airway secretions, thereby increasing the risks of atelectasis and pulmonary infections. Studies have shown that perioperative analgesia management reduced pain scores, improved postoperative pain perception, decreased stress response, and accelerated the recovery of respiratory function. Moreover, preemptive and multimodal analgesia is demonstrably effective in providing pain relief.", "type": "Document"}

Prophylaxis should be initiated before surgery and continued for 7\u201310 days (or 4 weeks for some high-risk patients) after surgery (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). Oral anticoagulants such as rivaroxaban are only suggested for use in clinical trial settings (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). Evidence summary: Two meta-analyses and three prospective studies indicated that heparin or LMWH significantly reduced perioperative VTE in patients with NSCLC. One prospective study reported that patients taking heparin for 24 weeks had reduced VTE. One single-center RCT demonstrated that rivaroxaban was not inferior to LMWH in preventing VTE. Two prospective studies and one retrospective study found that mechanical prophylaxis with or without heparin was superior to either heparin alone or no pharmacological prophylaxis.[ Rationale for recommendation: (1) Unfractionated heparin or LMWH is effective in preventing perioperative VTE in patients with NSCLC, with low cost and manageable side effects. (2) Mechanical prophylaxis synergistically prevents perioperative VTE in patients with NSCLC.

If severe malnutrition is identified before surgery, nutritional support therapy should be initiated 7\u201314 days in advance. The preferred approach is nutritional education combined with oral nutritional supplementation (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). Evidence summary: One systematic review indicated that multimodal prehabilitation improved patients\u2019 mobility and lung function, and preoperative nutritional intervention reduced the incidence of postoperative complications. In addition, both the 2021 ESPEN Guideline on Nutrition in Cancer Patients and Practical Guideline: Clinical Nutrition in Surgery recommended nutritional risk screening for perioperative patients and nutritional therapy for those at risk of malnutrition. The 2021 Clinical Practice Guidelines for Enhanced Recovery after Surgery in China by the Branch of Surgery and Branch of Anesthesiology, Chinese Medical Association recommended preoperative nutritional risk screening and the development of nutrition care plans for patients at nutritional risk.[ Rationale for recommendation: Nutritional status is an independent prognostic factor affecting clinical outcomes. Nutritional risk screening and nutritional assessment are pivotal for formulating nutritional intervention strategies.[ Perioperative nutritional risk screening helps identify patients at nutritional risk, enabling them to benefit from preoperative nutritional intervention.[ For patients with severe malnutrition, 7\u201314 days of preoperative nutritional treatment have been shown to reduce surgical risks and postoperative complications.[", "type": "Document"}

The recommended target protein intake is 1.5 g\u00b7kg\u20131\u00b7d\u20131 (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). Evidence summary: One RCT in 73 perioperative patients with NSCLC showed that multimodal prehabilitation with a recommended protein intake of 1.5 g\u00b7kg\u20131\u00b7d\u20131 significantly improved patients\u2019 lung function and exercise capacity, as evidenced by increased 6-minute walk distance and forced vital capacity, compared with the standard care group. The Chinese Expert Consensus on Perioperative Nutritional Support in Enhanced Recovery after Surgery (2019 edition), released by the Branch of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition of the Chinese Medical Association, and Enhanced Recovery after Surgery (ERAS) Committee of the Chinese Medicine Education Association, recommends a target protein intake of 1.5 g\u00b7kg\u20131\u00b7d\u20131. The 2021 ESPEN Guideline on Nutrition in Cancer Patients recommends a daily protein intake of above 1 g/kg and up to 1.5 g/kg if possible. Rationale for recommendation: Stress, trauma, and infection can cause an increase in protein breakdown, resulting in significantly higher protein requirements. Adequate protein intake stimulates the synthesis of muscle proteins, acute phase proteins, and immune-associated proteins, thereby promoting wound healing.[ In addition, patients with cancer require adequate protein consumption to maintain basic anabolism.[ Adequate protein intake helps to preserve lean soft tissues, reduce the incidence of postoperative complications, and promote functional recovery.[", "type": "Document"}

For patients who underwent level 4 surgical procedures or are at risk of severe malnutrition, longer-term oral nutritional supplementation is recommended (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence). Evidence summary: The 2021 ESPEN Guideline on Nutrition in Cancer Patients recommends providing appropriate nutritional support for surgical cancer patients who are at risk of malnutrition or are already malnourished, both during their hospital stay and after discharge. In line with this, the 2021 ESPEN Practical Guideline: Clinical Nutrition in Surgery recommends regular reassessment of nutritional status during the stay in hospital and, if necessary, a continuation of nutritional support therapy including qualified dietary counseling after discharge, for patients who have received nutritional support therapy perioperatively and still do not cover appropriately their energy requirements via the oral route. Rationale for recommendation: Inadequate oral energy intake is often observed after surgery and becomes more pronounced after discharge. Therefore, ensuring sufficient energy intake is vital for supporting patients\u2019 postoperative recovery.[ For patients who are malnourished or are at high nutritional risk during postoperative recovery, effective nutritional support should continue at home after discharge.

(2) The chest tube is suggested to be removed as soon as possible once the criteria for removal are met: Lung re-expansion confirmed on chest X-ray, fluid sealing without air leak upon coughing, no chylous or purulent drainage fluid, and drainage volume <300 mL in 24 h (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). Evidence summary: Very few studies examined the effect of early water and food intake after surgery. Two prospective cohort studies[ and four retrospective studies[ on early postoperative ambulation were retrieved. Ding et al[ analyzed the early ambulatory activities and postoperative complications of 226 patients with LC who underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. Patients who initiated ambulation within 24 h after surgery experienced a significant reduction in the time to first postoperative defecation, the duration until chest tube removal, and the length of stay, along with reduced pain scores on day 3 and a decreased incidence of postoperative complications. A total of seven retrospective studies that reported the criteria for drainage tube removal were retrieved.[ It was found that the daily volume of pleural effusion affected the timing of chest tube removal. Most surgeons consider that the removal of a chest tube is considered safe when the drainage volume is less than 200 mL in 24 h. The safety of this criterion was also confirmed by Younes et al[ and Hessami et al[. The safety of higher volume thresholds for chest tube removal has also been clinically explored. Several studies have shown that a drainage volume of less than 300 mL/d was safe for tube chest removal. In addition, the safety of using 300 mL/d as a criterion for chest tube removal has been supported to some extent by studies that used a threshold of 400 mL/d. However, the conclusions on the safety of chest tube removal at a drainage volume of 400 mL/d or 450 mL/d have been inconsistent across studies.[ In addition, Yun et al[ proposed a modified chest tube placement strategy that was safe and had better clinical efficacy than the routine type. Based on the results reported in the above literature, a drainage volume of less than 300 mL/d is recommended as a safe criterion for chest tube removal. Rationale for recommendation: Early water and food intake, along with ambulation, are key components of ERAS. This approach aims to promote early gastrointestinal function, mitigate complications associated with immobilization, and reduce the length of hospital stay. In contrast, bed rest is associated with several deleterious consequences, including physical deconditioning, decreased muscle mass, increased pulmonary complications (atelectasis and pneumonia), and increased risk of VTE. The chest drainage tube should be removed after surgery once the removal criteria are met, as this helps alleviate pain, encourages ambulation, and accelerates patient recovery.", "type": "Document"}

Recommendation 2: PORT is not routinely recommended for patients with stage III-N2 NSCLC after standard radical surgery for LC (strong recommendation, high-quality evidence). Recommendation 3: PORT is recommended for high-risk NSCLC individuals (strong recommendation, high-quality evidence). High-risk NSCLC individuals refer to postoperative NSCLC patients who have high-risk factors. Common high-risk factors include pathologically positive mediastinal lymph nodes dissected from the highest station, extracapsular lymph node invasion, positive multistation mediastinal lymph nodes, insufficient lymph node dissection, high lymph node metastasis rate, and refusal or inability to tolerate systemic therapy. Other risk factors include \u22654 positive mediastinal lymph nodes, stage N2, stage T3\u20134, proximal bronchial margins, and pathological N2 (pN2) status after neoadjuvant drug therapy and surgery for stage N2 disease. Recommended PORT regimen: The target area for PORT should include the stump (in the presence of high-risk factors) and the high-risk lymph node drainage area, with a total dose of 50\u201354 Gy (or an increased local dose of 60 Gy for positive margin or extracapsular lymph node invasion). The protection of normal organs, such as the lungs and heart, should be prioritized, and advanced techniques such as intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) are recommended. Evidence summary: (1) Two retrospective studies involving patients with stage III-pN2 NSCLC who underwent R1/R2 resection without systematic mediastinal lymph node dissection showed that PORT after incomplete resection significantly improved overall survival (OS).[ (2) We identified ten studies involving patients with stage III-N2 NSCLC who underwent standard radical surgery for LC. Two prospective multicenter RCTs did not support the use of conventional PORT in patients with stage III-pN2 NSCLC, demonstrating that PORT prolonged local relapse-free survival (LRFS) but failed to improve OS in some patients. In contrast, four retrospective studies supported the use of PORT in patients with stage III-N2 NSCLC, indicating that PORT prolonged DFS, reduced local recurrence rate, and improved OS. In addition, patients with high-risk factors may benefit more from PORT.[ (3) We identified eleven eligible studies involving patients with stage III-N2 NSCLC at high risk of local recurrence. Retrospective analyses of patients who received PORT and those who did not revealed that outcomes were influenced by multiple factors, with PORT offering a survival benefit in the postoperative stage N2 subgroup.[ Rationale for recommendation: (1) Patients with stage pN2 NSCLC are a very heterogeneous population with varying clinicopathological features, therapeutic strategies, and outcomes. (2) The inclusion criteria for the RCTs of PORT involved patients with stage N2 NSCLC who underwent standard radical surgery for LC and achieved R0 resection without neoadjuvant therapy. These criteria are not applicable to patients with stage N2 disease following neoadjuvant therapy, those who did not undergo standard radical surgery for LC, and those who did not achieve R0 resection. (3) Two RCTs demonstrated that PORT reduced mediastinal lymph node recurrence but had no significant survival benefits. Furthermore, the studies did not support the use of conventional PORT in patients with stage III-pN2 disease. In contrast, several retrospective analyses suggested a survival benefit from PORT. (4) With advances in radiotherapy techniques and equipment and a reduction in associated toxicities, PORT may provide survival benefits for patients with postoperative stage N2 disease who are eligible for the studies or who have high-risk factors.", "type": "Document"}

Cardiopulmonary toxicity is a common side effect of adjuvant radiotherapy; thus, the radiation dose to the lungs and heart should be strictly controlled. Advanced techniques including IMRT are recommended. Medications and other treatments may be administered as needed based on the type and severity of the toxicity (strong recommendation, high-quality evidence). Evidence summary: Three studies demonstrated that PORT resulted in a high incidence of cardiopulmonary and other toxicities, as well as non-cancer deaths, which were associated with 2D radiation techniques, large irradiation fields, and the radiation dose and fractions.[ Studies on modern radiotherapy techniques have shown that a decreased irradiation volume, a single dose of \u22642 Gy, and a total dose of \u226454 Gy could reduce the incidence of cardiopulmonary toxicity. Rationale for recommendation: (1) Early side effects of PORT include radiation pneumonitis, radiation esophagitis, radiation pericarditis, fatigue, nausea, and hematotoxicity, whereas late side effects include pulmonary fibrosis and cardiac damage. (2) The cardiac radiation dose is significantly associated with cardiac events, especially for conventional radiotherapy. Cardiac-specific mortality caused by modern radiotherapy techniques has been decreasing annually, suggesting the effectiveness of cardiotoxicity management. (3) Symptomatic treatment, and drug intervention treatment if necessary (such as glucocorticoids, antibiotics, bronchodilators, thymosin \u03b11 [T\u03b11], etc.). Large-scale randomized controlled clinical trials are encouraged. (4) Regular follow-up is necessary for monitoring recurrence and side effects.", "type": "Document"}

The specific procedures should be tailored to the patients\u2019 tumor type and stage. The postoperative follow-up of central LC should include fiberoptic bronchoscopy (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). (2) The frequency of postoperative follow-up for patients with NSCLC is recommended to be determined based on the stage of the disease. Chest X-rays, hematology tests, and liver and kidney function assessments should be conducted one month post-surgery. Patients with stage I NSCLC should be followed up once every six months in the first three years after radical surgery, and annually thereafter. Patients with stage II or higher NSCLC should be followed up once every three to six months in the first three years after radical surgery, once every six months in the fourth and fifth years, and annually thereafter. The frequency of follow-up should be increased as needed when new clinical symptoms arise (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). Evidence summary: One systematic review, two RCTs, and eight retrospective studies all supported regular postoperative follow-up for patients with NSCLC.[ In terms of follow-up assessments, IFCT-0302 reported that although standard postoperative chest CT examination did not significantly improve OS in patients with stage I\u2013IIIA NSCLC compared to chest X-ray (HR = 0.95, 95% CI, 0.83-1.10; P = 0.49), it was able to detect more early recurrences (32.6% vs. 27.7%) and second primary LC (4.5% vs. 3.0%),[ thus supporting a follow-up strategy based on chest CT. Several retrospective studies also provided supporting evidence for conducting postoperative head MRI/CT, abdominal MRI/CT, whole-body bone scans, and tumor biomarker testing (e.g., carcinoembryonic antigen [CEA]). On the contrary, one RCT and two cohort studies found no advantage in using positron emission tomography (PET)/CT over chest CT for monitoring LC recurrence.[ In examining whether the frequency of postoperative follow-up for patients with NSCLC should vary based on disease stage, a systematic review of nine studies showed that a higher follow-up frequency after radical surgery for LC did not significantly improve survival (HR = 0.83, 95% CI, 0.66\u20131.05; P = 0.13) but did increase the early detection of tumor recurrence and second primary LC.[ Since patients with stage II\u2013III NSCLC have a higher risk of recurrence compared to those with stage I NSCLC, a more intensive follow-up schedule would facilitate the early detection of tumor recurrence and second primary LC. Rationale for recommendation: The purpose of postoperative follow-up after radical LC resection is to facilitate the early identification of tumor recurrence or second primary LC, providing timely interventions and enhancing patient survival and quality of life. The chest is the most common site of recurrence and metastasis following LC surgery; thus, chest CT should be the primary assessment conducted in postoperative follow-up. Furthermore, additional site-specific examinations are recommended for common sites of systemic metastasis. Although PET/CT exhibits similar sensitivity and specificity to CT, its cost and radiation exposure outweigh the benefits; therefore, PET/CT is not recommended for routine postoperative monitoring. There remains a lack of consistent evidence to support the routine detection of blood tumor biomarkers in postoperative follow-up for NSCLC. Elevated CEA levels may be associated with poor outcomes and can be re-measured as needed. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) may serve as effective markers for monitoring early NSCLC recurrence. Although ctDNA can indicate potential recurrence sooner than imaging methods, its ability to provide a survival benefit has yet to be established, and it is not routinely included in postoperative follow-up due to its high cost. A more frequent follow-up schedule is recommended for patients with stage II\u2013III NSCLC due to their higher risk of recurrence compared to those with stage I NSCLC.", "type": "Document"}

Evidence summary: We identified two multicenter, prospective, observational studies and nine single-center, prospective, observational studies pertaining to this topic.[ The results showed that postoperative MRD positivity was significantly associated with a high risk of recurrence and shorter RFS/DFS, necessitating close follow-up and management.

The impact of social confinement and the interruption of this surgery on the population with obesity has been underestimated, with weight gain and worsened comorbidities. Some candidates for this surgery are exposed to a high risk of mortality linked to the pandemic. Obesity and diabetes are two major risk factors for severe forms of Covid-19. The only currently effective treatment for obesity is metabolic surgery, which confers prompt, lasting benefits. It is thus necessary to resume such surgery. To ensure that this resumption is both gradual and well-founded, we have devised a priority ranking plan. The flow charts we propose will help centres to identify priority patients according to a benefit/risk assessment. Diabetes holds a central place in the decision tree. Resumption patterns will vary from one centre to another according to human, physical and medical resources, and will need adjustment as the epidemic unfolds. Specific informed consent will be required. Screening of patients with obesity should be considered, based on available knowledge. If Covid-19 is suspected, surgery must be postponed. Emphasis must be placed on infection control measures to protect patients and healthcare professionals. Confinement is strongly advocated for patients for the first month post-operatively.

The expected duration of the pandemic is uncertain (vaccine unavailable in the short term), acquired immunity is unsure (short-lived antibodies), and obesity and comorbidity rates have been increasing. De-scheduling and confining have numerous adverse effects, including psychological harms, injudicious dietary behaviour, and lack of physical exercise To mitigate these harms arising from the epidemic and the resulting confinement, and to better prepare this vulnerable section of the population for an extension of the epidemic, there is an obvious real need to resume weight-loss surgery. It is therefore urgent to set guidelines for the gradual resumption of surgical care, especially as the conventional indications for this surgery based on BMI reflect neither the severity of the obesity nor the urgency or semi-urgency of some indications. The SOFFCO-MM tasked an expert working group with addressing these questions in readiness for the resumption of surgery. The aim of these guidelines is to cogently rank the urgency of rescheduling surgery based on evidence-based criteria, benefit/risk ratios and clinical good sense.", "type": "Document"}

In what setting?\nResumption of surgical care must allow for a possible \u2018second wave\u2019 or medium-term extension of the epidemic after confinement measures are lifted. An extreme vigilance is necessary concerning the indicators that govern response to reduce the risk of peri-operative Covid-19 infection:\u2022access to Intensive care (IC) after the crisis;\u2022replication rate of the virus less than 1 outside epidemic peaks;\u2022access to operating room: several factors hinder access to the operating room. Physical distancing measures in healthcare centres reduce the fluidity and availability of accommodation (which depends on policy decisions made by the centre) and there may also be shortages of medical drugs (independently of the centre and the healthcare professionals). There are two contrasting strategies by which weight-loss surgery can be resumed. Each has its justifications, its advantages, and its drawbacks. \u2022strategy 1 (\u2018benefit outweighs risk\u2019) is based on the severity scores for each pathology. Several studies propose prioritizing indications by considering the degree of severity of the associated comorbidities and the socioeconomic impact \u2022strategy 2 (\u2018safe and preventive\u2019), conversely, consists in operating only on patients at low operative risk to achieve a longer-term benefit. To guide decision-making during this unprecedented health crisis, the SOFFCO-MM set objectives according to means:\u2022make as little use of IC beds as possible by selecting patients whose expected surgical complication rates will be low;\u2022perform bariatric surgery on those categories of patient whose state of health will deteriorate in the medium term without surgical care;\u2022resume this surgical care equally in both public and private sectors;\u2022do not operate on Covid+ patients or patients with known Covid+ history (given the current lack of evidence for effective immunization). Strategy 3 advocated by the SOFFCO ( Decision of multidisciplinary concertation meeting:\u2022already validated;\u2022being validated. Indication (further criterion to be added to the multidisciplinary concertation file to qualify for priority ranking):\u2022diabetes: \u2218time since diagnosis < 3 years, or,\u2218needing insulin treatment, or,\u2218with equilibration difficulties, or; \u2022comorbidities (other than diabetes): \u2218\u2265 2 comorbidities, or,\u22181 severe comorbidity, or; \u2022waiting for other important treatment (organ transplant, joint prosthesis, medically assisted procreation), or;\u2022with specific symptoms that can be improved by surgery because they are resistant to medical treatment (gastro-oesophageal reflux, pain, dysphagia, etc.). The priority criteria proposed are established according to the severity of the comorbidities and the benefit/risk ratios for surgery. These criteria are tools to guide resumption of bariatric surgery. They are to be weighted according to the local status of the epidemic, the types of patients in each centre, and the procedures envisaged. There will be disparities between patients from one centre to another. Some centres will have small numbers of group A patients ( Each bariatric surgery centre will have a list of patients whose indications have been validated by multidisciplinary concertation after a preparation lasting more than 6 months. The ways in which care will be resumed will vary from one centre to another according to the human, physical, and medication resources of each entity. No guidelines are therefore given concerning care resumption thresholds. The priority is to avoid having to deny care. Patients on waiting lists are to be re-contacted by the multidisciplinary teams to keep in touch, continue follow-up and prepare them for surgery. The objectives are weight control with weight stability, stabilization of any comorbidities, particularly in patients with diabetes, and achievement of optimal blood sugar levels.

Morbidity rates are lower than for secondary surgery irrespective of the type of surgery Concerning secondary surgery, a distinction must be made between surgery for weight regain or insufficient weight loss, and surgery for complications and/or sequelae of earlier surgery. Concerning secondary surgery for weight loss, the best strategy would be to wait for the pandemic/epidemic to abate locally or regionally. As explained above, such surgery has an increased rate of complications and very wide-ranging weight loss results according to the technique and the indication. Continued nutritional and/or psychological follow-up by telemedicine offers a good alternative that can help optimise and/or maintain preparation for later surgery. Concerning secondary surgery for complications or for secondary effects of earlier weight-loss surgery, there are several distinct cases. First, the indications when there is a short-term threat to life, e.g., the presence of a chronic post-operative digestive fistula resistant to endoscopic treatment. In this type of indication, the alternative with continued endoscopic treatment may be hazardous after a certain time lag, with the appearance of other even worse complications For indications where there is no short-term threat to life, it is preferable to have recourse to surgery at a time when the epidemic is at a lull, and if medical treatment has failed. For example:\u2022in the case of disabling reflux after sleeve gastrectomy, medical treatment by continued hygiene and diet measures, continued treatment by a proton pump inhibitor associated or not with antacids;\u2022in the case of severe de-nutrition when revision or reversal surgery is envisaged, it is preferable to defer the operation and continue with nutritional support of the enteral or parenteral nutrition type that can be given at home. Concerning robot-assisted bariatric surgery, no literature data contraindicate this type of surgical approach. The choice of this support over a conventional laparoscopic approach will depend on the surgeon's experience in robot-assisted surgery.", "type": "Document"}

The advent of a complication and the emergency it may create can upset this regulation. It is essential to dissuade patients from coming to the hospital for no good reason, but also to ensure that any complication underestimated by a patient does not evolve threateningly.

Minimising peri\u2010operative blood loss:3Management of anticoagulants in the peri\u2010operative period should balance the risk of bleeding with the risk of thrombosis.4The use of cell salvage and antifibrinolytics, such as tranexamic acid, is recommended in all patients who are bleeding, where blood loss > 500 ml (> 8 ml.kg\u20101 in children weighing > 10 kg) is possible and/or in patients are unable to receive donor blood.5Minimise iatrogenic anaemia by managing blood sampling appropriately. Recognition and management of major bleeding:Early recognition of obstetric bleeding is essential and should be measured accumulatively, leading to a clear escalation plan of intervention and involvement of the multidisciplinary team.Every institution should have a major haemorrhage protocol which is regularly audited and reviewed. They should be concise but targeted, and allow for immediate release and protocolised administration of blood components.In an emergency, surgical implementation of damage/proximal control strategies may be required until haemorrhage control is achieved.Group O red blood cells (RBCs) for transfusion should be readily available in the clinical area, in case haemorrhage is life\u2010threatening. Group\u2010specific RBCs should be made available by the laboratory as soon as possible after receiving correctly labelled samples and being informed of the emergency requirement for blood, and according to local laboratory protocols.During major haemorrhage due to trauma, preference should be given to transfusing RBCs and fresh frozen plasma (FFP). Clear fluids (crystalloids) should be avoided unless there is profound hypotension and no imminent availability of blood components.Blood components should be prescribed for children as a volume (ml.kg\u20101) rather than in units.Patients who continue to bleed actively should be monitored by point\u2010of\u2010care and/or regular laboratory tests for coagulation, fibrinogen and platelet counts and/or function.

These dovetail with general trauma systems publications; however, these guidelines address all income spectrums and not just high\u2010income well\u2010resourced environments.

(The papers are found as https://doi.org/10.1002/wjs.70002 and https://doi.org/10.1002/wjs.70004 in the World Journal of Surgery.) 33. Ethics in ICU 33a. Palliative care PICO: For trauma patients what is the best practice to provide advanced palliative care? Devastating injuries require both urgent assessment by a trauma service and early attention to patients' goals of care (GOC). The American College of Surgeons Trauma Quality Improvement Program (ACS\u2010TQIP) evidence\u2010based guidelines recommend an initial palliative assessment within 24 h of admission and family meeting, if needed, within 72 h to determine patient wishes and GOC [ Essential components of post\u2010trauma palliative care include effective communication and support around prognosis, and treatment options; psychosocial, emotional, and spiritual care; early and continuous assessment and treatment of pain, discomfort, and anxiety; and ongoing support of the patient and family. Although all trauma patients in the ICU should undergo screening for palliative care needs, certain considerations increase the likelihood that a palliative care intervention is indicated including severe traumatic injury with either the high risk of in\u2010hospital mortality, permanent disability, or functional outcome incompatible with patient's wishes. Prior health and functional status should be assessed [ Of the many hypothesized predictors of palliation, injury severity was the only tangible independent predictor. A persistent disconnect exists between the patient's wishes via living wills or advanced directives \u2018in a terminal condition\u2019 and fulfillment during end\u2010of\u2010life (EOL) decision\u2010making. This speaks to the complex nature of EOL decisions and the need for a multidisciplinary approach [ Elderly injured patients with significant comorbidities may also benefit from early palliative care. One study demonstrated that palliative care utilization was very high for older trauma patients who died in hospital. In contrast, the majority of those who were discharged alive, but with poor outcomes, did not have palliative care [ 33a. Summary and recommendations: Early implementation of palliative care in patients with severe injury with an anticipated high risk of hospital mortality, permanent disability, or functional outcome incompatible with patient's wishes is advised. Prior health and pre\u2010injury functional status should be assessed. Standardized screening protocols and order sets increase compliance with timely palliative care intervention. We recommend an initial palliative assessment within 24 h of admission and a family meeting, if needed, within 72 h of admission to the ICU. Level of evidence: Moderate Strength of recommendation: Strong 33b. Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) 33b. What is the best practice to review and implement DNR orders in the trauma patient? The purpose of a do not attempt resuscitation (DNAR) order is to prevent unnecessary and potentially harmful attempts of providing a therapy that may not be beneficial, especially in patients with an irreversible or terminal clinical condition [ Historically, full revocation of perioperative DNAR was accepted, especially among polytrauma patients in an \u2018emergency\u2019 situation. Examples included auto enforcement, misinterpretation of intentions, and a one\u2010size\u2010fits\u2010all approach that may not have always aligned with patient preferences. Such approaches undermine the goal of shared decision\u2010making [ Even in time sensitive circumstances, it is best practice to provide the patient or their designated surrogate, a clear discussion of the proposed treatment, therapeutic and non\u2010therapeutic options in the event of an intraoperative cardiac arrest, and the opportunity to refuse treatment in the event of an arrest. It is imperative to also document the conversation in the patient's medical record. The conversation between the patient, anesthesia, and surgeon should be clear without ambiguity. In the event of an agreeable temporary suspension of DNAR, it should be well documented when the perioperative period ends (e.g., immediately post\u2010operative or within 24 h [ Surgical, anesthesia, and nursing societies have all published consensus guidelines around DNAR [ 33b. Summary and recommendations: We recommend implementation of DNAR orders in the trauma patient when appropriate and within the confines of local legal policies. This includes required validation or reconsideration, clear communication, and a timeline for DNAR reinitiation if it is temporarily suspended. Level of evidence: High Level of recommendation: Strong 33c. Advanced Care Planning PICO: In trauma patients with severe injury, what is the recommended approach to advanced care planning, whether for palliation or otherwise? Advanced care planning (ACP) is the process of discussing and documenting patients' preferences and values for future medical care, especially in the event of life\u2010threatening illness or injury and for informing the patient or the family of the predicted course of progress and prognosis. ACP can improve the quality of care and reduce unwanted interventions, conflicts, and stress for patients, families, and health care providers. However, ACP is often neglected or delayed for trauma patients, who may face sudden and unpredictable situations that require complex and time\u2010sensitive decisions [ Barriers to ACP can be patient\u2010related, provider\u2010related, and system\u2010related factors. The most common patient\u2010related barriers include lack of awareness or understanding of ACP, reluctance or difficulty to discuss end\u2010of\u2010life issues, uncertainty or variability of preferences, and cultural or religious beliefs. The most common provider\u2010related barriers include lack of time or opportunity, lack of training or confidence, lack of communication or collaboration, and ethical or legal concerns. The most common system\u2010related factors include ACP champions, provision of education, use of standardized protocols or guidelines, cultural variability, and recognition of triggers or cues. All patients should be screened and those with poor prognosis or other factors that may require care limitation proceed to a formal process. Identification of advanced care plans should begin at the entry portal of the emergency resuscitation room. Triggers to identify patient care preferences should be utilized, especially in healthcare systems that support pre\u2010arrival patient care preference. One retrospective study demonstrated the opportunities to avoid unwanted care in concordance with patient preference and develop a protocolized approach [ Based on the trauma quality improvement project (TQIP), Hwang et al. found that implementation of the TQIP best practices for palliative care and advanced care planning resulted in improvement in documentation of a GOC discussion within 72 h (17%\u201383%, p < 0.0001) and DNR orders placed more frequently (9% vs. 17%, p = 0.098) [ 33c. Summary and recommendation: Implementation of advanced care planning on admission and within 72 h of hospitalization is recommended. This can facilitate concordance of patient care wishes, family engagement and appropriate patient focused care. Implementation results in a higher proportion of pre\u2010existing decisions being documented and reflected in future care of the trauma patient and avoidance of unwanted care. Level of evidence: Moderate Strength of recommendation: Strong 34. Frailty index 34. PICO In frail and elderly trauma patients, what is the best assessment and treatment approach to optimize outcome? Frail and elderly trauma patients are a vulnerable population that require special attention and care. They have higher mortality and morbidity rates, longer hospital stays, and lower functional outcomes than younger trauma patients. Frail and elderly trauma patients have complex and diverse needs that require a holistic and comprehensive approach to assessment and treatment with the involvement of geriatricians and hospital specialists [ Multiple objective measure scales may be utilized to screen frail and elderly trauma patients [ Multidisciplinary collaboration is essential for delivering optimal and coordinated care for frail and elderly trauma patients. The involvement of a geriatric trauma service (GTS) can facilitate the communication and integration of various disciplines such as surgery, emergency medicine, geriatrics, nursing, pharmacy, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, social work, and nutrition. The GTS can also provide education and training for staff and implement evidence\u2010based protocols and guidelines for the management of this population. Trauma patients that receive geriatric trauma consultation are more likely to be discharged home (OR: 2.01 [95% CI: 1.24\u20133.24]) [ 34. Summary and recommendations: Trauma specific frailty screening scores are useful in advanced care planning. We cannot recommend one specific scoring system over another, but do recommend that an objective measure should be utilized. When possible, a geriatric trauma consultative service should be utilized to improve the best possible outcomes for elderly and frail patients. Level of evidence: Moderate Grade of recommendation: Strong 35. Post\u2010Traumatic Stress Disorder after major trauma 35. PICO: In patients who survive major trauma or polytrauma what is the risk of PTSD and how can this be prevented and treated? Post\u2010traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is not uncommon after major physical trauma (severe trauma and polytrauma) and is not a new phenomenon. First elucidated in 2008 in Australia it appears to be more associated with causal blame assignment than the actual injury severity [ 35. Summary and recommendations: PTSD is common at 6\u201312 months post major trauma and treatment is a combination of psychotherapy, and pharmacotherapy adjusted to response. Prevention is difficult, but screening is recommended. Level of evidence: Moderate Level of recommendation: Strong 36. Systems and organizational aspects 36a. PICO: What is the evidence of benefit of trauma systems and does centralization of trauma offer advantages in outcomes? Trauma Systems were first promulgated in the late 1980's by Trunkey and have been established in varying degrees and with different philosophical approaches across many nations [ Centralization of services appears to have both benefits to patient outcome for the most severely injured, yet may adversely affect the confidence (and skills) of practitioners not working in designated trauma centers in terms of the decision\u2010making and treatment of moderate and less severe trauma [ 36b. PICO: What is the status of development of ideal trauma systems versus real life in different countries, with different health systems, including in LMICs. For most LMIC's the development of trauma systems are in their infancy, but must be designed around the local health care system capability and not simply by copying HIC trauma care models [ 36c. PICO: What is the optimal time to transfer for rural and other trauma patients in non\u2010trauma hospitals to avoid under\u2010 or overtriage? Does aeromedical transport offer benefits? Whereas trauma is best managed by experts, rural patients and those who are admitted to \u2018non\u2010designated\u2019 trauma hospitals appear to have delayed access to care and worse related outcome measures [ Triage using pre\u2010defined criteria aim to get the most severely injured patient to the most advanced care facility in the shortest timeframe and this has been shown to improve outcome; however, this often leads to overtriage and may necessitate unnecessary interfacility transfers leading to system overload at the pinnacle of the system\u2014the level 1 (or equivalent) trauma center [ Current high\u2010quality methodology systematic reviews and an in\u2010process EPOC\u2010Cochrane review suggest there remains low\u2010quality evidence for the effectiveness of inclusive trauma systems (over exclusive systems) and very\u2010low\u2010quality evidence for aeromedical injury mortality reduction, but timely transfer in rural and other extreme locations, compared to limited benefit in urban environments. Research should be directed to the recommended components of trauma systems and non\u2010fatal outcomes and explore whether system component interactions improve outcomes [ 36d. PICO: Does police and public scoop and run improve outcomes as compared to waiting for Emergency Services? Where urban penetrating trauma is prevalent, there is moderate evidence that for certain mechanisms (penetrating chest trauma and gunshot wounds), waiting for EMS is not beneficial and police or other personal vehicle transport to the nearest trauma center is associated with better survival [ 36e. What systems of care should be offered for the older trauma patient with major trauma or polytrauma? Trauma in the older patient is associated with many challenges, not least of which is the risk of under\u2010triage by health care providers from the scene to the hospital level of care. The existing guidelines do identify the most at\u2010risk patients, although triage tools may miss severe trauma in the older patient [ Frailty scores and injury patterns should be aligned with age and physiology to dictate both treatment and where indicated palliation [ 36. Summary and recommendations: Trauma systems do improve outcome but require the entire inclusive system to cooperate for the benefit of the patient. Systems must be developed that are locally relevant and that do not simply copy HIC models as the only option. However, the generic elements are the same. Triage to the correct level of care avoids overloading the system, whereas for select injuries direct transfer avoiding EMS may improve outcome. Rural aeromedical systems are beneficial but not urban helicopter transport. 36a. and 36b. Level of evidence: Trauma systems and development/maturity: Moderate Grade of recommendation: Strong 36c. Level of evidence: Triage, transfer to centralized care and aeromedical transfer: Moderate Grade of recommendation: Strong 36d. Level of evidence: Non\u2010EMS transport penetrating trauma: Low Grade of recommendation: Weak 36e. Level of evidence: Moderate Grade of recommendation: Strong 37. Pediatric\u2010specific considerations 37. PICO: Pediatric considerations are inserted where appropriate in main text. What is the role of pediatric trauma centers vs pediatric trauma care in adult trauma centers? What is the ideal versus real life across the world? Appropriate treatment of pediatric trauma requires a multidisciplinary approach based on the anatomic, physiologic and social needs of children. On that background, the American College of Surgeons\u2010Committee on Trauma championed the creation of specific pediatric trauma centers [ 37. Summary and recommendations: There is no good evidence to support pediatric\u2010specific trauma centers outside a few high\u2010income countries and the local system must determine the most appropriate care for children. 37.

ERAS programs have expanded beyond colorectal surgery to other surgical disciplines and have been implemented successfully in pancreatic surgery, thoracic surgery, liver resection, urologic surgery, gynecologic surgery, and emergency surgery, among others [https://www.niaa-hsrc.org.uk/HSRC-COMPAC.

In developing the checklist, subcommittee members were asked to review 10\u201315 manuscripts each from anesthesia, surgery, or general interest journals and tasked to define best practices in ERAS reporting. Questions to be addressed were:How are the study groups defined?How do the authors convey the implementation of ERAS principles?What steps are taken to assess compliance?What outcomes are measured? This subcommittee developed an initial list of 32 items for inclusion in a checklist of best practices. After discussion with the larger committee, this number was reduced to 20 items to focus the checklist on elements related to ERAS rather than to general guidelines for best practices in research reporting. The total number of elements was reduced by removing those redundant with general reporting guidelines, for example the Enhancing QUAlity and Transparency Of health Research (EQUATOR) network guidelines, or by combining similar elements to make the checklist more concise [\u00ae Society Executive Committee (MJS, WJF, ND, DNL, and OLP) for further comments.

ERAS studies should refer to enhanced recovery within the title (item 1), which will facilitate queries for future systematic reviews. The title should also relay the study type and surgical procedure studied\u2014for example, a retrospective cohort study of patients undergoing robotic-assisted pancreaticoduodenectomies. In the introduction, the authors should explain the specific area of clinical uncertainty being addressed within the context of ERAS (item 2)\u2014for instance, whether high-volume or high-concentration local anesthetic provides superior local analgesia to the incision. As the ERAS\u00ae Society and other perioperative research societies have published guidelines for many procedures, existing guidelines, if applicable, should be referenced (item 3). The primary outcome for the study should be clearly stated in the introduction, as well as key secondary outcomes of interest (item 4). While many ERAS studies have focused on administrative outcomes, such as hospital length of stay, or clinical outcomes, such as wound infection or transfusion rates, there is considerable need for more ERAS studies addressing functional outcomes. The latter might include outcomes such as return to work or discharge to home rather than to a rehabilitation facility [ Within the materials and methods, all ERAS studies should describe the Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Ethics Committee review or explain the rationale for IRB/Ethics Committee exemption (item 5). The study design, including whether this is a prospective or retrospective study, should be evident (item 6). The design description should include details on the clinical context, including the setting (item 7), timing (item 8), and selection of patients (item 9) for the study. This includes the type of hospital, period of recruitment, and inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study. The authors should place the report temporally with respect to the introduction of ERAS at the institution (item 10), including differentiating pre-ERAS from post-ERAS groups of patients. An explicit statement regarding the dates of introduction of ERAS at the institution, if possible, is preferred. Paramount to ERAS-related studies is documentation that the principles of enhanced recovery are being followed (item 11). While the literature is rife with reports of ERAS failures, a closer inspection may reveal a lack of compliance with ERAS concepts [\u00ae Interactive Audit System\u00ae (EIAS\u00ae) or local databases. The report should include a list of the metrics that enter into the compliance calculation. Similarly, outcomes, both primary and secondary, should be clearly defined a priori (item 13), and whenever patient-reported outcomes (PROs) or surveys are introduced, these should use validated and referenced instruments (item 14). Results reporting in ERAS should reflect similar transparency to the methods. The reader should be able to visualize the derivation and composition of the study population (item 15). A description of the population should identify what proportion of all patients undergoing the procedure of interest is being reported and the reasons for exclusion from the study. The outcomes results should be displayed in the context of the actual compliance with the ERAS elements (item 16). Again, this requires an auditing system in place so that percentage compliance with the protocol can be plotted against the outcomes of interest. Whenever possible, regression analysis techniques should be used to test for independent associations between the primary outcome and the intervention under study (item 17). For example, in a study of ambulation from the postoperative recovery unit compared to ambulation on reaching the inpatient ward, where the primary outcome is actually the 6-minute walk test result at 2 weeks after surgery, a regression analysis should include confounders for early ambulation such as time of day, neuraxial analgesia, or receipt of opioids. The discussion of ERAS studies should place the work within the larger context of ERAS-related care (item 18). Authors should strive to link the findings with tangible opportunities to improve clinical practice. A study that shows a decrease in visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores from 5 to 4 is of much less impact on the field than a similar study that examines the proportion of patients discharged to home rather than to a rehabilitation facility. Authors sometimes consciously or subconsciously overinterpret the results of their study, that is, they add \u201cspin\u201d to the conclusions of a scientific report. Spin is defined as a non-neutral way of reporting that distorts the interpretation of results and misleads readers [", "type": "Document"}

Although the risk of major bleeding, in particular intracranial haemorrhage (ICH), is decreased with DOACs, gastrointestinal bleeding is increased with some DOACs, and the case fatality rate of bleeding remains high. Therefore, it is important to (i) prescribe DOACs appropriately, (ii) have strategies to manage major bleeding including the use of specific reversal agents and (iii) interrupt and resume DOACs for procedures. The main recommendations are as follows: (i) Select the appropriate dose of DOAC according to indications and consider patient factors to minimise bleeding risks; (ii) DOACs do not require routine laboratory testing; (iii) for life\u2010threatening uncontrollable bleeding, specific agents can be used to reverse the anticoagulant effects of DOACs; and (iv) DOACs can be interrupted for planned procedures without the need for \u2018bridging\u2019 with low\u2010molecular\u2010weight heparin (LMWH). The anticoagulant effects of DOACs can be reversed with specific agents, such as andexanet for apixaban and rivaroxaban and idarucizumab for dabigatran. If not available, pro\u2010haemostatic agents such as prothrombin complex concentrates or activated prothrombin complex concentrates can be considered.

Box 1Scenarios where use of direct oral anticoagulants is not advised. \u2020Apixaban, dabigatran and rivaroxaban are not recommended with CrCl <25 mL/min, <30 mL/min and <15 mL/min respectively.\u2021Apixaban is contraindicated in Child\u2010Pugh C; rivaroxaban in Child\u2010Pugh B and C; dabigatran with liver enzymes \u00d72 upper limit of normal.\u00a7Lupus anticoagulant (non\u2010specific inhibitor), anticardiolipin antibodies and anti\u2010B2 glycoprotein antibodies. The efficacy of DOACs has been established in multiple large, multicentre randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), chronic stable atherosclerotic disease and venous thromboembolism (VTE; including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE)) (GRADE 1A). The clearance of DOACs relies primarily on renal function, though the extent varies between the different DOACs. A careful assessment of risk\u2013benefit should be undertaken for use of DOACs in patients with CrCl <30 mL/min. In Australia and New Zealand, dose adjustment of dabigatran is recommended with CrCl \u226450 mL/min, with contraindication of use if CrCl \u226430 mL/min. Apixaban and rivaroxaban use is not recommended for CrCl <25 mL/min and CrCl <15 mL/min respectively. DOACs should also be used cautiously in patients with liver dysfunction (Box 2). Hence, the use of DOACs remains challenging in patients with significant renal or liver impairment, in low\u2010body\u2010weight and morbidly obese patients. DOACs have less drug\u2013drug interactions, but significant interactions can occur with medications which interact with P\u2010glycoprotein and/or CYP3A4. Combining antiplatelet drugs and certain other medicines with DOACs increases the risk of bleeding. Utilising online specific drug interaction checkers is highly recommended (https://amhonline.amh.net.au/). An important safety advantage reflected in all of the RCTs involving DOACs, and confirmed by meta\u2010analyses, is the significant reduction in intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) compared to warfarin. Compared to warfarin, the estimates of major bleeding are lower with DOACs overall (1%\u20134% per year). Finally, up to 10% of patients receiving long\u2010term anticoagulants require urgent or time\u2010critical procedures each year.

The timing of recommencement will depend on the severity of bleeding, the presence of ongoing risk factors for bleeding, the risk of thrombosis and the initial indication for anticoagulant therapy.Baseline laboratory assessment: The time of the last DOAC ingestion should be established (if known). Baseline assessment of haemoglobin should be performed to assess bleeding severity. Standard coagulation tests (aPTT, TT and PT) and, where available, anticoagulant\u2010specific drug level assessments should be performed to assess the contribution of the drug to the bleeding event and to guide the need for intervention. Creatinine should also be measured to assess renal function and allow prediction of expected rate of anticoagulant drug clearance.General supportive care measures: Patients with minor bleeding should be managed with local measures (e.g. mechanical compression). Surgical and radiological procedures to identify the bleeding source and to limit ongoing bleeding should be performed as appropriate, considering the risk of procedure\u2010related bleeding in an anticoagulated patient. Red cell transfusion should be administered as clinically appropriate. Platelet transfusion should be considered in patients on concurrent anti\u2010platelet therapy or with significant thrombocytopenia (platelets <50 \u00d7 109/L).Activated charcoal: Administration of activated charcoal should be considered in patients with moderate/severe bleeding who present within 2 h of the last dose of DOAC, although there is potential for efficacy up to 8 h after DOAC administrationAdministration of haemostatic agents: Where available, a drug\u2010specific reversal agent can be given for major, life\u2010threatening bleeding. In its absence, an alternative haemostatic agent may need to be considered. Four\u2010factor prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs) at a dose of 25\u201350 U/kg have been shown to be moderately effective in the treatment of patients on factor Xa inhibitors presenting with major bleeding (69.1%) with a low thromboembolic event rate (2.3%)Of all the DOACs, only dabigatran is removed by haemodialysis, but it is rarely performed because of the availability of idarucizumab.

The International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (ISPAD) clinical practice consensus guidelines 2022: Management of children and adolescents with diabetes requiring surgery was the predominant influence on informing these guidelines. A co-design approach was used in each phase of developing the guideline. Consumer groups, specialist groups and health care professionals (HCP) working with young people with diabetes mellitus were identified as key stakeholders. Consumer groups with lived experience provided young person-centric recommendations in each aspect of the guideline. Paediatric endocrinologists and general paediatricians with a diabetes interest in the Australia and New Zealand Society of Paediatric Endocrinology and Diabetes (ANZPED), and the New Zealand Paediatric Endocrine society (NZPES) and paediatric anaesthetists in the Society of Paediatric Anaesthesia in New Zealand and Australia (SPANZA) were consulted on both the draft and final versions of the guideline. This ensured the evidence-based recommendations were supported by current clinical practice. Feedback was sought from HCPs supporting young people with diabetes in the periprocedural period through the validation phase of the development of the guideline. After drafting the guideline, it was circulated among clinical networks and consumer stakeholders as previously described. Feedback was gathered from consumers and experts through electronic communications, departmental meetings, and conferences. A key gap identified was the lack of a family-facing checklist for healthcare professionals to use when planning procedures. In response, a checklist focusing on the use of pumps and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) during the pre-procedural period has been developed and is included in Appendix A (patient-facing checklist) and Appendix B (HCP checklist). Recommendations based on this feedback and supported by current evidence-based literature have been integrated into the draft guideline. Draft management flow diagrams were created based on the literature review and stakeholder feedback. A validation tool was then developed and distributed to HCPs who regularly interact with children and adolescents with diabetes during the periprocedural period. This tool included clinical vignettes with extended matching questions designed to align with the management flow diagrams. Iterative revisions were made based on the feedback received. The validation exercise targeted a range of HCPs, including surgical house officers, general paediatric registrars, anaesthetists, general paediatricians, endocrinologists, diabetes clinical nurse specialists, and registered nurses. Recruitment occurred through teaching sessions, annual meetings, and communications within clinical networks such as the New Zealand Clinical Network for Children and Young People with Diabetes and the Australia and New Zealand Society of Paediatric Endocrinology and Diabetes. Results were collected using the Qualtrics data tool and with simple descriptive statistics. Ethics approval was obtained from the University of Otago prior to data collection (Ethics reference #D23/192). The validation exercise, conducted using Qualtrics for data collection, received a total of 128 responses from various healthcare professionals: surgical and paediatric house officers (5) , general paediatric registrars (23), senior medical officers (57), diabetes clinical nurse specialists and nurse practitioners (6) , and registered nurses (7) . The mean correct response rate was 83% (ranging from 9 to 99%, with a standard deviation of 9.6), and the median was 96%. Notably, Clinical Vignette 2, which involved a patient with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) requiring emergency surgery, had a correct response rate of only 9% due to a failure to recognize the need for \u201cemergency surgery.\u201d Based on these results and additional feedback, improvements were made to the clinical pathways. A final draft with the feedback integrated from the validation exercises and from key stakeholders was circulated, before being submitted for publication.

These guidelines represent a significant shift from previous approaches, prioritizing tumor biology over anatomical features as the primary indication for resection. Condensed herein, they provide a practical management algorithm for clinical practice. However, the guidelines also highlight the need to redefine LA-PDAC to align with modern treatment strategies and to solve some contradictions within the current definition, such as grouping \"difficult\" and \"impossible\" to resect tumors together. Furthermore, the REDISCOVER guidelines highlight several areas requiring urgent research. These include the resection of the superior mesenteric artery, the management strategies for patients with LA-PDAC who are fit for surgery but unable to receive multi-agent neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the approach to patients with LA-PDAC who are fit for surgery but demonstrate high serum Ca 19.9 levels even after neoadjuvant treatment, and the optimal timing and number of chemotherapy cycles prior to surgery. Additionally, the role of primary chemoradiotherapy versus chemotherapy alone in LA-PDAC, the timing of surgical resection post-neoadjuvant/primary chemoradiotherapy, the efficacy of ablation therapies, and the management of oligometastasis in patients with LA-PDAC warrant investigation.

This heightened mortality rate is predominantly attributed to early hematogenous spread and intrinsic resistance to conventional oncological treatments. Consequently, distant metastases are frequently detectable at the time of diagnosis in approximately 60% of patients, rendering curative resection of the primary tumor unattainable. Tumor size stands out as a key prognostic factor in resected PDAC. While larger tumor sizes increase the risk of distant metastases, such metastases can also manifest in up to one-third of patients with tumors measuring 0.5 cm or less. Given the significant morbidity and mortality associated with pancreatic resection, surgical intervention is generally reserved for patients with localized disease [ Localized PDAC can be classified into three subgroups: resectable, borderline resectable (BR-PDAC), and locally advanced (LA-PDAC). These categories are based on the degree of vascular involvement and the probability of achieving a margin-negative resection. BR-PDAC and LA-PDAC comprise approximately one-third of all PDAC cases. Recently, the concept of anatomical resectability has been expanded to include biologic resectability, primarily assessed by levels of Ca 19-9, and conditional resectability, which considers the patient's overall health status and any comorbidities. The contemporary approach to resectability in pancreatic cancer integrates these concepts into what is commonly referred to as the A, B, C criteria [ Recent advancements in chemotherapy have shifted the focus towards the biologic aspect of resectability, leading to the emergence of \"prognosis-based resectability\", also known as conversion surgery [ The recent REDISCOVER guidelines have issued a consensus document endorsing a prognosis-based approach to resection in PDAC over an anatomy-based approach, while also offering insights into perioperative care specifics. However, the level of evidence supporting these recommendations was predominantly low, and several issues could not be endorsed due to insufficient evidence or reservations about incorporating avant-garde strategies into the guideline document [ This second report from the REDISCOVER consensus meeting aims to introduce a management algorithm for BR-PDAC and LA-PDAC Additionally, it addresses the questions that were not approved, highlighting the most crucial areas for future research.

At least in part, the low level of evidence is explained by many studies reporting on BR-PDAC and LA-PDAC as a unique entity. Discussions at the consensus conferences also demonstrated that current definitions of BR-PDAC and LA-PDAC are rather subjective and lack clear prognostic implications. Possibly, newer definitions of BR-PDAC and LA-PDAC should be provided that best match the dynamic view of PDAC \"stage\" based on response to primary and neoadjuvant oncology treatments. Indeed, the primary message from the REDISCOVER guidelines is that the more dynamic and, to some extent, logical concept of tumor biology predicting prognosis has superseded the static paradigm of vascular involvement as a marker of poor prognosis/unresectability. On the other hand, our understanding of PDAC biology is still incomplete. Chemotherapy response is currently employed as a surrogate marker of good tumor biology; nevertheless, some patients who appear to respond well to oncology therapies still have early tumor recurrence and are unlikely to benefit from radical resection. The use of molecular biomarkers appears to be the most sensible development of the biological selection theory [ In light of the REDISCOVER guidelines, the need to resect peripancreatic vessels after neoadjuvant oncology treatments should be mainly considered a marker of technical difficulty without clear prognostic implications. While adding further technical complexity to pancreatectomy increases the incidence and severity of postoperative complications, several recent studies have shown improved results even in patients requiring arterial resection [ It is crucial to underscore that there comes a point where technical complexity, the patient's physiological status, and the prognostic outlook must be considered collectively. In other words, when anticipating high surgical difficulty in patients with less than optimal performance status and/or tumors exhibiting intermediate biology, the decision to proceed with tumor resection should be discouraged regardless of technical feasibility. These factors should be thoroughly discussed and openly weighed when obtaining informed consent for resection.", "type": "Document"}

However, pancreatectomy with resection and reconstruction of the superior mesenteric artery (PRR-SMA) could not be recommended because of lack of consensus after the audience vote (72%). The majority of experts had agreed on PRR-SMA on the online Delphi rounds (88%).

Data should be recorded in international registries, such as the REDISCOVER registry, or reported in prospective observational studies. Diffusion of PRR-SMA is unlikely to occur quickly, but denying resection solely because of lack of surgical experience should be carefully considered.

However, it may not adequately address local disease control in all patients. Primary chemoradiotherapy combines the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy with the locoregional control provided by radiotherapy. In theory, it should be beneficial for LA-PDAC where achieving local disease control is a priority. Studies evaluating primary chemoradiotherapy in LA-PDAC have shown promising results in terms of local tumor response, downstaging, and achieving negative surgical margins. However, chemoradiotherapy does not seem to improve overall survival. A meta-analysis of 5 randomized controlled trials revealed that chemoradiotherapy did not confer a survival advantage compared to chemotherapy alone but increased the rates of grade 3 to 4 adverse events [ Some patients receive primary chemotherapy followed by consolidation radiotherapy. Although these patients are not initially considered surgical candidates, some of them may eventually undergo surgery due to stable disease and good clinical conditions. However, surgery in these patients is technically more complex due to the consolidation of radiotherapy effects into retroperitoneal scarring tissue. Whenever possible, radiotherapy should be used for neoadjuvant purposes. The choice of oncological treatment in LA-PDAC is often based on the practices and preferences of individual institutions.

Initially, metastases may be microscopic and undetectable. Once metastases become visible, regardless of their number, the disease is considered systemic, and treatment typically revolves around chemotherapy. The concept of oligometastasis has emerged as a result of recent advancements in oncology. In this scenario, the number and sites of metastases are limited making localized cancer treatments of potential benefit. Examples include liver metastases from colorectal cancer, lung metastases from various primary tumors, and adrenal metastases from lung cancer [ In PDAC, metastases are primarily found in the liver, peritoneum, or lungs. Lung metastases may exhibit a less aggressive biological behavior. Resection of isolated lung metastases in PDAC is already considered a treatment option for carefully selected patients [ In LA-PDAC, the concept of oligometastasis has not been extensively explored, likely due to concerns regarding the complexity of surgery. Furthermore, when metastases were initially occult, distinguishing between synchronous metastases that responded to treatment and metastases that developed despite oncology treatments can be challenging. Future studies should endeavor to establish a clear definition of oligometastasis in PDAC and elucidate its prognostic implications and treatment options, particularly for LA-PDAC.", "type": "Document"}

This manuscript presents a management algorithm derived from these guidelines and discusses unresolved clinical questions. The REDISCOVER guidelines unequivocally mark a shift in the indication for resection of BR-PDAC and LA-PDAC, prioritizing tumor biology over anatomical features as the primary indication for resection. These guidelines also underscore the necessity of revising the anatomical definition of LA-PDAC, as shown by the discrepancy in surgical recommendations based on involvement of the celiac trunk versus the superior mesenteric artery. Furthermore, the current definition of LA-PDAC includes the scenario of an unreconstructible superior mesenteric/portal vein, signifying the tumor as unresectable by definition, regardless of considerations about treatment response and tumor biology. Finally, the new definition should aim to establish a clearer distinction between BR-PDAC and LA-PDAC. Finally, it is important to refine existing management strategies. The establishment of the REDISCOVER registry (https://rediscover.unipi.it/) holds promise as a unified research platform aimed at advancing our understanding and improving the management of BR-PDAC and LA-PDAC.\n", "type": "Document"}

Traditional contrast-based cholangiography would be the panel\u2019s first choice. However, given the proliferation of intraoperative biliary imaging techniques, if intraoperative cholangiography cannot be performed due to access or experience, the panel encouraged the use of other techniques, such as minimally invasive ultrasound or fluorescence-based cholangiography. The panel discussed the routine versus selective use of cholangiography based on the patient\u2019s history, laboratory studies, and imaging findings. The consensus was to suggest the use of routine cholangiogram when gastric bypass anatomy is present based on the unique opportunity to complete a transcystic exploration at the time of cholecystectomy should choledocholithiasis be confirmed. Surgeons performing these studies should have the ability to intervene on biliary stones identified during imaging. This may involve simple flushing of the cholangiography catheter with the use of glucagon, endoscopic interventions utilizing SpyGlass-type technology, formal common bile duct (CBD) exploration, or even on-table ERCP in collaboration with a gastroenterologist.

Nearly every patient with GERD following sleeve gastrectomy will trial medical therapy prior to discussing surgical revision specifically for GERD, which the panel feels is completely appropriate. The question becomes less clear when patients have medically refractory GERD. If surgical intervention is being considered and a hiatal hernia is present, this should be addressed at the time of surgery for the clear benefit of re-establishing normal distal esophageal anatomy. For patients with insufficient treatment response post-sleeve and BMI > 35, conversion to a malabsorptive bariatric procedure seems the most reasonable approach to address both problems with one operation. Similarly, such patients who also have a hiatal hernia should undergo repair of the hiatal hernia at the time of conversion to bypass-type anatomy. For medically refractory patients with a BMI between 30 and 35, MSA and conversion to gastric bypass may both be reasonable options depending on individual patient characteristics and values. Patients at this BMI range with associated metabolic diseases may derive greater benefit from conversion to gastric bypass. Similarly, patients of Asian descent at this BMI range may derive greater benefit from conversion to gastric bypass as there is evidence they tend to develop metabolic syndrome at a lower BMI threshold than other patients [ Patients with a BMI less than 30 may undergo MSA or gastric bypass as well. The potential for malnutrition in this patient population must be discussed extensively prior to proceeding with gastric bypass. As mentioned above, in selected patients with GERD and a hiatal hernia after sleeve gastrectomy, hiatal hernia repair alone may be sufficient. All patients considering undergoing a second metabolic operation should be evaluated in a multidisciplinary fashion, just as they were prior to their first operation.

Postoperative UTI/genital tract infection (GTI) is often difficult to clearly classify as either SSI or RI and should be treated independently as a UTI/GTI. Explanation: Perioperative infections are generally defined as infections that develop within 1 month of an invasive procedure such as surgery or examinations. Perioperative infections are broadly classified into SSI, which occur at sites of surgery or procedures, and RI, which occur at sites not directly related to the surgical site. The definition of SSIs widely used today is based on the guidelines published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 1999 [ However, in the field of urology, where many surgical operations and procedures manipulate the urinary tract directly, there is no consensus on how to classify postoperative UTI/GTI. For example, there may be no major objection to classifying UTIs that occur after transurethral endoscopic procedures such as transurethral resection of prostate (TURP), transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT), and transurethral ureterolithotripsy (TUL) as SSIs. However, it is questionable whether all UTIs/GTIs such as prostatitis, epididymitis, and pyelonephritis can be classified as SSIs in these surgeries. Considering the unique nature of many open/laparoscopic urologic surgeries, including transurethral endoscopic surgeries, it is difficult to clearly classify postoperative UTIs as either SSIs or RIs. It is also difficult to reach a consensus on whether UTIs occurring when ureteral catheters are removed long after urinary diversion, pyeloplasty, or other reconstructive procedures of the urinary tract should be counted as perioperative infections. Therefore, in the field of urology, postoperative UTIs such as pyelonephritis and cystitis, and male GTIs such as prostatitis and epididymitis, should be reported as UTI/GTI rather than classified as SSI or RI.", "type": "Document"}

Intraoperatively, additional doses are recommended to maintain adequate antimicrobial blood levels (EL; IVa, RG; B). Explanation: The CDC guidelines published in 1999 specify that initial antimicrobials should be administered so that blood and tissue antimicrobial concentrations at the site of the surgical procedure are sufficient to prevent the growth of contaminating bacteria at the time of skin incision [ The CDC guidelines suggest that adequate blood and tissue levels of prophylactic antimicrobial agents from the time of surgery to several hours after the procedure is completed are useful for SSI prophylaxis [", "type": "Document"}

If there is no disadvantage in postponing the surgery, consider postponing the surgery until the treatment of the infection is completed. Explanation: Urologic surgery is characterized by the high likelihood of entering the urogenital tract or by the direct insertion of an endoscope into the urinary tract. Preoperative UTIs may increase the incidence of postoperative SSIs and UTIs due to urinary bacterial contamination of the surgical site. It has been reported that bacteriuria at the time of surgery increases the frequency of postoperative infection in transurethral surgeries such as TURBT and TURP, and in clean\u2010contaminated surgeries involving the urinary tract such as radical prostatectomy [ When surgery has to be performed with complications of UTI, the use of antimicrobial agents should not be covered by the recommendation in this guideline because such urologic procedures are treated as dirty\u2010infected surgery. The antimicrobial susceptibility of the bacteria causing UTI should be confirmed, and antimicrobial agents according to the results should be administered preoperatively. If UTI treatment is not considered complete by the time of surgery, antimicrobial agents targeting the causative isolate should be continued intraoperatively and postoperatively. If the UTI and bacteriuria are appropriately treated preoperatively, the usual prophylactic antimicrobial regimen described in this guideline should be followed. On the other hand, there is a lack of high\u2010quality evidence regarding the duration of antimicrobial administration in cases with asymptomatic bacteriuria, but there is also little evidence that prolonged postoperative antimicrobial administration is useful for the prevention of perioperative infection for these cases [", "type": "Document"}

Clean surgery is surgery that does not involve a breach of aseptic procedures and does not involve invasion of the digestive tract, reproductive organs, or the urinary tract without infection [ The incidence of SSI tends to be lower in minimally invasive surgery than in clean\u2010contaminated or contaminated surgeries. Explanation: Laparoscopic surgery in the urological field has spread rapidly in recent years and is surpassing open surgery. Furthermore, since RARP was covered by insurance in 2012, laparoscopic surgery, including robot\u2010assisted surgery, has become increasingly popular. Here, minimally invasive surgery is defined as the combination of laparoscopic surgery and robot\u2010assisted surgery. Minimally invasive surgery is generally less invasive than open surgery, and the wounds are smaller. Although minimally invasive surgery is expected to result in fewer perioperative infections, there have been few randomized comparisons between open and minimally invasive surgery in the field of urology. In a prospective multicenter study of perioperative infections in urology, Togo et al. [ In a single\u2010center retrospective comparison of RARP and open prostatectomy, the incidence of SSI was 0.6% and 4.5% for first\u2010generation cephalosporins administered within 24 h as prophylactic antimicrobial agents, with a significantly lower incidence of SSI in RARP [ A multicenter report the incidence of SSI ranged from 4.67% to 14% in open surgery, and from 2.95% to 3% for minimally invasive surgery [", "type": "Document"}

Explanation: For upper abdominal clean surgery (adrenalectomy, nephrectomy, partial nephrectomy) or surgery in the inguinal or scrotum without open urinary tract, the main bacteria targeted are gram\u2010positive cocci such as Staphylococcus aureus , and a single dose of a first\u2010generation cephalosporin or penicillin with BLI is recommended (Table Although partial nephrectomy, nephroureterectomy, and partial cystectomy were conventionally considered to be classified as clean\u2010contaminated surgery because the urinary tract is opened, the incidence of SSI is equivalent to that of clean surgery, and the same prophylaxis as clean surgery is sufficient in the absence of UTI (Table The incidence of SSI in clean surgery was reported to be 1.6% in urologic laparoscopic small incision (minimal wound endoscopy) surgery without prophylactic antimicrobial agents [ In clean surgery, the majority of studies were conducted with a single dose of a first\u2010generation cephalosporin. The majority of studies were conducted in minimally invasive surgery, and the incidence of SSI is low, so a single dose is recommended. As mentioned earlier, there is no difference in the incidence of SSIs in clean surgery between open and minimally invasive surgery, and a single dose is appropriate even in open surgery, despite the paucity of reports. In addition, there have been very few studies of minimally invasive surgery without prophylactic antimicrobial agents, and although we cannot recommend it at this time, we believe that non\u2010administration may become an option in the future as the evidence builds up.

The use of two antimicrobial agents for perioperative prophylaxis is complicated.According to the current Japanese data, the susceptibility of CMZ to Bacteroides and Prevotella, which are problematic anaerobic bacteria, is relatively good (60% for the former and 90% for the latter) [MNZ should be reserved as a treatment for severe intra\u2010abdominal and anaerobic infections, and its use as a perioperative prophylactic antimicrobial agent is likely to promote resistance to anaerobic bacteria. However, the rampant use of CMZ alone during contaminated surgery may accelerate the emergence of CMZ\u2010resistant bacteria.

Explanation: According to previous reports, the incidence of postoperative infection after TUL surgery ranges from 4% to 11.5% [p = 0.001), although the difference was not statistically significant (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.12\u20130.60, p = 0.001) and a trend toward a lower incidence of febrile UTI (fUTI) was found, although there was no statistically significant difference [ In an RCT comparing no ciprofloxacin, one dose (30 min before surgery), and two doses (first dose 30 min before surgery, additional dose within 6 h after surgery), the incidence of SIRS was statistically similar in the no\u2010dose group compared with the two\u2010dose group (9.9%, 4.9% in the one\u2010dose group, p = 0.112; 4.2% in the two\u2010dose group, p = 0.062).

In addition, the patient groups presenting with incisional and ventral hernias are becoming more complex as the treatment options, including the varieties of mesh, continue to grow. This increasing complexity as well as the variability of outcomes leads us to challenge the traditional application of EBM, which to date has not included knowledge generated from clinical quality-improvement studies. This is not to say that this understanding of EBM does not have value for complex problems, such as abdominal wall hernia disease. However, it is incomplete and represents a starting point rather than a goal toward understanding how to improve the value of care for both the patient who presents with a ventral/incisional hernia and the system in which that care is provided. This chapter describes the current evidence for the variability of ventral/incisional hernia patients and presents a brief framework for understanding how to apply new thinking to the study of complex problems such as ventral/incisional hernia disease. During the past 150 years, traditional clinical research methods have been based on reductionist scientific approaches, in which the scientific method is applied to the study of one part or variable (e.g., a drug or device) within a complex system (e.g., a patient\u2019s cycle of care). This approach to medical research has led to significant improvements in health care. Without the ability to perform prospective, RCTs, many improvements in health care would not have been achieved. However, a closer look at advances in health care shows that many significant innovations did not come from well-planned studies based on the traditional application of the scientific method. They often were discovered by accident or by innovators outside the traditional scientific community [1, 2]. Many treatments approved through rigorous scientific scrutiny have later been proven to cause unexpected and unintended harm or have been found to offer unexpected benefits for other unrelated diseases [3, 4]. Even major medical initiatives, such as the human genome project, have emerged through loose collaborations and relationships between various individuals and often between various types of experts [5]. More recently, many health care research initiatives are being initiated by patients and family members who have been frustrated by the lack of medical knowledge generated by our traditional research mechanisms (e.g., the women who started studies on spontaneous coronary artery dissection because none were available, and the two mothers from Old Lyme, CT, who initiated the studies elucidating the cause of Lyme disease) [6, 7]. A new field of medicine is forming, referred to as complex adaptive systems research [8]. Complex adaptive systems describe any biologic organism (e.g., the human body) and any grouping of biologic organisms (e.g., our health care system). Research conducted to generate evidence based on the study of complex adaptive systems includes clinical quality improvement methods, participatory research (sometimes led by patients and family members), and documentation of data throughout the entire cycle of patient care including psychosocial and other nontraditional outcomes measures. This field recognizes that humans likely belong to many subgroups that must be identified for better prediction of outcomes and improvement of value. These subgroups may be based on genetics, environment, disease states, age, sex, and the like. Many researchers are realizing that the traditional application of reductionist research methods often is inadequate in the search to improve the value of patient care [9]. One reason these traditional research methods are inadequate is that as our medical knowledge increases exponentially, an almost infinite number variables appear, with an almost infinite number of complex relationships between them. These relational interactions can have an impact on the outputs, leading to an escalating degree of complexity in health care and our world in general [10]. In addition, these variables and relationships are constantly changing and are not controllable. In light of this increasing complexity, traditional research methods alone are not sufficient to improve the value of care for the patient or the value of the overall health care system [11].", "type": "Document"}

Variability that can have an impact on outcomes for ventral/incisional hernia repair may include patient factors, technique variability, surgeon skill, and variability in mesh characteristics, as well as variability in both the environmental conditions of the patient\u2019s home living conditions and the facility in which treatment occurs. Studies on the variability of ventral/incisional hernias are few, but a comparison of studies analyzing different types of ventral/incisional hernias clearly shows a large variety of outcomes based on many complex factors. One study within the U.S. Veterans Affairs (VA) system showed significant variation in the use of mesh for ventral/incisional hernia repair, which correlated with less recurrence at the facilities in which mesh was used more often (up to a fourfold increase in mesh use) [12]. A study using similar VA data showed that the location of mesh placement also had an impact on outcomes, with laparoscopic and underlay mesh placement leading to lower recurrence rates than onlay and inlay mesh placement [13]. One prospective clinical study attempted to define some of the complex variables involved in laparoscopic ventral/incisional hernia repair. In that study, Jenkins et al. [14] documented significant variation for a number of variables from a group of 180 patients, with data collected prospectively. Significant variation was documented for patient age, body mass index (BMI), number of previous open abdominal procedures (range 0\u201313), previous laparoscopic procedures (range 0\u20136), number of prior hernia repairs (range 0\u20138), and many other patient factors. Significant variation also was documented for the actual operative procedure, with wide variation in the time required for adhesiolysis, mesh placement, and overall operative time. The variables that increased the time required for adhesiolysis included the history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the presence of bowel adhesions, and a suprapubic hernia location. A suprapubic hernia location and incarceration of hernia contents significantly increased the time for mesh placement and the total operative time. The presence of bowel adhesions also significantly increased the total operative time. Another study investigating laparoscopic ventral/incisional hernia repair for hernias in a suprapubic location resulted in increased complication and recurrence rates compared with a large study of laparoscopic ventral/incisional hernia repair that included all locations [15, 16]. Other location variability such as flank, subcostal, parastomal variations and the like also would be expected to have an impact on surgical outcomes, especially if the surgeon has had little experience performing ventral/incisional hernia repair for hernias in these atypical locations. BMI also can be a variable with an impact on the outcomes of laparoscopic ventral/incisional hernia repair. In one study of more than 1,000 patients by Tsereteli et al. [17], morbidly obese patients had a fourfold increase in recurrence compared with non-morbidly obese patients. In addition to obesity, another patient factor that can have a significant impact on outcomes is the size of the defect and the amount or volume of the herniated contents. Outcomes such as operative time, complications, and recurrence rates for laparoscopic ventral/incisional hernia repair of small defects differ greatly from those for loss-of-domain hernias [18, 19]. A variety of factors also can be seen as having an impact on the postoperative course of patients undergoing ventral/incisional hernia repair. Studies evaluating factors related to the need for mesh removal showed that postoperative complications, recurrence rates, surgical-site infection (SSI), resource use, patient demographics (e.g., male sex, history of smoking), hernia characteristics (e.g., size of defect, incarceration), and technique factors (e.g., laparoscopic, open) all had the potential to contribute to outcome differences [20\u201324]. Another complex variable that can have a potential impact on outcomes of ventral/incisional hernia repair is the choice of mesh material. Although most synthetic meshes used currently produce good short-term results, any mesh could contribute to complications in a given subgroup of patients. A partial list of mesh-related complications includes infection requiring mesh removal, mesh mechanical failure, mesh bulging, chronic pain, chronic inflammatory reaction, and mesh erosion into abdominal viscera [25, 26]. With the number and variety of hernia meshes available for ventral/incisional hernia repair, this variable alone is sufficient to demonstrate that traditional research mechanisms (i.e., prospective RCTs) are inadequate to determine the mesh or meshes that have the best value for various patient groups, hernia types, techniques, surgeon skill levels, and so forth. With an understanding of complexity science, complex systems, continuous learning, and continuous clinical quality improvement, we can begin to understand and improve value for patients who present with a ventral/incisional hernia. The starting point for this endeavor is the best current available evidence, much of which is contained in the remaining chapters of this document.", "type": "Document"}

Specifically, the increasing variability in ventral/incisional hernia patients and technique options minimizes the value of applying traditional research methods to improve outcomes. We need to change our thinking and learn how to understand and implement research methods designed to address this increasing complexity so we can fully address health care challenges such as ventral/incisional hernia disease. This includes not only an evolution of traditional/current EBM but also an evolution of evidenced-based management in health care. Because complex systems research is most often applied in the real world of patient care in the community, hospital, clinic, and even the academic medical center, we need to apply the principles of continuous learning and continuous clinical quality improvement to our regular patient care in addition to using traditional clinical research methods. As we apply these new principles (new to health care, although currently used in other industries) and learn how to use complexity science\u2013driven data analytics, the patient clusters that emerge will guide our treatment options and lead to improved value for our entire system.

However, CT or MRI can be recommended in some cases for a more precise preoperative diagnosis. The available literature is most concerned with investigations involving specific entities [27\u201339]. Data on the use of CT and MRI are lacking for all ventral hernia types. In cases with abdominal trauma, a CT scan is recommended, among other things, to identify potential traumatic ventral hernias. Killeen et al. [27] investigated the CT scan results for patients with blunt abdominal trauma and traumatic lumbar hernias, which showed that 9 of 14 patients had concomitant injuries and that only 1 of the 14 patients had clinical signs of a hernia. Likewise, in a retrospective series of 15 traumatic abdominal wall hernias, all correctly diagnosed by a CT scan and subsequently confirmed intraoperatively, Hickey et al. [29] reported on the high frequency of associated mesenteric and intestinal injuries. The CT scan can therefore provide valuable information concerning concomitant injuries, hernia condition, or potential hematoma. The importance of the CT scan for diagnosing uncommon abdominal wall hernias has been demonstrated by some case reports and retrospective series [31, 33\u201339]. Gough and Vella [35] described the discovery of an incarcerated Spieghelian hernia as the cause of an acute abdominal pain by a CT scan. Skrekas et al. [31] highlighted the case of a patient who had swelling in the left lumbar region without trauma or previous surgery. The CT scan showed a superior lumbar hernia (Grynfeltt hernia). For obese patients, a CT scan also can be helpful. Rose et al. [30] reported on three obese patients for whom clinical examination failed to detect a hernia. The CT scan showed a ventral hernia as the cause of the complaint. Currently, no reported studies have described the preoperative use of MRI in the diagnosis of ventral hernias. The current view is against performing a CT scan for all ventral hernias. Instead, CT is recommended for cases of obesity, repeated previous operations, large hernias with possible loss of domain, and traumatic hernias, and for the diagnosis of uncommon ventral hernias. Currently, a number of studies [40\u201347] describe the use of CT scans after laparoscopic ventral hernia repair (LVHR). Gutierrez de la Pena et al. [40] reported on 50 patients with LVHR who underwent clinical investigations 1 year after surgery, including a CT scan and diagnostic laparoscopy. Recurrences were correctly diagnosed in 98 % of the cases by CT and in 88 % of the cases by clinical investigation. Wagenblast et al. [41], in a prospective study of 35 patients with LVHR, reported four patients with subsequent swelling for whom CT scan was able to differentiate between a seroma and a recurrence. Currently, reports of MRI describe only the diagnosis of adhesions after LVHR by cine MRI [40\u201350]. The CT scan is the method of choice for the postoperative differential diagnosis of recurrences, seroma, and bulging or residual hernias. An ultrasound investigation can be helpful in detecting seromas but does not yield the necessary anatomic details as does the CT scan to enable a firm diagnosis of recurrence [47].", "type": "Document"}

The EHS classification generally is regarded as an improvement on the previous classifications.", "type": "Document"}

The scarcity of evidence is illustrated in Fig. In morphologic terms, the EHS classification defines median and lateral hernias. Morphology may influence the type of procedure, for example, in the subxiphoidal area [54, 55, 57, 66] or in the suprapubic region [15, 57]. In a nonrandomized clinical trial involving 199 patients, lateral incisional hernias had a different clinical presentation than medial hernias, with more preoperative pain and more postoperative complications [69]. The location of the hernia is of importance for the surgical strategy. Proximity to bony structures, tension in closing the gap, and the composition of the fascia layers need to be considered [14, 57, 65]. The location of the hernia correlates with the operative time [14]. In the future, comparison of data regarding surgical approach, layer of mesh insertion, quality of life, and morphology will be included in comparative studies [71, 72]. The EHS classification requires measurement of the gap size during the surgical procedure. There is a consensus that the length of the hernia gap should be the greatest longitudinal distance between the proximal and distal margins of the hernia gaps, as it also should be for the width in the transversal axis [70, 71]. Hernia width is a useful intraoperative variable in tailoring surgical procedures [15, 57, 72, 73]. Findings have shown the width of the hernia gap to be a predictive factor for postoperative complications and the length of the hernia to be an independent prognostic factor for repeat recurrences [57]. Hernia gap size also can influence the time needed for the surgical procedure and serves as a marker of operative complexity [14, 64]. Related to the hernia gap is the reducibility of the sac contents. Nonreducible incisional hernias have been shown to correlate significantly with a seroma [21, 60]. Risk factors were studied in large cohort series [59, 76] and potential risk groups [73]. Smoking, male gender, BMI, age, SSI, and postoperative wound complications are risk factors for the development of an incisional hernia [14, 57, 67, 72\u201375]. According to experimental evidence, patients with incisional hernias have an imbalance in the collagen metabolism [62]. Risk factors have been shown to influence the incidence of repeat recurrences [57]. Because risk factors and comorbidities are not understood to date, the working group of the European Registry of Abdominal Wall Hernias (EuraHS at www.eurahs.eu) introduced the definition of the severity of comorbidity (SOC) score to refine further the influence of risk factors on the course of ventral and incisional hernias [71]. Risk factors should be considered in tailoring the surgical procedure and in counseling the patient regarding the expected postoperative course and prognosis of recurrence during late follow-up evaluation (Table", "type": "Document"}

The term \u201csmall hernia\u201d often is used, although it has never been precisely defined. The consensus is that it involves a defect 2 cm in size or smaller.

K\u00f6ckerling, P. Chowbey > Recommendations\nObesity is a risk factor for occurrence of incisional hernias and leads to higher perioperative complication and recurrence rates after open repair. There are multifactorial reasons for this, such as delayed wound healing, impaired pulmonary function, and higher intraabdominal pressure [163]. Metaanalyses of prospective randomized studies comparing laparoscopic repair of incisional and ventral hernias with open repair have shown a significantly lower rate of wound infections, with no removal of the mesh, for the laparoscopic IPOM technique (level 1A) and a trend toward lower infection rates with mesh removal (level 1A) using the laparoscopic technique [113]. In the metaanalysis of Sauerland et al. [106], the local infection rate in the laparoscopic group was 3.1 versus 13.4 % in the open group (p < 0.00001). A local infection requiring mesh removal was found in 0.7 % of the laparoscopic group and 3.5 % of the open group (p = 0.09). In an analysis of pooled data on 4,582 laparoscopic and 758 open repairs of incisional and ventral hernias, Pierce et al. [169] found a wound complication rate of 3.8 % for the laparoscopic procedure and 16.8 % for the open technique (p < 0.0001) (level 2A). The significantly lower rate of wound complications attests to the benefits of using the laparoscopic technique, especially for obese persons, who are at higher risk for wound complications. In a metaanalysis of cohort studies, Mavros et al. [170] observed a trend toward higher mesh infection rates for obese patients after open ventral hernia repair. However, a larger abdominal wall defect must be expected in obese patients with an incisional hernia. A study by Moreno-Egea et al. [96] demonstrated that in patients with a BMI higher than 30 kg/m2, the proportion of defects larger than 10 cm was 35.1 %. However, 60 % of the patients with a defect size of 10\u201312 cm had a BMI higher than 30 kg/m2, and the proportion of patients with defects larger 12 cm rose to 73.5 % (level 2B). Accordingly, a larger defect for an incisional hernia must always be expected in obese persons. During a mean follow-up period of 5 years after laparoscopic IPOM repair of incisional hernias, the study by Moreno-Egea et al. saw recurrences in 0.4 % of the patients who had defects smaller than 10 cm, in 20 % of those with defects 10\u201312 cm in size, and in 41.2 % of those with defects larger than 12 cm. Accordingly, significant differences were noted in the defect sizes, the BMI, and the proportion of patients with a BMI higher than 30 kg/m2 between the recurrence and the nonrecurrence groups. In the former group, the mean BMI was 36.3 \u00b1 6.3 versus 29.5 \u00b1 5.9 kg/m2 in the nonrecurrence group (p < 0.001). The proportion of patients with a BMI higher than 30 kg/m2 was 90 % in the recurrence group and 37.9 % in the nonrecurrence group (p < 0.001). The mean defect size was 14.4 \u00b1 2.9 cm in the recurrence group and 7.9 \u00b1 2.9 cm in the nonrecurrence group (p < 0.001). Thus, patients with a BMI higher than 30 kg/m2 have significantly larger defects and higher recurrence rates, especially patients with a defects larger than 8\u201310 cm. Accordingly, additional technical steps are needed to prevent recurrence in these patients, such as the use of a larger mesh to ensure more extensive mesh overlap and stronger fixation of the mesh or even suture closure of the defect. A comparison of early postoperative outcomes between patients with a BMI lower than 35 kg/m2 and those with a BMI of 35 kg/m2 or higher (level 3) showed no significant differences in the rate for enterotomies, hematomas, seromas, enterocutaneous fistulas, or postoperative infections [171]. For 163 patients with a BMI higher than 30 kg/m2, Novitsky et al. [172] reported a mortality rate of 0 % after laparoscopic repair of incisional and ventral hernias, a conversion rate of 3.1 %, a postoperative complication rate of 12.3 %, a wound infection rate of 1.2 %, and a mesh-related infection rate of 1.2 %. Raftopoulos and Courcoulas [43] reported no mortality in their patients with a BMI of 35 kg/m2 or higher, but the wound infection rate was 3.7 %, the bladder injury rate was 3.7 %, and the postoperative ileus rate was 11.1 %.", "type": "Document"}

Schrittwieser > Recommendation\nReoperations for recurrence of ventral hernia are challenging. Currently no evidence-based recommendations of optimal management exist. In cases of recurrence after previous open suture repair, the decision concerning the approach (open or laparoscopic surgery) is similar to that for the primary incisional hernia [106, 168, 173]. After open mesh repair, reoperation by the laparoscopic approach has certain advantages. First, the repeat operation is performed at a different site/level of the abdominal wall. Second, in all instances, the entire incisional scar can be covered by a mesh. Usually, it is not necessary to remove the previously inserted mesh, hence avoiding an extensive dissection of the abdominal wall. Uranues et al. [174] demonstrated that with sufficient expertise, laparoscopic reoperation can be performed with moderate recurrence rates, even after multiple previous repairs. A possible advantage of laparoscopic reoperation is the identification of previously undiscovered recurrent hernias, which can be undertaken during the same intervention. Sharma et al. [42] reported 203 occult hernias (16.3 %) in their series of 1,242 laparoscopic ventral hernia repairs during a period of 13 years.", "type": "Document"}

However, there is significantly more literature on antibiotic prophylaxis for inguinal hernia surgery than for ventral hernia. The rate of infection with LVHR in specific studies can be as high as 16 %, but it usually is much lower, ranging from 0.5 to 4 % [182]. Two level 2b studies are available. R\u00edos et al.

The wound infection rate was 1 of 17 in the antibiotic prophylaxis group compared with 8 of 18 in the nonantibiotic prophylaxis group. Three level four studies are available. White et al. [179] reported on 250 hernia operations in 206 patients over a period of 14 years. Neither antibiotics nor drainage had any influence on the rate of wound complications. Deysine [180] in a retrospective study of more than 4,000 inguinal and 350 clean ventral hernia operations reported an infection rate of 0.11 %. The antibiotic prophylaxis involved 1 g of cefazolin given intravenously 1 h before the operation, and the protocol included additional frequent intraoperative wound flushing with a solution comprising 80 mg of gentamicin in 250 ml of NaCl. A further retrospective study by Edwards et al. [178] reported on 65 cases of laparoscopic ventral hernia repair designed to establish the rate of seroma-associated cellulitis. Before surgery, all the patients had received a third-generation cephalosporin, and in addition, 45 of the 65 patients received either cephalosporin or fluoroquinolone orally during 7 days after the operation. The rate of seromas was equal in the two groups, but all the patients who received only antibiotics preoperatively experienced cellulitis, whereas in the pre- and postoperative group, the rate was only 40 %. However, the study dealt with a small and a very heterogeneous sample of patients. Some studies advocate the routine use of prophylactic antibiotics ranging from administration of amoxicillin (1 g) and clavulanic acid (200 mg) before surgery and then 8 h after the operation [181] to administration of a second-generation cephalosporin at the start of the anesthesia and then 24 h after the operation [183] to administration of a first-generation cephalosporin at the time of the skin incision and then again for operations lasting longer than 2 h [16]. From the available studies, a clear recommendation for or against the use of antibiotic prophylaxis cannot be drawn. It appears advisable, however, to consider administering a prophylactic antibiotic for patients with risk factors (advanced age, administration of corticosteroids, immunosuppressive therapy, obesity, diabetes, or malignant tumor) and for cases with surgical risk factors (contamination, long operation duration, drainage, urinary catheter).", "type": "Document"}

Rohr, Y. Trommer > Recommendations\nMany articles report on the placements of the trocars [188], which should be placed in dependence on the suspected presence of adhesions and the size, the site, and number of wall defects [187, 189]. A three-trocar technique is mostly preferred, with placement of a 10- or 12-mm trocar first and then, depending on the intraabdominal anatomic situation, placement of one or two additional 5- or 10-mm trocars [190]. These also can be positioned along the subcostal line on the left side crossing the rectus muscle or on the right side [191]. It frequently is necessary to place and manipulate instruments from the side of the patient directly opposite the viewing laparoscope to produce a mirror image that enables better viewing of all the adhesions [187]. Moreover, an opposite 5-mm trocar may provide better fixation for the parts of the mesh near the optic trocar [192]. In a few cases, despite the left subcostal area, a subumbilical insertion may be chosen, but no firm recommendations exist for this decision. The use of a 30\u00b0 scope is necessary to provide a good view of the inner aspect of the abdominal wall [187]. In contrast to groin hernia operations, for most patients, the capnopneumoperitoneum is not created using a Veress needle [193, 194]. The left subcostal position is used to insert the first trocar (mostly 10\u201312 mm) using the open technique (Hasson) and to insufflate CO2 to a pressure of 12\u201314 mmHg [195, 196]. When the mesh is later inserted into the abdomen, the pneumoperitoneum is reduced to 9 mmHg until the mesh is fixed by suture, and then after application of the tacks, the pressure is restored again to 12\u201314 mmHg [197].", "type": "Document"}

The first trocar should always be placed as far as possible laterally from the defect to provide clear visualization of the defect margin. In dealing with midline and right-sided abdominal wall defects, three inline trocars in the left abdomen are ideal. Left-sided abdominal defects are approached via three trocars on the right [199, 200]. Small subxiphoid defects can be managed with the patient in a modified lithotomic position and with the surgeon between the patient\u2019s legs. The camera port is placed at the umbilicus, and a 5-mm trocar on each side provides excellent triangulation around the hernia. For larger subxiphoid defects, the umbilical port is not used. Instead, three trocars are used in the left flank, with the inferiormost port closer to the midline [199, 201]. Suprapubic defects can be managed in a similar fashion. For smaller defects, the umbilicus can be used as the camera port with two small working ports on either side. Larger suprapubic hernias also can be repaired using three left-flank trocars, with the uppermost port closer to the midline [199, 202]. Additional ports should always be placed as needed. This certainly will be of benefit for difficult cases in which extensive adhesiolysis is required or a large hernia sac is encountered.", "type": "Document"}

Lang > Recommendations\nAlthough up to 25 % of the individuals have adhesions without previous operations [203, 204], adhesions form after nearly every invasive abdominal procedure [205]. Adhesions are a major health problem [206\u2013215]. In a hernia operation, adhesiolysis is a basic part of the procedure because nearly all hernias exhibit adhesions to the abdominal wall. An important issue is to decide how much adhesiolysis is needed. For hernia operations, use of a mesh adhesiolysis is needed to free the abdominal wall around the overlapping zone of the mesh. In the FINHYST trial, adhesiolysis was the strongest single risk factor for major complications as a whole [odds ratio (OR), 2.41; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.38\u20134.21] [204]. Most important, an increased extent of adhesiolysis may lead to an increased frequency of enterotomies with life-threatening sequelae [175, 212, 216]. On the other hand, surgical adhesiolysis offers no additional benefit (e.g., less chronic abdominal pain) [217]. Evidence points in the direction of a strategy that favors sufficient adhesiolysis to enable optimal overlapping of the defect by the mesh on all sides. Adhesiolysis should be performed away from the adherent tissue and near the abdominal wall [193]. Adhesiolysis can be performed using several methods, and reformation of adhesions is unaffected by the method of adhesiolysis used [218]. According to existing level 4 evidence, ultrasonic dissection is safe for adhesiolysis [219], and a level 2c study showed fewer gallbladder perforations during laparoscopic cholecystectomy when the harmonic scalpel was used instead of monopolar cautery) [220]. Additionally, the harmonic scalpel has a smaller collateral damage zone and reaches lower temperatures than monopolar cautery [221]. The search showed no study directly comparing different methods of adhesiolysis and their risks, although an Italian consensus conference recommended cold and sharp adhesiolysis [193]. In an animal model, ultrasonic coagulating shears, electrothermal bipolar vessel sealer, titanium laparoscopic clips, and plastic laparoscopic clips all show sufficient hemostasis [222]. Therefore, to avoid enterotomy, it is safer to use cold and sharp adhesiolysis or ultrasonic dissection.", "type": "Document"}

Chowbey > Recommendations\nIn open surgery, the size of the defect may play a minor role [223], whereas in laparoscopic repair, its accurate measurement seems to be essential for estimating the proper size of the mesh to be used [96, 224]. Laparoscopic procedure is performed for patients with larger defects (i.e., > 15 cm) [158], but this will not work without sufficient overlapping. The more overlapping the surgeon achieves, the lower the recurrence rate will be [225]. Precise measurement of defect size and the correspondingly choice of an appropriate mesh size are indispensable preconditions for the success of the repair. To determine the size of the hernia defect, a transverse and vertical dimension of 6 to 10 cm is added, and a prosthesis slightly larger than these measurements is used to ensure at least a 3- to 5-cm overlap [226]. Currently, no standard and accurate method exists for measuring the size of the hernia defect. Most commonly, measurement of the hernia defect size is estimated by physical examination, which lacks accuracy [42]. Other methods include extracorporeal palpation of the hernia defect, with it marked in the distended abdominal cavity and then measured after deflation [226]. Intracorporeal measurement is possible by placing spinal needles through the abdominal wall or by placing an intraperitoneal ruler after adhesiolysis. In addition, the size of the hernia can be reported as the largest diameter of the hernia defect when measured directly intraperitoneally by a laparoscope [42, 226]. Intracorporeal methods are more accurate and advantageous than extracorporeal methods. The laparoscopic approach defines the margins of the hernia defect clearly and helps in identifying additional defects that may not have been apparent preoperatively. In addition, it prevents distortion of abdominal wall contour and the hernia sac [42, 226, 227].", "type": "Document"}

A total of 27 articles were relevant but were of a low evidence level (levels 3, 4, and 5). Laparoscopic repair of ventral and incisional hernias was introduced by Karl LeBlanc [228] in 1993. The IPOM procedure consists of reducing the hernia content and patching the abdominal wall defect with an overlapping nonabsorbable synthetic mesh, which is tacked to the abdominal wall. In LeBlanc\u2019s original technique, the tacks were metallic. The experience with the first 100 patients led to reinforcement of the tacked mesh with several additional transfascial mesh-fixing sutures, decreasing the recurrence rate from 9 to 4 % in the next 100 patients [152]. Such a \u201cbridging repair\u201d may lead in larger hernias to a functional problem. The major goal of any open abdominal wall repair is not only reduction of hernia content and prevention of further herniation but also restoration of the integrity and restitution of abdominal wall functionality, especially restoration of the linea alba. Mimicking open repair, laparoscopic operation should combine the transfascial transabdominal closure of the defect with the IPOM placement. Such procedure is called \u201caugmentation repair\u201d (or IPOM-Plus) in contrast to \u201cbridging repair\u201d (the classical IPOM). The laparoscopically assisted transfascial suturing is achieved either transabdominally with multiple interrupted sutures [229, 235, 237] or intraabdominally with a running suture [232]. The bridged area in IPOM is formed by mesh only (with no musculo-aponeurotic coverage) and as such is functionally adynamic. This creates the well-known phenomenon of bulging and leaves space for seroma formation. The sutured repair in IPOM-Plus may reduce the hernia size to zero, eliminating bulging, and decreasing the seroma size and incidence, hence keeping the potential infection risk low. Although the straight defect closure is not feasible for every hernia due to unacceptable tension, a combination with the endoscopic components separation technique may lower the tension and enable the closure. Hybrid techniques (combination of different approaches) can combine minilaparatomy for hernia closure and a following laparoscopic IPOM reinforcement with or without components separation.", "type": "Document"}

[234] presented his \u201csuturing concept for laparoscopic mesh fixation in ventral and incisional hernias.\u201d An essential component of his technique is closure of the defect with the U reverse stitches. The same author [235, 237] reported improved outcomes with growing experience (733 patients), longer follow-up periods, and experience with 85 redo surgeries [237]. Palanivelu et al. [232] retrospectively analyzed 721 patients with laparoscopic incisional hernia repair. During a mean follow-up period of 4.2 years, only four recurrences (0.55 %) were noted. The repair consisted of defect closure with running suture of polyamide and reinforcement using intraabdominal Parietex composite mesh or Dualmesh. In 2004, Franklin et al. [143] published a retrospective analysis of 384 patients with laparoscopic abdominal wall hernia repair. During a mean follow-up period of 47.1 months, 11 recurrences (2.9 %) were found. Their repair involved closure of large defects with nonabsorbable interrupted sutures, even if only a limited closure was possible, and reinforcement with nonabsorbable mesh. Banerjee et al. [231] reported on a retrospective comparative study of 193 patients. His IPOM-Plus of interrupted nonabsorbable sutures and intraperitoneal mesh reinforcement achieved better recurrence rates than IPOM used to manage primary and recurrent abdominal wall hernias (3 vs 4.8 and 4.8 vs 10.5 %, respectively). Agarwal et al. [230] described a defect-suturing technique using spinal needles as threader and snare needles. He introduced the mesh through a 10-mm port placed through the hernia defect, which was consecutively covered by the prosthetic mesh. Sharma et al. [244] proposed interrupted nonabsorbable sutures with far-near-near-far stitching. This results in a double-layered suture repair augmented with intraperitoneal mesh. In 2011, Orenstein et al. [241] described the shoe-lacing technique for physiologic abdominal wall reconstruction. \u201cFigure eight stitches\u201d with nonabsorbable sutures close the defect. Nonabsorbable cardinal sutures and additional absorbable transfascial sutures around the defect support the circumferential fixation of the mesh margins with metallic or absorbable tacks. A systematic review of the outcomes for correction of diastasis of the recti by Hickey et al. [242] demonstrated that the resuturing without adequate support of mesh and sufficient fixation leads to unsatisfactory results.

In fact, LeBlanc [182] in 2004 established that the main reason for recurrence after LVHR was related to cases in which transfascial sutures were not used. Studies with an evidence level 3a [182, 255] showed that a larger overlap of the defect by the prosthesis (5 vs 3 cm) was necessary if sutures were not used. Findings have shown that technical reasons, together with a small overlap of the defect in all directions, are among the key factors related to recurrences and are more important than the method of fixation. Tsimoyiannis et al. [225] studied 78 patients who underwent 80 LVHR procedures with expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) dual mesh placed intraperitoneally and fixed by full-thickness sutures and endoscopic tacks. They concluded that the combination of a large patch to overlap the defect by at least 4 cm and the surgeon\u2019s experience were important in the prevention of recurrences. However, it is difficult to draw reliable conclusions based on 14 studies with an evidence level of 4, especially because three of the studies were based on fewer than ten cases [256, 261, 266]. Summarizing the literature, the mesh should overlap the hernia defect at least 3\u20135 cm in all directions, and the extent of this overlap should be larger as the defect gets larger. However, whereas the evidence for the first recommendation is strong, the evidence for the second recommendation is weak. The need for a large overlap is related to three factors: intraabdominal pressure because this will tend to fold the mesh better against the abdominal if its surface is sufficiently large; a large mesh because it will have more surface to interact with the abdominal wall, increasing the ingrowth and hence the biologic fixation; and a large mesh to compensate for any shrinkage of the mesh. Another important issue relates to the need for covering the entire previous scar to avoid a weak area in the abdominal wall through which a new hernia or a recurrence can occur [44].", "type": "Document"}

[159] reported very low recurrence rates of 1.4 and 4.4 %, respectively, with this technique. The discussion concerning the increased recurrence risk due to fewer fixation devices (e.g., transfascial sutures) still is going on [326].

Due to the variability of patient characteristics and the nonstandardized technique of using different fixations and mesh types, these results are likely to contain bias and need confirmation by RCTs (currently lacking).", "type": "Document"}

All other studies have described the need for a complete dissection of the retropubic space for appropriate mesh positioning with good overlap of at least 4\u20135 cm. Most fixation techniques are based on a combination of sutures and tacks. A new technique described by Palanivelu et al. [332] involves complete closure of the hernia defect by running sutures and mesh fixation (overlap of 5 cm) using pre-tied intracorporal sutures with 4- to 5-cm intervals circumferentially. Postoperative pain was reported by Carbonell et al. [202], Palanivelu et al. [332], Varnell et al. [15], and Sharma et al.

Given the potential for multisystem involvement, timing of surgery needs to be carefully considered to plan for safe surgery. This consensus statement uses evidence from a systematic review and expert opinion to highlight key principles in the timing of surgery. Shared decision\u2010making regarding timing of surgery after SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection must account for severity of the initial infection; ongoing symptoms of COVID\u201019; comorbid and functional status; clinical priority and risk of disease progression; and complexity of surgery. For the protection of staff, other patients and the public, planned surgery should not be considered during the period that a patient may be infectious. Precautions should be undertaken to prevent pre\u2010 and peri\u2010operative infection, especially in higher risk patients. Elective surgery should not be scheduled within 7 weeks of a diagnosis of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection unless the risks of deferring surgery outweigh the risk of postoperative morbidity or mortality associated with COVID\u201019. SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 causes either transient or asymptomatic disease for most patients, who require no additional precautions beyond a 7\u2010week delay, but those who have persistent symptoms or have been hospitalised require special attention. Patients with persistent symptoms of COVID\u201019 are at increased risk of postoperative morbidity and mortality even after 7 weeks. The time before surgery should be used for functional assessment, prehabilitation and multidisciplinary optimisation. Vaccination several weeks before surgery will reduce risk to patients and might lessen the risk of nosocomial SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection of other patients and staff.

Advances in surgical technique and perioperative care have improved outcomes. Liver resections are still characterized however by a complex interplay of patient-, malignancy-, and liver function-related factors, resulting in a high risk of complications. These include bile leaks, haemorrhage, venous thromboembolism (VTE), surgical-site infections (SSIs), and post-hepatectomy liver failure (PHLF) eventually leading to worsened short- and long-term outcomes. Despite growing clinical experience, evidence guiding peri- and postoperative management is frequently of moderate quality, largely derived from retrospective studies, institutional protocols, or expert opinion. Professional societies such as the ERAS\u00ae (Enhanced Recovery After Surgery) Society have published guidelines with the aim of optimizing perioperative patient management. Regarding prevention and management of post-hepatectomy complications, to date, no consensus recommendations guiding patient care are however available. Considering the persistent inconsistency in clinical practices, the overarching objective of this consensus project was to furnish clinical guidance on specific perioperative matters and the management of postoperative complications, categorized in six topics. Perioperative thromboprophylaxis, its timing and duration, and the management of occurring portal vein thrombosis (PVT) was addressed. In the context of liver resections, there is often a delicate balance to be considered between the risk of bleeding and the occurrence of thrombotic complications. This is further complicated by hypercoagulability during the perioperative period. In light of the safe, abbreviated perioperative regimens and reduced SSIs following tailored antibiotic administration, the second topic covered perioperative antibiotics, including recommendations on timing and length of antibiotic prophylaxis for standard liver resections and those for patients considered at high risk. Given the expansion of boundaries in liver resection, the importance of preoperative multimodal prehabilitation protocols is increasing. Themes pertaining to preoperative screening and perioperative nutritional optimization were selected for this consensus. Postoperative bile leakage is a prevalent complication, with incidence rates ranging from 5% to 15% and even higher following perihilar resections. The fourth topic included issues pertaining to leakage prevention, early detection, and treatment strategies. Then post-hepatectomy haemorrhage (PHH) was addressed. Rather than emphasizing the management of this life-threatening complication, which is undoubtedly influenced by patients\u2019 conditions, this consensus focused on various pre- and intraoperative strategies designed to avert this deleterious complication. Finally, this consensus focused on diagnosis, management, and monitoring of patients experiencing PHLF following the recently published Innsbruck consensus on preoperative liver function assessments. The objective of this European consensus project was to harmonize practices across these six domains. It should guide clinicians through evidence-informed recommendations for optimal peri- and postoperative care following liver resection.", "type": "Document"}

Pharmacological thromboprophylaxis is recommended for all patients undergoing liver surgery and can be initiated either pre- or postoperatively. Mechanical thromboprophylaxis (socks, pneumatic) should be considered routinely. Recommendation grade: conditional | median level of evidence: 2+ (range: 2++ to 3) Expert panel comment The incidence of post-hepatectomy VTE has been reported to range between 2% and 6%, which is higher than the incidence observed for many other abdominal surgeries and is directly proportional to the magnitude of the hepatectomy, with extended hepatectomies exhibiting the highest risk. Published hepatectomy bleeding event rates range from 1% to 8%, with most series focusing their data on intraoperative bleeding and transfusion rates. An American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) analysis reported that the gradient between VTE event rate and bleeding complications ranged from 3.5 to 8.3 times and increased significantly with the magnitude of hepatectomy. Pharmacological thromboprophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin should be initiated as a standard postoperative care measure, unless deemed contraindicated by exceptional circumstances. There is no high-quality evidence to guide the optimal timing of thromboprophylaxis in liver surgery specifically. In particular, evidence is lacking on whether it should be initiated preoperatively or postoperatively. Retrospective uncontrolled studies have provided low-quality evidence suggesting that preoperatively initiated pharmacological thromboprophylaxis using LMWH could decrease VTE events. However, regarding bleeding, the reports are conflicting. Therefore, the current clinical practice is highly variable between centres. While postoperatively initiated thromboprophylaxis is associated with lower VTE rates without an increase in bleeding complications, no strong recommendation can be made in the preoperative setting. An RCT (PREPOSTEROUS trial, NCT04731558) comparing preoperative to postoperative thromboprophylaxis in liver surgery is currently recruiting. Until high-quality evidence emerges, either approach is acceptable. Q2 What is the optimal duration of perioperative thromboprophylaxis in liver surgery? A 4-week period of administration of LMWH should be considered after major liver surgery. Prolonged (>4 weeks) prophylaxis may however be indicated in high-risk patients based on individual risk stratification. Recommendation grade: conditional | median level of evidence: 2\u2212 (range: 2\u2212 to 4) Expert panel comment High-level evidence for perioperative thromboprophylaxis specifically in liver surgery, adjusted to patient\u2019s factors, extent of surgery, and open versus minimally invasive approach is lacking. The term \u2018prolonged\u2019 prophylaxis is used variably in the literature, referring to 4 weeks or more than 4 weeks, depending on the study. Additionally, most of the data are derived from the in-hospital stay with limited information on post-discharge VTE and efficacy of its prevention. Since there are studies indicating an increased risk of VTE after liver surgery compared to other oncological surgery, many advocate prolonged prophylaxis of 4 weeks to all patients undergoing liver surgery for malignancy and this seems to be feasible without increased risk of bleeding complications. Others only recommend prolonged duration to high-risk patients using individual risk stratification tools (for example Padua prediction score) to define high-risk patients. Antithrombin III (AT III) deficiency and PHLF must be considered as confounding factors. Liver resections of a limited extent performed by minimally invasive approach carry less risks and these patients could be considered for less than 4 weeks of LMWH, unless individual other risk factors exist related to chronic conditions. Q3 What anticoagulation should be used when performing hepatectomy with portal vein resection and reconstruction? There is no strong evidence for specific perioperative prevention strategy of PVT in patients undergoing liver surgery with portal vein resection and reconstruction. The approach should be tailored according to the patient-specific factors and clinical judgement. Recommendation grade: conditional | median level of evidence: 2\u2212 (range: 1+ to 2\u2212) Expert panel comment In 2016, Miyazaki et al. analysed 270 patients who underwent a portal vein resection (including end-to-end anastomosis, patch or segmental graft, and venorrhaphy) after 74 hepatectomies and 196 pancreatectomies. They introduced a systemic heparinization (200\u2013240 units/kg/day) from the first postoperative day to 7 postoperative days. They recorded postoperative PVT in 24 patients (8.9%), 16 out of 74 patients (21.6%) after hepatectomy and 8 out of 188 patients (4.3%) after pancreatectomy. Molina et al. reported a policy of a prophylactic LMWH to all patients who underwent hepatectomy for perihilar cholangiocarcinoma, moving to administration every 12 h for patients with vascular resection. Considering lack of evidence on this topic, a tailored approach may be applied according to patient-specific factors. Ejaz et al. found that patients with previous history of VTE, prolonged operative time (OR 1.17 per additional hour (95% c.i. 1.04 to 1.32); P = 0.009) and increased length of stay were independent risk factors for VTE. Unfortunately, no direct mention has been made regarding PVT in patients who received a vascular resection and reconstruction during hepatectomy. Q4 Is there a role for defining early and late PVT after liver resection? Defining early and late PVT after liver resection should be considered with the aim to standardize outcomes. A widely accepted definition specific to liver resection is lacking. A 30-day cut-off, as used in liver transplantation, is a pragmatic approach that may be adopted, with limitations related to partially different pathophysiological causes of PVT after liver resection compared to liver transplantation. Recommendation grade: conditional | median level of evidence: no evidence available Expert panel comment Early PVT is typically related to immediate postoperative factors, such as direct surgical manipulation or technical failure, intraoperative haemodynamic changes, or pro-thrombotic conditions. The detection of very early postoperative PVT would necessitate a routine imaging protocol, such as Doppler ultrasonography within 48 h of major liver surgery. Late PVT, occurring after 30 days, often reflects long-term processes, including liver regeneration and altered portal venous flow. Proposed post-resection PVT classification system include categories according to the site of the thrombus but do not reflect the time aspect. The decision for a 30-day cut-off is a practical solution to distinguish these phases but remains somewhat arbitrary and may require further validation. Defining PVT according to the time of onset may be useful for academic purposes. From a clinical point of view, the cut-off should also consider the management strategy for PVT, such as anticoagulation or invasive interventions, as these approaches may differ based on the timing, location, and nature of the thrombosis. Early PVT may more often require reoperation, late PVT is often asymptomatic, detected on follow-up imaging and can be mainly managed by anticoagulation. Q5 Are there differences in the treatment of early and late PVT after liver resection? There are no high-quality comparative studies to establish standardized treatment algorithms for early and late PVT after liver resection. Treatment options include anticoagulation, surgical intervention, and interventional radiology procedures. The decision on treatment strategy should be adjusted according to the time onset, thrombus extent and site, patient-specific factors, and institutional resources. Recommendation grade: conditional | median level of evidence: no evidence available Expert panel comment Early PVT poses a significant risk of complications such as liver failure, portal hypertension, or bowel ischaemia and requires timely intervention. Treatment strategies depend not only on the extent (partial versus total), timing (early versus late), and duration of existence of the thrombosis, but also on the site and on the patient\u2019s conditions at the time of diagnosis. A surgical approach can be considered for early thrombosis at the site of reconstruction, as one of the possible causes is a technical factor following the index procedure. The administration of anticoagulation aims to prevent thrombosis extension and related decrease in portal venous flow, which may result in portal hypertension and liver failure. Late PVT management focuses on addressing long-term complications, such as chronic portal hypertension, with tailored anticoagulation strategies based on follow-up imaging. While institutional resources play a crucial role in determining the feasibility of specific interventions, such as advanced interventional radiology or surgical expertise, there remains a significant gap in high-level evidence to support specific recommendations.", "type": "Document"}

For liver surgery prophylaxis, antibiotic choice should align with local pathogen resistance patterns. First-generation cephalosporins such as cefazolin are preferred for livers with naive bile ducts, administered within 60 min before incision. Broader-spectrum agents, like ceftriaxone or piperacillin/tazobactam, are conditionally recommended for high-risk cases. Consultation with a microbiologist should be considered in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)-risk settings. In \u03b2-lactam allergic patients, fosfomycin or aminoglycosides should be selected. Recommendation grade: conditional | median level of evidence: 2++ (range: 1++ to 2+) Expert panel comment Guidelines for prophylactic antibiotics in liver surgery emphasize the need to balance infection prevention with antibiotic stewardship. Currently, there is no conclusive evidence to either support or refute the routine use of antibiotic prophylaxis for all liver resections. Cefazolin, a first-generation cephalosporin, is however recommended for standard liver resections due to its effectiveness in reducing SSIs and its minimal impact on 30-day readmission rates. Administered 1 h before surgery, cefazolin provides reliable coverage for clean-contaminated procedures, addressing the infection risk in most patients undergoing liver resection. For higher-risk patients, broader-spectrum antibiotics like third-generation cephalosporins or \u03b2-lactam/\u03b2-lactamase inhibitors may be appropriate, providing enhanced coverage against Gram-negative and anaerobic pathogens. The decision to use these alternatives should consider patient risk factors and local resistance trends. Although effective, these agents are recommended conditionally, given the moderate-quality evidence supporting their use in specific cases. For patients at risk of MRSA infection, adding vancomycin to the prophylactic regimen is suggested, but should be guided by local resistance data and individual patient factors as well as consultation with an infectious disease specialist to prevent resistance development. Aminoglycosides are reserved due to nephrotoxicity concerns and are recommended only for cases with specific coverage needs. This framework reflects a careful, evidence-based approach prioritizing effective prophylaxis while mitigating antibiotic resistance risks. Q2 Which patients should be defined as high risk for developing clinically relevant SSI following hepatectomy? Patients at higher risk of SSI can be characterized by bacterial colonization resistant to commonly used prophylactic antibiotics or by factors which make them generally more at risk for postoperative complications like underlying liver disease, preoperative biliary drainage, and synchronous resections of the gastrointestinal tract. In patients who undergo preoperative biliary drainage, cultures should be obtained at the time of the intervention. In case of bile duct resection and reconstruction, intraoperative biliary cultures should be obtained during the surgical procedure. Recommendation grade: conditional | median level of evidence: 2+ (range: 1++ to 2+) Expert panel comment Several risk factors are associated with a higher risk of developing SSI following hepatectomy. Most of the evidence comes from multivariable analyses of retrospective observational studies, with very few RCTs addressing this issue. Patients at high risk for developing clinically relevant SSIs after hepatectomy can be categorized based on the preoperative, surgical, and postoperative risk factors. Preoperative risk factors (moderate to high level of evidence) include patient-related factors (obesity, diabetes mellitus, chronic pulmonary diseases, and chronic cardiac diseases, preoperative anaemia, malnutrition, or hypoalbuminemia, colonization with bacteria resistant to commonly used perioperative antibiotics), liver-related factors (hepatolithiasis, chronic liver disease, biliary obstruction, or preoperative biliary drainage) and technical or logistic factors (previous liver resection, planned bilioenteric anastomosis, prior hospitalization). Surgical risk factors (moderate level of evidence) comprehend high volumes of intravenous fluids, blood transfusion, prolonged operation time, and concomitant bowel surgery. Finally, persistent postoperative elevation of inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) or bile leakage are examples of postoperative risk factors (moderate level of evidence). Despite these risk factors, clear criteria for identifying such high-risk patients are not yet well defined. Q3 Which patients are likely to benefit from extended antibiotic prophylaxis? Although antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended, extended postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis for more than 24 h has not demonstrated any additional benefit in preventing postoperative infections after standard hepatectomies. Patients at high risk for developing clinically relevant SSI may benefit from extended antimicrobic duration (3\u20135 days postoperatively). Recommendation grade: conditional | median level of evidence: 2+ (range: 1+ to 2+) Expert panel comment Data derived from RCTs are mainly available for standard hepatectomies. There is lack of evidence supporting routine extended (3\u20135 days postoperatively) antibiotic prophylaxis after standard liver resection, aligning with principles of antibiotic stewardship. Patients at high risk for developing clinically relevant SSI may benefit from extended antimicrobic duration. The emphasis on tailoring prolonged prophylaxis to high-risk patients, particularly those with preoperative biliary drainage, or complex procedures, is consistent with findings from recent studies. However, the recommendation would benefit from a clearer stratification of risk factors and more specific guidance on how intraoperative cultures should influence postoperative antimicrobial strategies. In addition, defining indications (for example bile contamination, duration of surgery, or intraoperative findings) for initiating extended prophylaxis would enhance clinical applicability. Future prospective studies are needed to refine high-risk criteria and validate targeted protocols. Q4 What is the role of antibiotic treatment in cases of postoperative fever of unknown origin and no suspicion of infection or sepsis following liver resection? Antibiotic therapy is not routinely recommended for postoperative fever of unknown origin if diagnostic work-up excluded any signs of infection or sepsis. Patients at high risk\u2014such as those with preoperative biliary drainages, bilioenteric anastomosis, immunosuppression, or co-morbidities like diabetes mellitus\u2014may benefit from targeted antibiotic therapy, if early signs of infection are present. Recommendation grade: strong | median level of evidence: 1+ (range: 1++ to 2+) Expert panel comment Postoperative fever after hepatectomy can arise from both infectious and non-infectious causes. Routine use of antibiotics for fever of unknown origin is generally discouraged due to the risk of promoting multidrug-resistant bacteria and complicating future antibiotic selection for septic events. If indicated, empirical antibiotic treatment should be guided by the severity of infection, patient-specific risk factors, and local antibiotic sensitivity patterns, covering common pathogens like Enterococcus species and Gram-negative bacteria until specific pathogens are identified. Assessing preoperative bacterial colonization in patients with biliary abnormalities is crucial and is supported by high-level evidence, aiding in implementing targeted antibiotic strategies when necessary. This tailored approach aims to improve perioperative outcomes in selected high-risk patients while minimizing the development of antibiotic resistance.", "type": "Document"}
{"id": null, "metadata": {"source": "PMC12750329.txt", "chunk_id": 1121, "char_count": 11421}, "page_content": "### Topic 3: prehabilitation/nutrition/mobilization\nQ1 What is the value of a prehabilitation programme in patients undergoing hepatectomy? Multimodal prehabilitation programmes (exercise training, nutritional optimization, psychological interventions) should be considered for patients prior to hepatectomy for both benign and malignant liver disease following assessment to reduce postoperative morbidity and length of hospital stay. Recommendation grade: strong | median level of evidence: 1+ (1++ to 2++) Expert panel comment Prehabilitation programmes (including physical exercise training, diet optimization, psychological interventions, smoking cessation, alcohol cessation) may have positive impact on outcomes after hepatectomy, especially for malignant liver disease (30-day morbidity reduced: trend, no effect; length of hospital stay shortened: significant, trend, no effect; length of intensive care stay shortened; quality of life (QoL) improved). No effect of prehabilitation on postoperative mortality was shown in two meta-analyses. The content of prehabilitation programmes evaluated for liver or hepatopancreatobiliary surgery is heterogeneous, with one RCT evaluating exercise training after cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) as a unimodal intervention and four meta-analyses and three RCTs evaluating multimodal programmes including in-hospital or home-based physical exercise training, dietary interventions, or psychological support. The literature is inconsistent on the duration of a prehabilitation programme, with recently published guidelines suggesting 3\u20136 weeks before major oncological surgery. For exercise training prior to liver surgery, a minimum of 4 weeks preoperatively has been evaluated in five meta-analyses and RCTs. Alcohol and smoking cessation as part of prehabilitation is recommended for surgery in general, with at least 4 weeks of cessation prior to hepatectomy. Due to the heterogeneity of the outcomes assessed in the included studies, no clear recommendation can be made, indicating the need for further standardized research to assess prehabilitation in liver surgery. Q2 What is the influence of preoperative body composition on outcomes in patients undergoing hepatectomy? Preoperative body composition influences outcomes in patients undergoing hepatectomy for various conditions of liver malignancies. Therefore, preoperative screening for low skeletal muscle mass (LSMM) should be done in every patient considered for hepatectomy for liver malignancies. Recommendation grade: strong | median level of evidence: 1+ (1+ to 2+) Expert panel comment At least seven systematic reviews have pointed out \u2018sarcopenia\u2019 or LSMM as major risk factors for overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in patients undergoing hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and for postoperative complication rates in resection for colorectal-liver metastasis (CRLM). Only one high-quality meta-analysis investigated the impact of obesity on OS and DFS in patients undergoing resection for CRLM; no significant impact was found. Preoperative screening for LSMM should be performed in every patient undergoing hepatectomy for liver malignancies, as it shows significant impact on postoperative outcomes. Therefore, CT scans seem to be a good option, as they are routinely used in oncological patients for staging examination and broadly accessible. As sarcopenia is defined as loss of muscle mass, reduced function, and impaired muscle strength, the term \u2018sarcopenia\u2019 should only be used if diagnosed according to the guidelines. If diagnosed preoperatively, addressing LSMM and sarcopenia with nutritional support (for example protein supplementation) and physical activity should be considered. There is only limited high-quality evidence for explaining the influence of obesity on outcome in patients undergoing hepatic resection, hence further research is needed. Q3 What is the role of fitness screening and assessment in patients undergoing hepatectomy? As aerobic fitness is an important modifiable risk factor and can be improved by a prehabilitation programme, screening for this risk factor can be incorporated as a routine part of the preoperative assessment for patients undergoing liver surgery, particularly for those with borderline or reduced fitness, as it provides critical information for optimizing perioperative care and improving postoperative outcomes. Recommendation grade: conditional | median level of evidence: 1- (1\u2212 to 2+) Expert panel comment Fitness assessment allows for risk stratification and the identification of potential modifiable risk factors. Aerobic fitness has a strong relationship with postoperative outcomes. Ideally it is measured by CPET, alternatively by Steep Ramp Test (STRT), Six-Minute Walk Test (6MWT), or Thirty-Second Sit-to-Stand Test (30ST). Lower CPET-derived thresholds, specifically Anaerobic Threshold values below 9.0\u201311.5 ml/kg/min and Volume of Oxygen peak below 15 ml/kg/min, have been associated with increased risks of postoperative complications, longer hospital stays, and poorer OS. These markers serve as reliable predictors for identifying high-risk patients and are used to guide clinical decisions regarding the need for prehabilitation interventions and perioperative management. CPET offers superior predictive accuracy compared to simpler tests such as the Incremental Shuttle Walk Test (ISWT) or the STRT, which have shown limited precision in predicting postoperative outcome. Despite their practicality, these alternative tests are not as sensitive or specific as CPET in evaluating fitness for liver surgery. Q4 Does perioperative immunonutrition offer a benefit in patients undergoing hepatectomy? Immunonutrition can be administered as perioperative nutritional supplementation in patients undergoing hepatectomy as it has a positive effect on postoperative liver function and might foster the regenerative potential especially in vulnerable populations. Recommendation grade: conditional | median level of evidence: 1\u2212 (1++ to 2+) Expert panel comment A review of nine RCTs with 966 patients, including administration of \u03c9-3-fatty acids (FAs), arginine/glutamine, and RNA applications, found improvement in complication rates, overall postoperative infectious complications, and wound infections and a beneficial effect on the length of hospital stay. No effects of immunonutrition could be found on recurrence in patients with HCC. In an RCT of 320 patients undergoing resection for HCC, the intervention group, however, profited significantly from postoperative parenteral administration of \u03c9-3-FAs with regard to complications and infections. A meta-analysis confirmed the findings in 11 RCTs (>1000 patients) with an improved clinical course reflected by lower complications. The timing of the intervention was heterogeneous (pre/post), as well as the duration, which lasted from 30 days preoperatively until 3 weeks postoperatively. Regimens were also heterogeneous and consisted of \u03c9-3-FAs alone \u00b1 ribonucleic acids \u00b1 glutamine/arginine supplementation either enterally or fully parenterally. Q5 What is the role of prokinetic policies to improve time to first bowel movement/full standard diet? Routine use of postoperative prokinetics or laxatives is recommended to stimulate bowel movement after hepatectomy, while prokinetics may shorten the time to first flatus or stool. In patients who have had a simultaneous liver and colonic resection, use of prokinetic treatment should be used with caution and based upon established colorectal protocols. Recommendation grade: conditional | median level of evidence: 1+ (1++ to 2+) Expert panel comment At least four RCTs and one case\u2013control prospective study have shown that the use of prokinetics such as postoperative laxatives, gum chewing, or herbal medicine after hepatectomy reduce the time to first flatus or stool. Prokinetics did however not reduce secondary outcomes, such as delayed gastric emptying, length of stay, or time to functional recovery. While some members of the expert panel suggested that time to first flatus or stool is not a clinically relevant endpoint in liver surgery, others argued that this might have a positive impact on patients\u2019 well-being and QoL. Q6 When and how should artificial nutrition be added to oral nutrition in the postoperative period? Early oral nutrition should be preferred after hepatectomy. In patients requiring artificial nutrition support (malnourished patients, patients with complications causing several days of fasting), enteral nutrition through a nasofeeding tube should be preferred over total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Nutritional specialist assessment is recommended for patients with delayed oral intake. Recommendation grade: conditional | median level of evidence: 1\u2212 (1++ to 2++) Expert panel comment Early oral diet has been shown to be safe and to decrease the time to first bowel movement in abdominal and liver surgery. The European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) guidelines on clinical nutrition in surgery recommend oral nutrition postoperatively. A recent RCT of patients undergoing major abdominal surgery reported beneficial effects on nosocomial infections from early parenteral nutritional support in addition to oral intake, compared with delayed parenteral nutrition. Two meta-analyses suggest that, for patients at risk of impaired oral intake over a prolonged period, enteral nutrition through a nasofeeding tube should be preferred over TPN whenever possible. Q7 How should (early) postoperative mobilization after hepatectomy be defined? The ideal prescription on postoperative mobilization after hepatic surgery is not clear. Early mobilization after liver surgery should start immediately on postoperative day 1 with assisted active mobilization and sitting out of bed. Walking (with no precise target) should start at least on second postoperative day adapted to the patient\u2019s functional capacity and carefully supervised especially in elderly or frail patients. Recommendation grade: strong | median level of evidence: 1+ (1++ to 2+) Expert panel comment Either resistance or endurance training should be part of the mobilization for this patient population. No literature was found on the realistic endpoints in early mobilization of elderly or frail patients. In two RCTs and two prospective cohort studies, postoperative mobilization has shown an improvement of functional capacity. Only one study showed a reduction of the length of stay and consequently a cost-saving effect. No meta-analysis on this topic was found. Two prospective cohort studies recommend activity tracking, which might detect postsurgical complications in vulnerable patients and enhance the recovery. Even though no study that provides a precise answer on this question was found, the authors agree that patients with a preoperative reduced level of physical activity require additional attention in the postoperative period. Especially for elderly or frail patients undergoing major surgery monitoring postoperative activity might be useful in identifying postsurgical complications. One RCT with 108 patients showed that early mobilization reduces the risk for inability to walk without human assistance at postoperative day 5 or hospital discharge. No differences were however found regarding clinical outcomes or complications.", "type": "Document"}

Intraoperative bile leak tests can be considered after liver resection, especially in major resections or complex procedures, recording use in the operation report. No specific test has shown clear superiority regarding identification of leaks, although the gauze (surface) test and the \u2018white test\u2019 might be preferred. Therefore, the choice of test should depend on centre expertise and availability. Recommendation grade: conditional (major/complex resections: strong) | median level of evidence: 1\u2212 (range: 1++ to 4) Expert panel comment Intraoperative bile leak testing plays an important role in identifying bile leaks at the resection plane during hepatectomy, especially after complex resections. Bile leaks, if undetected, can lead to potentially serious complications such as bile peritonitis and intra-abdominal abscesses. There are several tests available, including the injection of different substances into the bile ducts, such as air, saline, methylene blue, lipid-based solutions (\u2018white test\u2019), or ICG, standard cholangiography, and a simple stain test using gauze. The \u2018white test\u2019 is a cost-effective technique that has been shown to reduce postoperative bile leak rates in several studies, including two RCTs, by enabling intraoperative detection and immediate intervention. It is important to be aware this test may not detect disconnected segments. There is an ongoing RCT comparing the white test to the gauze test, with results expected in 2025. ICG fluorescence imaging offers near-infrared visualization of bile ducts. While some retrospective studies and smaller trials suggest potential advantages of ICG in complex cases due to improved anatomical delineation, available RCT data indicate that ICG has not shown clear superiority over simpler and more accessible techniques regarding bile leak detection rates and clinical outcomes. Despite one ongoing prospective trial, further large-scale RCTs are necessary to conclusively determine the role of ICG for bile leak prevention. Q2 Is there a role for drainage after hepatectomy without bilioenteric reconstruction? Routine abdominal drainage after an uncomplicated hepatectomy should be avoided. Recommendation grade: strong | median level of evidence: 1+ (range: 1++ to 2+) Expert panel comment The role of routine abdominal drainage after hepatectomy without bilioenteric reconstruction has been extensively debated, with current evidence strongly suggesting that it should be avoided in uncomplicated cases. A meta-analysis, which included seven RCTs involving 1064 patients, demonstrated that postoperative drainage did not only fail to reduce the incidence of intra-abdominal collections requiring intervention but also increased the risk of overall and wound-related complications. This finding is supported by earlier publications, such as a Cochrane review, which concluded that routine drainage did not provide significant benefits in uncomplicated liver resections. Similarly, there was no advantage to routine drainage after elective hepatectomy using the crush clamp method in an RCT. Furthermore, Liu et al. highlighted that abdominal drainage is particularly contraindicated in patients with chronic liver diseases, as it may exacerbate complications without improving outcomes. Despite these findings, some specific high-risk scenarios might still warrant drain placement. Dezfouli et al. and Brooke-Smith et al. have suggested that drainage could be considered in patients with resections involving difficult anatomical locations, such as the right superior segments, or when intraoperative bile leaks are detected and concerns have risen about adequate control. Additionally, in settings where interventional radiology is not readily available, drainage may serve as a precautionary measure. The consensus, supported by systematic reviews, is however that routine drainage after uncomplicated hepatectomy is unnecessary and may even be harmful. Q3 What is the value of biliary transanastomotic stents in complex bilioenteric anastomoses in hepatectomy? Transanastomotic stents can be considered in complex bilioenteric anastomoses (that is extended resections, small bile ducts, friable tissue) but are not recommended for routine use. If used, they should be removed within 3 months to minimize complications. The choice of transanastomotic stent depends on centre availability and expertise. Recommendation grade: conditional | median level of evidence: 2\u2212 (range: 2++ to 4) Expert panel comment Bilioenteric anastomotic leakage remains a challenging complication. It is associated with prolonged hospitalization and mortality. The decision to use transanastomotic stents in small ducts or high-risk anastomoses is still common practice aiming to reduce risk of complications. It remains however a topic of debate and stenting should be based on specific risks associated with the patient and the surgical procedure. Recent studies have identified several factors associated with bilioenteric anastomotic leakage. Risk factors can be related to the surgical procedure (complex surgeries/compromised tissue) and to patient factors (co-morbidities/previous surgery or radiation treatment). Removal of these stents within 3 months is recommended to minimize side effects such as cholangitis and strictures. Whether their routine use is indicated remains unclear, even if most (low evidence) studies have shown no benefit. Currently, there is no evidence supporting the use of self-resorbable transanastomotic stents. In a large, multicentre study, preoperative biliary drainage was independently associated with a lower risk of anastomotic bile leakage, while postoperative external biliary drainage showed an association with higher leakage rates in univariable analysis. It was not an independent risk factor in multivariable analysis however. Separately, the use of postoperative external biliary drains has also been identified as an independent risk factor for clinically relevant PHLF in patients undergoing major liver resection for perihilar cholangiocarcinoma. The choice of anastomotic technique has not been shown to be a relevant factor for the incidence of bile leakage in Braunwarth et al.. Other studies underscore the value of specific surgical techniques and modifications in enhancing biliary reconstruction success, such as basin-shaped hepaticojejunostomy and a modified hepatojejunostomy technique using internal and external stents. Q4 Is there a role for routine imaging (CT, magnetic resonance (MR) cholangiography) in patients at high risk for bile leaks? Routine use of advanced imaging modalities such as CT, MR, or single-photon emission CT (SPECT) is not recommended for asymptomatic patients at high risk due to their cost and limited availability in most healthcare settings. For patients with suspected or detected bile leaks, the threshold for performing radiological imaging should be low. The choice of modality should be guided by the resources available at the treating centre. Recommendation grade: conditional | median level of evidence: 3 (range: 3) Expert panel comment Patients with suspected bile leakage originating from the resection margin or a central bile duct, whether presenting with high or low output, benefit from prompt radiological detection using, depending on local availability, ultrasound, CT scan, or more specialized imaging like bile-specific gadolinium-enhanced MR cholangiography (Gd-MR) or mebrofenin SPECT-CT. MR cholangiography, particularly contrast-enhanced MR, is especially reliable for identifying bile leaks following hepatobiliary surgery and may reduce the need for other, potentially risky invasive diagnostic procedures. Post-hepatectomy bile leak has been defined and graded by the International Study Group of Liver Surgery (ISGLS), allowing objective comparison of the degree and severity of bile leaks. The following risk factors for postoperative bile leakage are widely accepted: preoperative risk factors\u2014anaemia, liver cirrhosis, mechanical jaundice, chemotherapy with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibodies (bevacizumab), positive bacterial culture (bile swab), and reoperations (for reasons other than bile leakage); and intraoperative and surgical risk factors\u2014major or complex hepatic resections including mesohepatectomies, vascular resections or reconstructions, re-resections, and central bile duct resections. Additional risk factors include operation time, blood loss, and Pringle manoeuvre (PM). Q5 What is the role of endoscopy and interventional radiology in patients with clinically relevant bile leakage after hepatectomy? In case of a clinically relevant bile leakage (>100 ml bile/24 h) when a drain is in place, an early endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and stent placement seems sensible as a strategy to resolve bile leakage quickly. When the patient has a bilioma with no drain in place, the first step should be percutaneous drainage; ERCP/stent should follow on the same conditions as above. Recommendation grade: conditional | median level of evidence: 2\u2212 (1+ to 4) Expert panel comment Management of bile leakage relies strongly on locally available resources and experience. Recommendations are made in the context of healthcare systems where all available interventions are in place. This might not always be the case in clinical practice. Therefore, recruitment of external expertise might be needed occasionally. RCTs comparing early versus late ERCP/stent could so far not conclusively answer which approach is superior.", "type": "Document"}
{"id": null, "metadata": {"source": "PMC12750329.txt", "chunk_id": 1123, "char_count": 10883}, "page_content": "### Topic 5: PHH\nQ1 What is the role of preoperative strategies to reduce blood loss associated with liver resection (fat-reducing diet, nutritional changes, hypovolaemic phlebotomy)? In patients who are overweight or obese, the implementation of a low-calorie, low-fat diet should be considered, provided that the surgical timeline permits adequate intervention. Preoperative management of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) should align with the recommendations of the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL)\u2013European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD)\u2013European Association for the Study of Obesity (EASO) Clinical Practice Guidelines. In selected patients at high risk of significant intraoperative bleeding, preoperative hypovolaemic phlebotomy may be considered as a strategy to reduce transfusion requirements. Recommendation grade: strong | median level of evidence: 2\u2212 (range: 1++ to 3) Expert panel comment There is growing evidence that targeted preoperative strategies can reduce blood loss in patients undergoing liver resection, particularly those with MASLD. Patients with MASLD have been shown to have a 1.8-fold higher risk of postoperative bleeding, as highlighted in a recent meta-analysis underscoring the need for tailored perioperative approaches. Nutritional interventions, especially short-term dietary restrictions, have demonstrated promising results. A small RCT found that a 1-week, 800-kcal/day diet with 20 g fat and 70 g protein significantly reduced intraoperative blood loss. These findings are supported by retrospective data showing similar benefits with calorie- and fat-restricted diets. Such regimens likely reduce hepatic steatosis and liver volume, improving resectability and surgical safety. Additionally, hypovolaemic phlebotomy has re-emerged as a strategy to control intraoperative bleeding. Data of meta-analyses and the recent PRICE-2 trial both demonstrated that preoperative venesection reduces transfusion requirements without increasing complication rates. These findings support its selective use in high-risk patients. Q2 What is the role of anaesthetic management to reduce blood loss in patients undergoing hepatectomy? Intraoperative low central venous pressure (CVP) should be maintained until completion of parenchymal transection to reduce blood loss and transfusion requirements. No specific anaesthetic agent is recommended. Tranexamic acid (TXA) is not advised in liver resection for cancer as it does not decrease blood loss during liver resection. The role of acute normovolaemic haemodilution (ANH) remains unclear. Recommendation grade: moderate to strong | median level of evidence: 2++ (range: 1+ to 2\u2212) Expert panel comment Anaesthetic expertise in liver surgery is critical in reducing intraoperative blood loss during liver resection. Data from meta-analyses of RCTs support the use of low CVP until completion of parenchymal transection. This strategy significantly reduces blood loss, shortens operating time, lowers transfusion requirements, and decreases postoperative complications, and is considered both safe and effective in adult patients undergoing hepatectomy. While certain anaesthetic agents may influence hepatic blood flow and mitigate ischaemia-reperfusion injury, particularly volatile inhalational agents metabolized by the liver, current data do not support a definitive recommendation for one agent over another in terms of bleeding outcomes. More targeted studies are needed to establish clear guidance. The use of TXA during liver resection for cancer is not supported by recent evidence. The HeLiX trial (n = 2145) found no reduction in intraoperative or early postoperative bleeding, transfusion needs, or VTE. Notably, TXA was associated with a higher rate of complications. The role of ANH remains uncertain. While ANH may reduce the proportion of patients requiring transfusion, it does not appear to lower total transfused volume or improve postoperative outcomes, including morbidity and mortality. Q3 What is the role for intraoperative liver inflow occlusion in reducing intraoperative blood loss? Inflow occlusion techniques such as the PM and hemihepatic occlusion (HHO) can reduce intraoperative blood loss and should be considered when major bleeding is anticipated. While intermittent Pringle occlusion is safe for up to 120 min, prolonged clamping may increase the risk of ischaemia-reperfusion injury, particularly in patients with underlying liver dysfunction. Recommendation grade: moderate | median level of evidence: 2+ (range: 1++ to 2\u2212) Expert panel comment Intraoperative liver inflow occlusion, most commonly via the PM, is a widely adopted technique to minimize blood loss during hepatic transection. Comparative studies have evaluated PM against HHO, but findings remain mixed. A 2011 meta-analysis of four RCTs involving 338 patients found no significant differences in intraoperative outcomes between PM and HHO, aside from higher aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels on postoperative day 1 in the PM group, indicating transient hepatic injury. A meta-analysis including eight RCTs and 688 patients published in 2019 reported significantly lower perioperative morbidity in the HHO group; no significant differences were however observed in liver-specific complications such as bile leak, PHLF, postoperative haemorrhage, and transfusion rates, but transfused volume per patient was higher in the PM group. Some evidence from a propensity-matched analysis indicated that patients with normal liver function may experience worse outcomes with PM compared to no occlusion, potentially due to ischaemia-reperfusion injury. While inflow occlusion is effective in limiting blood loss, it is not without risk. Prolonged continuous clamping can lead to ischaemia-reperfusion injury, particularly in patients with liver dysfunction. For this reason, intermittent PM\u2014typically in 20-min cycles with 5-min reperfusion intervals\u2014has been shown to be safe for total occlusion times up to 120 min, particularly in patients with preserved liver function. Q4 Is there an influence of parenchymal transection technique on blood loss? Meta-analyses of RCTs suggest that bipolar energy devices may reduce intraoperative blood loss during parenchymal transection. However, due to the wide range of available techniques, the limited number of direct comparisons, and methodological variability across studies, no specific recommendation can currently be made regarding the optimal transection technique. Recommendation grade: moderate | median level of evidence: 1+ (range: 1++ to 2\u2212) Expert panel comment Parenchymal transection represents a critical phase of partial hepatectomy, with the potential to significantly influence intraoperative blood loss and postoperative complications. Multiple techniques and devices have been developed to facilitate safe and efficient transection. These range from the traditional clamp-crushing technique, which involves blunt dissection of the parenchyma with a Kelly clamp followed by clipping or ligation of vascular and biliary structures, to energy-based devices such as bipolar cautery, ultrasonic dissectors, and vascular staplers. Over the past two decades, numerous RCTs have compared these techniques with respect to key perioperative outcomes, particularly intraoperative blood loss and postoperative complication rates\u2014most notably bile leakage. Individual trials often yield conflicting results however due to differences in methodology and patient populations. A 2020 systematic review and network meta-analysis of 22 RCTs sought to synthesize this evidence and found that bipolar energy devices were associated with the greatest reduction in intraoperative blood loss. Nevertheless, Kamarajah et al.162 noted that cross-trial comparisons were limited by heterogeneity in surgical practices such as CVP management and use of vascular inflow occlusion. In conclusion, while certain transection techniques may offer modest advantages, particularly in reducing blood loss, the overall evidence remains inconclusive due to variability in study design and surgical context. Q5 What is the value of haemostatic agents to reduce blood loss in patients undergoing hepatectomy? No specific recommendations can be made as to the use of topical haemostats. The time to haemostasis is shorter when using topical haemostatic agents (fibrin sealant) but there is no significant difference in perioperative blood transfusion. There is no evidence of one individual topical sealant being superior to another. Recommendation grade: moderate | median level of evidence: 1+ (range: 1++ to 2\u2212) Expert panel comment Topical haemostatic agents, including matrix-based products, fibrin sealants, and their combination\u2014known as carrier-bound fibrin sealants\u2014are widely used in liver surgery for secondary haemostasis. Despite their popularity, the level of evidence supporting their effectiveness in reducing blood loss remains low. A meta-analysis evaluating carrier-bound fibrin sealants in open and laparoscopic liver surgery, as well as transplantation, included RCTs, large retrospective cohort studies, and case\u2013control studies. While time to haemostasias was shorter in the carrier-bound fibrin sealant group, the use of these agents did not significantly affect the risk of intraoperative blood transfusion, postoperative fluid collections, or bile leakage. Additionally, a network meta-analysis of 20 RCTs comparing different topical haemostatic agents reported that fibrin glue and fibrin patches were the most effective in achieving haemostasis at both 4 and 10 min. No significant differences were however observed among agents in terms of overall blood loss, transfusion requirements, bile leak, postoperative complications, reoperation rates, or mortality. Overall, while certain agents may improve time to haemostasis, their routine use does not appear to influence key perioperative outcomes in liver surgery. Q6 Does minimally invasive surgery (MIS) influence blood loss in patients undergoing hepatectomy? MIS does not reduce blood loss compared to open liver surgery for minor or major hepatectomy. MIS liver surgery may be associated with less blood loss in some conditions (that is HCC) based on non-randomized observations. Recommendation grade: strong (minor/major hepatectomy), conditional (HCC) | median level of evidence: 1\u2212 (range: 1++ to 2\u2212) Expert panel comment In selected patients, MIS may decrease perioperative blood loss compared to the open approach. This is however only found when looking at specific resections (that is HCC) and most prominently in left lateral resections and in uncontrolled data comparisons. Neither the Orange III RCT nor the COMET RCT demonstrated a statistically significant difference in blood loss attributable to the surgical approach.", "type": "Document"}

PHLF involves complex and heterogeneous pathophysiological mechanisms and classification as primary and secondary PHLF can be considered, because it impacts on preventive and therapeutic interventions and prognosis. Recommendation grade: conditional | median level of evidence: 2+ (range: 1+ to 3) Expert panel comment Primary PHLF defines liver failure (increased international normalized ratio (INR) and bilirubin according to local laboratory normal value ranges) and clinical signs of hepatic encephalopathy that occurs within days after liver resection (usual time frame within 3 weeks). Primary PHLF includes \u2018small-for-size\u2019 PHLF, in which the liver remnant is insufficient to maintain essential hepatic function, and iatrogenic PHLF, in which surgical injury of vital structures or excessive blood loss prevent sufficient function of the liver remnant. Secondary PHLF occurs after an initial partial stabilization/recovery of hepatic function (usual time frame within 3 months after surgery) and is often complicated/aggravated by infections or hepatic vasculature thrombosis. While postoperative outcome research has predominantly focused on the first 90 postoperative days, it should be noted that delayed hepatic decompensation after this period can occur, particularly if infectious complications arise. Recent evidence supports this concept, as impaired preoperative liver function and/or occurrence of non-PHLF postoperative hepatic dysfunction is associated with long-term survival after hepatic resection. This is particularly important as treatment strategies might differ between PHLF types. For example, Molecular Adsorbent Recirculating System (MARS) achieved better results as therapy of primary PHLF (especially if used early), while aggressive infection management is key in avoiding secondary PHLF. Further research is required to strengthen the evidence of subclassifying PHLF, particularly for defining delayed PHLF occurring after 90 days. Q2 Should patients suffering from PHLF be monitored beyond 90 days after hepatectomy? Primary and secondary PHLF usually occur within 90 days after surgery. Based on indirect evidence, PHLF monitoring beyond 90 days can be considered for patients who have recovered from PHLF independent of oncological follow-up. Recommendation grade: conditional | median level of evidence: 4 (range: 2+ to 4) Expert panel comment Primary and secondary PHLF occur within 90 days after liver resection. Delayed PHLF after 90 days\u2014after initial stabilization/recovery of liver function\u2014may occur, but further research is required to strengthen evidence for its definition, prediction, and management recommendations. Recent evidence suggests that preoperative liver function and/or the development of postoperative non-PHLF hepatic dysfunction represents a critical predictor for long-term survival after hepatic resection. Delayed PHLF may account for a significant proportion of post-resection mortality within 1 year, but strong supporting evidence is still missing. Monitoring beyond 90 days can be considered for those patients who have recovered from PHLF, but also for high-risk patients, who should be defined as per recent consensus guidelines. Q3 Which postoperative markers should be considered to monitor postoperative liver function recovery in patients at high risk of PHLF? The following parameters should be used to monitor liver function in patients at high risk of PHLF: bilirubin, INR, albumin, lactate, ammonia levels (in patients with signs of hepatic encephalopathy), AST, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), glucose, and temperature. Furthermore, infection monitoring by complete blood count (CBC) and CRP should be performed, as well as kidney function monitoring using creatinine. Recommendation grade: strong | median level of evidence: 2+ (range: 2+ to 4) Expert panel comment After hepatic resection the following parameters should be used to monitor liver function in patients at high risk of PHLF: bilirubin, INR, albumin, ammonia levels (in patients with signs of hepatic encephalopathy), glucose, temperature, aminotransferases (AST/ALT), infection markers (leucocytes, procalcitonin, and CRP), lactate, and kidney function (creatinine). If clinically indicated, radiological assessment of the liver perfusion (ultrasound or CT scan) can be helpful to identify vascular complications. In this context, high-risk patients should be defined as per recent consensus guidelines. Q4 Is there a value for early postoperative markers to predict PHLF? Several biomarkers (for example lactate, phosphate, platelets) have been reported to allow for early postoperative identification of PHLF and their measurement can be considered in high-risk patients after hepatic resection to initiate supportive treatment early. There are no comparative studies and future research is needed to identify the optimal biomarker. Recommendation grade: conditional | median level of evidence: 2+ (range: 2+ to 4) Expert panel comment The postoperative parameters reported to be useful for early identification of PHLF patients include lactate levels, fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) score, platelets, ICG clearance (intra- and postoperative), phosphate, AT III and CRP, scintigraphic parameters, thrombopoietin, and intrahepatic neutrophil accumulation. At this point in time direct comparisons of these markers are missing. Accordingly, no recommendation can be made regarding which parameter is superior. Given that supportive treatments (particularly for primary PHLF) should be initiated early, biomarker identification and comparison should become a key area of future research. Moreover, these markers will be instrumental for establishing and eventually initiating therapeutic interventions in the future. In this context, high-risk patients should be defined as per recent consensus guidelines. Q5 Which treatments are available to support hepatic regeneration in PHLF? Currently, no specific therapeutic interventions are available or approved to promote liver regeneration and avoid or treat progression of PHLF. Recommendation grade: strong | median level of evidence: 2+ (range: 1+ to 4) Expert panel comment Supportive care and aggressive management of potential causes of PHLF are recommended. While several treatments have been explored, no specific therapy is currently available. Antioxidant drugs, such as N-acetylcysteine, have shown mixed results for treatment of PHLF and their use is controversial. Bioartificial devices, mesenchymal stem cells, and new molecular targets are currently being explored in patients at risk of or already suffering from PHLF. Portal pressure modulators like terlipressin and somatostatin have demonstrated mixed results as well. Surgical modulation of portal pressure by splenectomy or splenic artery ligation has also been implicated in PHLF reduction. MARS and plasma exchange therapies have also been evaluated with inconsistent results. Liver transplantation is an effective treatment for fulminant PHLF but is seldomly possible given patient factors like oncological diagnosis or infections. Preoperative or early postoperative identification of high-risk patients remains key to enabling timely initiation of supportive treatments.", "type": "Document"}
{"id": null, "metadata": {"source": "PMC12750329.txt", "chunk_id": 1125, "char_count": 5609}, "page_content": "### Discussion\nThis consensus paper builds upon and complements the E-AHPBA\u2013ESSO\u2013European Society for Surgical Research (ESSR) Innsbruck consensus guidelines on preoperative liver function assessment published in BJS in 2023, providing a continuum of guidance from preoperative evaluation to postoperative care. Developed by a multidisciplinary expert panel, it aims to reduce practice variability and improve patient outcomes by synthesizing the best available evidence with the opinions and clinical knowledge of experts in the field. It provides a structured framework for peri- and postoperative management in patients undergoing liver resection, addressing six critical domains: thromboprophylaxis, antibiotics, prehabilitation, bile leak, bleeding, and liver failure. A total of 32 statements were generated. Even though the review of the literature revealed that most of the available evidence informing these recommendations is limited in both quantity and quality, the expert panel has identified key practices that, if implemented, are believed to support improved outcomes in peri- and postoperative care following liver surgery. This consensus recommendation is subject to several limitations. These include heterogeneity of definitions, particularly regarding perioperative complications but also regarding liver surgery procedures and indications. The variability in the application of interventions such as prehabilitation, thromboprophylaxis, and bile leak management limit generalizability. Several recommendations also rely on advanced diagnostics and therapeutics not universally available, challenging implementation across diverse healthcare settings. Many of the recommendations have been based on low- to moderate-quality evidence, often derived from retrospective analyses, institutional protocols, or expert opinion, due to the lack of high-quality RCTs in key areas. As with many expert consensus processes, the strength of the recommendations reflects both the current evidence base and clinical judgment. It is necessary to consider the demographic and geographical composition, as well as the clinical specialty, of the involved experts. Most of the faculty comes from high-income countries and were engaged in high-volume hospitals with specialized hepatobiliary surgery units. It is therefore evident that the clinical experience and available resources of the aforementioned units may not be directly transferable to low- or medium-volume surgical units or to healthcare settings characterized by resource constraints. Consequently, the implementation of any recommendation outlined in this consensus statement is contingent upon the specific requirements, experience, and available resources of the respective institutions or countries. The consensus threshold of 70% allows the potential inclusion of statements with limited evidence. Further limitations arise from the methodology applied. Incorporating a modified Delphi approach and expert opinions carries some risk of bias in the interpretation of the literature review, especially as members of the consensus group were involved in many publications retrieved in the literature search. Involvement of a neutral validation committee and full transparency through declaration of conflict of interest for each co-author addressed this potential limitation. Finally, long-term outcome data are sparse, particularly in relation to late postoperative complications, underscoring the need for prospective, multicentre studies to validate and refine these recommendations. Clinicians are encouraged to adapt these consensus recommendations according to institutional resources, local expertise, and patient populations. The recommendations are designed to align with other principles, such as Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) and EASL\u2013EASD\u2013EASO Clinical Practice Guidelines. They are also implementable within both academic and community practice environments. Given the level of available evidence, the current rate of innovation in perioperative management of surgical patients, including those undergoing liver surgery, and the ongoing trials, the authors estimate that these recommendations will at least remain relevant for approximately 5 years. To strengthen future versions of these recommendations and resolve ongoing uncertainties, several evidence gaps on perioperative management of patients undergoing liver resections have been identified throughout this consensus development process. These clinically relevant areas represent future research topics that could be addressed in a common, multicentric effort with the aim to improve clinical outcomes and standardize the perioperative management of patients undergoing complex liver resections. Equally, some topics were identified where additional research may yield limited clinical benefit and that the authors define as \u2018futile\u2019 since enough good evidence has been achieved and no future efforts should be invested in those areas (). The present consensus paper has been developed for the purpose of supporting clinicians in the delivery of safe, evidence-informed, and standardized care across the perioperative course of liver resection. The text addresses fundamental clinical dilemmas, with the objective of providing clear guidance, thus making it a practical reference for surgical and multidisciplinary teams. It is imperative that ongoing research collaboration, implementation monitoring, and periodic updates are maintained to ensure the continued relevance of the programme and to enhance the outcomes for patients undergoing liver resection.\n", "type": "Document"}

A novel coronavirus was identified on 12 January 2020 and called the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV); on 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially indicated this viral disease, which affects mostly the lower respiratory tract and manifests as pneumonia in humans, as COVID-19. COVID-19 has rapidly spread and the WHO declared it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern with a risk assessment of very high at a global level. Since the COVID-19 pandemic has occurred, nations showed their unpreparedness to deal with a mass casualty incident of this proportion and severity: hospital leadership and individual providers faced difficult decisions about how to conserve critical resources, such as hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) beds, respirators, transfusion capacity, and personal protective equipment (PPE) that are vital for protecting patients and staff from unnecessary exposure and intra-hospital transmission. It resulted in high mortality rate of infected patients, in particular of fragile patients such as people with multiple chronic comorbidities and polypharmacy, and an unacceptable number of infected healthcare workers and deaths. Since the early phase of the pandemic, surgical theatres were converted into additional ICUs to support critically ill patients and non-urgent, non-cancer surgical procedures were cancelled or postponed until a later date; all nurses and medical staff including residents were reallocated in COVID units. In this apocalyptic scenario, the emergency surgeons accepted their crucial role in the management of infected and non infected patients and the need to work safely to limit the spread of the virus in healthcare facilities and to decrease morbidity and mortality rate, which may result from delay diagnosis and treatment of surgical patients.

There is not yet recommendation about the routinely testing for COVID-19 disease of patients admitted in the ED with acute abdominal pain. Since the COVID-19 infection outbreak, the WHO and CDC [ .In clinical practice, this recommendation turned out rapidly in a large number of infected healthcare workers and a high risk of environmental contamination, worsening the problem of limited resources in terms of PPE availability, hospital beds shortage in ICU and overloaded healthcare personnel. At ED admission, a patient is defined \u201csuspected\u201d for COVID-19 infection if: He presents with fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease and a history of travel to or residence in a country area or territory reporting local transmission of COVID-19 disease during the14 days prior to symptom onset;He presents with any acute respiratory illness, having been in contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case in the last 14 days prior onset of symptoms;He presents with severe respiratory infection, with no other etiology that fully explains the clinical presentation, requiring hospitalization. Many authors reported that the most common symptoms in patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection are fever > 38.5 \u00b0C, breathing difficulties and dry cough, diarrhoea and vomiting are rare [ Characteristic laboratory findings in COVID-19 pneumonia are leucopenia and lymphopenia. The level of aspartate aminotransferase is often elevated. Infected patients could present with myocarditis and an increased level of hypersensitive troponin I [d-dimers [ Nevertheless, several patients, even with a COVID-19 infection, do not complain of these symptoms and require admission in a surgical ward for early management of an acute abdomen. According to the policy of infection control, during this pandemic, COVID-19 disease diagnosis should be prioritized in case of patients admitted for a surgical intra-abdominal disease to comply with the objectives of: Minimizing the exposure in operating room (OR);Decreasing the risk of environmental contamination;Minimizing the occupation of the OR;Reducing the hospital stay of patients submitted to surgery. Suspected clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 is confirmed through [The COVID-19 RT-PCR test that provides nucleic acid detection in the nasal and throat swab sampling or other respiratory tract samplings by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and further confirmed by high-throughput sequencing [The chest imaging that includes chest radiograph, computed tomography (CT) scan or lungs ultrasound (US). The application of high-throughput sequencing technology in clinical diagnosis is limited because of its equipment dependency and high cost; consequently, the RT-PCR test is the most common, effective and straightforward method for detecting pathogenic viruses in respiratory secretions. The RT-PCR method heavily relies on the presence of viral genome in sufficient amounts at the site of sample collection that can be amplified. If the swab test result is positive, it is recommended that the test is repeated for confirmation [ To limit the number of false-negative patients, the WHO has suggested collecting specimens from both the upper respiratory tract (nasal- and oropharyngeal samples) and lower respiratory tract such as expectorated sputum, endotracheal aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) [ COVID-19 patients have different virus loads or positive rates in different stages of the disease and in different parts of the body. A high viral load can be detected in the early stage of the disease by pharyngeal swab, and detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA is better in nasopharynx samples than the oropharynx. In the middle stage, the viral load of the lower respiratory tract will be significantly higher than that of the upper respiratory tract. According to the existing evidence, the positive rate from high to low is bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, sputum, nasal swab, fibrobronchoscope brush biopsy, pharyngeal swab and faeces. The positive rate of nasal swabs is close to that of sputum. It is important to note that with the recovery of the disease, the positive rate of oropharyngeal swabs in mild patients declines the fastest, and in the later course of the disease, positive results of anal swabs are more than that of pharyngeal swabs. The viral nucleic acids in the stool of the recovered patients turn to negative later than the oropharyngeal swabs [ Furthermore, missing the time-window of viral replication can increase false-negative patients. At present, the specificity of RT-PCR viral swab for COVID-19 is thought to be high while the sensitivity is likely < 90%. The detection of SARS-CoV2 using RT-PCR can achieve a sensitivity of 50\u201379%, depending on the protocol used, the sample type and the number of clinical specimens collected [ Therefore, while testing can miss COVID-19-infected patients as a result of the relatively poor sensitivity of the PCR viral swab, most of these false-negative patients will have a clinical picture or radiological chest feature that is consistent with the SARS-CoV-2 infection and will be presumed to have the diagnosis even with a negative swab result. This group of patients represents the uncertain COVID-19 patients to consider in the risk of in-hospital transmission of the virus. The chest CT examination has demonstrated a high sensitivity in the initial diagnosis of the novel coronavirus pneumonia and to evaluate the severity of the infection [ Yoon et al. [ Another study showed that pleural effusion is present in about 32% [ Shi et al. [ Multiple patchy ground-glass consolidation (in severe pneumonia), crazy-paving pattern, interlobular thickening, adjacent pleura thickening and linear opacities in bilateral multiple lobular with periphery distribution are typical chest CT imaging features of the COVID-19 pneumonia [ A recent study [p < .001) in detecting nCoV-19 infection because of the low efficiency of viral RT-PCR test. Consequently, in screening of surgical patients, chest CT could be useful in decreasing the number of false-negative swab patients and to early individuate patients with uncertain COVID-19 infection who need to be isolated from negative patients. On the other side, Bernheim et al. [ In the lack of recommendations about the screening of surgical patients for COVID-19 infection admitted in the ED with acute abdomen, many international societies of surgeons suggested to perform a swab test at admission and to complete the abdomen CT scan with a chest scanning for all patients. By the time, it could not be viable because of the increasing number of symptomatic patients needing for a chest CT to assess the severity of the COVID-19 pneumonia and the overwhelmed ED. Furthermore isolation and barrier procedures were necessary in the radiology department to protect both the high exposed staff and other patients in the hospital. Consequently, radiology departments were re-organized in clean and contaminated areas and infection control measures had been implemented including providing adequate standard protective equipment, training staff, and instituting proper emergency plan to prevent intradepartmental spreading of infection such as waiting a safe period for air exchange and decontamination of the room and surfaces in the radiology department, increasing timing for a radiological examination [ Even if an abdominal CT scan is always performed in acute abdomen with clinical and biological signs of gravity, adding a chest CT could require more occupational time of the radiological room, a different acquisition protocol of images for the radiologist and an environmental risk of dissemination of the virus due to the inspiration and expiration requested to the patient during examination. Furthermore, according to available evidence, CT scan used as a screening tool has some shortcomings, such as the overlap of imaging findings with other respiratory diseases and at very early stage of infection, the absence of any abnormalities [ Other radiological imaging techniques, such as chest X-ray (CXR) and lung US, may be advocated in the screening of surgical patients, both to decrease the number of chest TC and in case of contraindication or unavailability of CT, to confirm the COVID-19 pneumonia. Common CXR findings are bilateral interstitial pattern/ground-glass opacities, with isolated focal infiltrate making the diagnosis less likely. In clinical practice, the CXR may be normal early in the disease course, so a normal x-ray does not rule out the diagnosis, exactly like a chest CT scan. With the purpose to describe the time course and severity of the CXR findings of COVID-19 pneumonia and correlate radiological findings with RT-PCR testing for SARS-Cov-2 nucleic acid, a retrospective study was carried out in a cohort of 64 COVID-19 patients and the CXR demonstrated lower sensitivity of 69% [95% CI: 56\u201380%], compared with 91% [95% CI: 81\u201396%] (p = 0.009) for initial RT-qPCR. In this study, CXR abnormalities preceded positive RT-PCR in only 6/64 (9%) patients; moreover, common CXR findings mirror those described for CT that are bilateral, peripheral, consolidation and/or ground-glass opacities. The severity of CXR findings peaked at 10\u201312 days from the date of symptom onset [ The lung point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) is reported to be useful in confirming clinical suspicion of COVID 19 infection in patients who showed negative RT-qPCR. Vetrugno and Coll [ Buonsenso et al. [ The early US pulmonary manifestations of COVID-19 pneumonia are patchy distribution of interstitial artefactual signs (single and/or confluent vertical artefacts and small white lung regions) that will extend these patterns to multiple areas of the lung surface. The further evolution is represented by the appearance, still patchy, of small subpleural consolidations with associated areas of white lung. The evolution in consolidations, especially in a gravitational position, with or without air bronchograms, and their increasing extension along the lung surface indicate the evolution toward the phase of respiratory insufficiency that requires invasive ventilatory support [ Soldati et al. [The use of a convex or linear transducers. The latter are preferable to study the detail of the pleural and subpleural alterations.The use of a single\u2013focal point modality (no multi-focusing), and set the focal point on the pleural line.Preferably, US scans need to be intercostal (not orthogonal to the ribs) to cover the widest surface possible with a single scan. Ideally, 16 areas, if it is possible, should be evaluated: anterior mid-clavicular (apical, medial, and basal), right and left; posterior para-spinal (apical, medial, and basal), right and left; and lateral axillary (apical and basal), medial right and left, to study the extent of the lungs surface affected. Advantages from the use of lung US as first radiological diagnostic investigation in suspected COVID-19 patients are [US portability and bed-side evaluation that could decrease the virus exposure of healthcare personnel and environmental contamination derived from moving the patient to the radiology unitEasier sterilization of the device due to smaller surface areasHigher sensitivity (80%) than CXR (no more than 60%) to discriminate a bacterial pneumonia from a non-bacterial infectionUS radiation freeUS instrument costs Lung POCUS limitations can be: The difficulty to detect a centrally located consolidation from bacterial superinfection;The inability to discern the chronicity of a lesion, limiting its power of early COVID19 diagnosis in the population with preexisting pulmonary conditions. Given the limits of the currently used nucleic acid detection and CT scan for the diagnosis of COVID-19 used as screening tools, point-of-care test (POCT) of IgM/IgG and ELISA kits for SARS-CoV-2 have been developed to help in the detection of infected patients in the emergency setting. In accordance with other acute viral infections, the antibody profile against SARS-CoV-2 has a typical pattern of IgM and IgG production. The SARS-specific IgM antibodies disappear at the end of week 12, while the IgG antibody can last for a long time [ Li et al. [ Moreover, the IgM-IgG combined assay was demonstrated to have better utility and sensitivity compared with a single IgM or IgG test. On the other hand, controversial data are reported about the use of IgM/IgG rapid test in the triage of patients admitted to the ED. Li et al. [ Focusing on acute patients, Cassaniti et al.

Generally, in very urgent cases, RT-PCR test can be obtained in 4\u20136 h; in other cases, test can be obtained in 48 h. This is according to the availability and contraindications, if they are present, to performing radiological imaging, chest CT scan, or lung US, if emergency physician or surgeon is skilled to perform it, or CXR can help in confirming the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia in surgical patients requiring immediate surgical procedure, showing pathognomonic features. During this pandemic, the decision of operating or delaying the surgical procedure depends on the emergency surgeon\u2019s evaluation. If an urgent surgical procedure is necessary (life-threatening complication, high-risk patients, haemodynamic compromise, or shock), the emergency surgeon should check promptly the availability of a dedicated operating room with functional and suitable human and technical resources for COVID-19 and negative patients. Several authors [ Many international societies of surgeons recommended rescheduling non-urgent surgeries but elective non-urgent surgery does not always mean optional surgery. Delaying some surgical procedures could become very harmful because the progression of the underlying abdominal disease that can lead to life-threatening complications. Focusing on emergency setting, early clinical diagnosis, adequate source control to stop ongoing contamination, appropriate antimicrobial therapy and prompt resuscitation in critically ill patients are the cornerstones in the management of intra-abdominal infections. Timing of surgical intervention is critical for outcomes of patients diagnosed with surgical emergencies. Under this period of limited access to hospital resources, the triage of the patients is fundamental to assess the severity of the intra-abdominal disease underlying the acute abdominal pain. Emergency surgeons have to decide for a non operative (NOM) or operative management of a surgical disease, such as it is recommended in international guidelines. The haemodynamic stability or instability after adequate resuscitative maneuvers remains the main tool to risk-stratify patients for immediate surgery or not. Furthermore, general, or more specific, clinical scores (such as for example the American Society of Anaesthesiologists\u2019 (ASA) score, Alvarado\u2019s score in case of acute appendicitis, SOFA for sepsis), the age of the patient and the presence of comorbidities, such as obesity, diabetes and COPD, can assist the emergency surgeon\u2019s decision making process, associated with clinical (signs of localized or generalized peritonitis at abdominal examination) and biological (inflammatory biomarkers such as C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, lactates) parameters. The WSES [ In this COVID-19 pandemic, these criteria could guide the acute surgical teams to properly tag each patient to the timing of surgery. Since now, the TACS classification is the only available tool to risk-stratify patients presenting with an emergency disease. The validity of the TACS classification system was evaluated in a tertiary public hospital of a developing country, and data showed that TACS rating improves time for surgeries classified as yellow (ideal time to surgery within 6 h) [ Some authors decided to develop a more functional and robust system six-level classification, the Non-Elective Surgery Triage (NEST), allowing prioritization based on physiologic state and disease process, but no data are available about its application [", "type": "Document"}

The main objective of the ES is not to delay surgery to decrease morbidity and mortality rates in patients in whom a surgical procedure is mandatory. Consequently, triage of the infected patients with TACS classification remains the cornerstone of the management of intra-abdominal surgical diseases. The assessment of the severity of the surgical disease and of the viral pneumonia enables ES to decide on the management of the patient, complying with international guidelines. On the assessment of the severity of the COVID-19 pneumonia, patients can be classified in [Patients with mild illness: this group of patients does not need ventilatory support or admission in ICU.Patients presenting with moderate viral pneumonia: they could require non-invasive ventilatory support.Patients with severe pneumonia: this is a group of critically ill patients that could present with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and need to be admitted in the ICU to receive ventilatory support or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). In the initial evaluation of a patient presenting with acute abdomen, the haemodynamic status remains the main tool to risk-stratify patients in need of immediate surgery. Then, if the intra-abdominal infection is uncomplicated (i.e. involving the organ and not the peritoneum), NOM could be a valid option, to be considered on a case-by-case basis, according to WSES guidelines [ In case of NOM, it is crucial to plan close clinical and radiological surveillance at 12\u201324-h intervals from the beginning of the intravenous antibiotic therapy until the situation is under control. If the patient presents with persistent abdominal pain, fever or signs of shock, surgical treatment cannot be postponed. Let us critically review the management of the most common surgical diseases, on the basis of the currently evidence. In case of diagnosis of acute appendicitis, the \u201cgold standard\u201d treatment is laparoscopic appendectomy in all patients. In this specific scenario, caution might be taken in the choice of the laparoscopic approach because of concerns about the presence of the virus in the pneumoperitoneum, if it is not possible to decrease the risk of dissemination of the virus in OR. However, NOM with antibiotic therapy has proven to be successful in uncomplicated appendicitis. The Jerusalem WSES guidelines and its 2020 update [ Similarly, under COVID-19 pandemic, patients presenting complicated appendicitis with a well-defined abscess in the right iliac fossa can be managed with percutaneous drainage, if it is available, associated with IV antibiotics. Patients with evidence of perforation may be managed with percutaneous drainage or operation based on patient condition, or if unfit for surgery. Patients who fail NOM should proceed to surgery expeditiously [ In case of diagnosis of acute cholecystitis, the laparoscopic cholecystectomy remains the treatment of choice [ The objectives of a PC are to decompress the gallbladder through a drainage left in place and to obtain cultures from the bile for appropriate antibiotic therapy. Actually, the 2016 WSES guidelines did not recommend it as an alternative to LC except in the most unfit patients due to the significantly higher mortality rate. The recent CHOCHOLATE trial confirmed that finding and was interrupted due to the poor results in the PC group [ In case of diagnosis of (jejunal or colonic) acute diverticulitis (AD) [ Patients presenting with Hinchey class I and II diverticulitis should be managed with percutaneous drainage in addition to antimicrobial therapy if a large (> 4 cm) abscess is visualized on CT scan. If percutaneous drainage is not available, the patient could be managed with antibiotics but surgery should be considered if there are signs of sepsis or shock. Patients who fail NOM should be expedited for surgery. Patients with pneumoperitoneum (free air distant to the sigmoid) and peritonitis should be considered for surgery. In this scenario, the surgical options are: Hartmann\u2019s procedure (HP) for managing diffuse peritonitis in critically ill patients and in selected patients with multiple comorbidities;Primary resection with anastomosis with or without a diverting stoma in clinically stable patients with no major comorbidities. Emergency laparoscopic sigmoidectomy should be avoided, especially if very long operative duration is expected. In the presence of uncomplicated jejunal diverticulitis, NOM with IV antibiotics could be an effective therapeutic option, if patient does not present signs of haemodynamic compromise. If jejunal diverticulitis is complicated by an abscess, the radiological drainage of the intra-abdominal collection could be a valid choice and at the same time the cultural analysis of the liquid can give useful information to adapt antimicrobial treatment. Patients who fail NOM have to be operated without delaying surgery. Intestinal resection with anastomosis is the best surgical option in stable patients. If patients present with signs of shock, haemodynamic instability and generalized faecal peritonitis, to avoid poor outcomes, intestinal resection with stoma creation is an option to take in consideration to minimize the occupational time of the OR. In case of diagnosis of colon obstruction or perforation [ Generally, WSES recommends reserving the loop colostomy for patients with unresectable tumors or too unfit for major surgery or even general anaesthesia. Colonic stent placement could have a role, but endoscopy can promote the spreading of the virus; consequently, WSES suggests to consider it in COVID 19 patients only if unfit for surgery and general anaesthesia [ Colonic resection and primary anastomosis, with or without loop ileostomy, should be the preferred option for uncomplicated malignant left-sided large bowel obstruction. However, it may increase operative time, with a high risk of viral exposure. Patients with high surgical risk would be better managed with HP. In the absence of major caecal distension, bowel ischaemia or synchronous patent right colonic cancer, total colectomy should not be undertaken. In the case of obstructive right-sided colon cancer, right colectomy with primary anastomosis is the preferred option. An end ileostomy with colonic fistula represents a valid alternative when a primary anastomosis is deemed too hazardous. For unresectable right-sided colon cancer, a side-to-side anastomosis ileotransverse internal bypass or a loop ileostomy could be performed. In case of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO) [ In case of intestinal occlusion in incarcerated abdominal hernia [ In patients presenting with perforated peptic ulcer (PPU) [ In patients with significant pneumoperitoneum or extraluminal contrast extravasation or signs of peritonitis, immediate surgery is mandatory and the laparoscopic approach is usually the first choice. During COVID-19 pandemic, if appropriate laparoscopic skills to minimize the occupational time of the OR and general anaesthesia, and in the absence of the equipment to perform a safe laparoscopy, the open approach is recommended, above all in unstable patient.

The surgical procedure has to be organized according to the protocol for infection in-hospital control. In evaluating the appropriate surgical technique, concerns have been expressed about the use of the laparoscopic approach. According to available data, SARS-CoV-2 is presumed to spread primarily via respiratory droplets and aerosols and close contact. Human coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS coronavirus, or endemic human coronaviruses can persist on inanimate surfaces such as metal, glass or plastic for up to 9 days [ In a brief report, Wang and Du [ Van Doremalen et al. have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 is more stable in aerosols and on various surfaces (plastic and stainless steel) under experimental conditions than SARS-CoV-1 and that it can remain viable and infectious in aerosols for hours and on surfaces, for days (depending on the inoculum shed) [ Three mechanisms have been described for the production of smaller sized respiratory particles (aerosols) that, if inhaled, can deposit in the distal airways and include laryngeal activity such as talking and coughing, high velocity gas flow, and cyclical opening and closure of terminal airways. Sneezing and coughing are effective aerosol generators, but all forms of expiration produce particles across a range of sizes. The 5-\u03bcm diameter threshold is used to differentiate droplet from airborne [ Potential aerosol-generating procedures (AGP), as defined by the WHO [ AGP are considered responsible of the SARS-CoV-2 transmission among healthcare workers (HCW). Tran et al. [ For Wilson et al., there is no proven relation between any AGP with airborne viral content with the exception of bronchoscopy and suctioning and they suggest that several AGP may result in less SARS-CoV 2 aerosolization than a dyspnoeic and coughing patient [ During surgery, aerosolization can result from dissection with electrosurgical instruments, as the heat of such devices results in a plume of surgical smoke, in either open or laparoscopic approach. Since COVID-19 outbreak, many authors suggested great care when carrying out a laparoscopic procedure in surgical patients with COVID-19, on the basis of a theoretical risk of occupational exposure and infection of the operating theatre staff, although to our knowledge, there has been still no study that has firmly confirmed the presence of the virus in theatre during laparoscopic procedures or in the artificial pneumoperitoneum [ Recently, the PCR test was used to confirm the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 in the peritoneal fluid in a case report [ Instead, there are studies that have demonstrated that electrosurgical devices can produce aerosolized bacteria and viruses including human immunodeficiency virus, human papillomavirus and hepatitis virus with a number of studies demonstrating a risk of oral papillomatosis due to occupational exposure during open surgery [ The aerosolization risk in laparoscopy is still unclear. A study by Giannella and colleagues reported traces of anaesthetic sevoflurane being also found, showing an unknown mechanism of passage between the lungs and the abdominal cavity [ At early stage of this pandemic, in the lack of strong evidence, many international societies were nearly to prohibit laparoscopy, except in ultra-selected cases. More carefully, several authors [ For some authors, during this crisis, a laparoscopic approach should be avoided because it could be associated with longer operative time (and therefore increased risk of exposure and occupational time of OR), especially in an emergency setting [ Considering available evidence since now, both laparoscopic and open approach could be considered AGP and could contribute to the environmental contamination and the virus exposure of the HCW. Taking in consideration patient safety and infection prevention, on a case-by-case evaluation, the emergency surgeon has to select the appropriate surgical technique for that patient in that hospital. The availability of the adapted surgical equipment, all PPE and trained HCWs are essential to perform a safe surgical procedure [ Generally, a number of strategies are employed in the hospital and in the operating rooms to minimize exposure to the virus and to decrease the risk of environmental contamination including negative-pressure ventilation (preventing cross-contamination between rooms), minimizing time and exposure during intubation, using surgical masks such as FFP2 (minimum) or FFP3, as well as smoke evacuation systems in case of a laparoscopic approach and a suction system to limit the exposure to surgical smoke while performing a laparotomy. According to these data, we suggest, both in laparoscopic and in laparotomy, to carefully balance the risk of potential viral exposure and transmission in that particular situation and the clinical benefits of a minimally invasive approach or a laparotomy for that patient. All mandatory precautions to perform a safe surgical procedure in a COVID-19 patient (confirmed or uncertain) are listed in the Table Having reviewed the available literature on COVID-19, we concur that when considering the laparoscopic approach in an emergency, every effort should be made to limit the leakage of gas, but there seems no reason to abandon laparoscopic surgery over open surgery [ We recommend making modifications to surgical practice such as the use of smoke evacuation/suction and minimizing energy device/electrocautery use among other measures to minimize operative staff exposure to aerosolized particles. Contraindications to laparoscopy are not evidence-based since aerosolization is produced during both open and laparoscopic surgical procedures. However, personal protective equipment is the key for prevention [ In the lack of PPE and general measures to prepare the operating theatre, such as summarized in the Table A strategy for damage control surgery may have a role in haemodynamically compromised patients [", "type": "Document"}

In particular, critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 showed a high risk to present thromboembolic events. Zhang et al. reported significant aberrant coagulation changes in critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU: fibrinolytic degradation products (d-dimer and fibrinogen degradation products) were significant above normal range in almost all patients; the levels of fibrinogen and factor VIII coagulant activity were above normal range in the majority of patients; the natural anticoagulant activities were mildly lower. Nearly half of patients developed thrombotic events after admission to ICU. These findings implied that sustained hypercoagulable status and activation of coagulation system are hallmarks of critically ill COVID-19 and provided a strong evidence to support anticoagulation therapy in these patients [ Cui et al. [d-dimer that could be considered a good index for identifying high-risk groups of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in COVID-19 patients. Another observational study from the Netherlands examined the incidence of both venous and arterial thromboembolic events in 184 ICU SARS-CoV-2 patients. They observed 25 pulmonary embolism, and 3 ischemic strokes, and reported that VTE occurred in 27% of patients [95% CI: 17\u201337%] and arterial thrombotic events in 3.7% [95% CI: 0\u20138.2%]. The acute pulmonary embolism was the most frequent thrombotic complication (n = 25, 81%). Age and coagulopathy were identified such as independent predictors of thrombotic complications [ These rates are very high when compared to a recent RCT conducted on ICU (no COVID) patients that reported the incidence of VTE to be 9.4% [d-dimer increased from mild to significant, along with prolonged prothrombin time and gradual decrease of fibrinogen and platelet [d-dimer and fibrin degradation product (FDP) levels, longer prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time compared to survivors on admission (P < .05); 71.4% of non-survivors and 0.6% survivors met the criteria of disseminated intravascular coagulation during their hospital stay. It has been proven that the coagulation system can be activated by a variety of different viruses [ While many pro-inflammatory cytokines trigger the coagulation system, Zhou and colleagues [d-dimer; IL-6 levels appeared to increase only 13 days after disease onset, whereas d-dimer levels were already 10-fold increased by that time. This observation suggests that the very high d-dimer levels observed in COVID-19 patients are not only secondary to systemic inflammation, but also reflect true thrombotic disease, possibly induced by cellular activation that is triggered by the virus. Whether the coagulation cascade is directly activated by the virus or whether this is the result of local or systemic inflammation is not completely understood, anyway, vascular endothelial damage in both small- and mid-sized pulmonary vessels was noted together with disseminated intravascular coagulation, deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism resulting in pulmonary infarction in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 [ Tang et al. [P = 0.029), but not among the 352 patients with a SIC score, which includes prothrombin time, platelet count and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA), < 4 (29% vs 23%; P = 0.42). The WHO interim guidance statement recommends prophylactic daily LMWHs, or twice daily subcutaneous unfractionated heparin (UFH) [ If pharmacological prophylaxis is contraindicated, mechanical VTE prophylaxis (intermittent pneumatic compression) should be considered in immobilized patients [ The risk of VTE is increased in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Alterations in pharmacokinetics in this group of patients may necessitate anticoagulation dose adjustment, due to factors relating to absorption, metabolism and renal (or hepatic) elimination of these drugs in the setting of potential organ dysfunction. The anti-thrombotic prophylaxis showed high rate of failure above all in COVID-19 patients admitted in ICU when standard LMWH or UFH doses are used. This is due to a heparin resistance with UFH or sub-optimal anti-Xa peak with LMWH that seems to be common in COVID-19 intensive care unit patients who received therapeutic anticoagulation. Consequently, it is important to measure anti-Xa levels for patients on therapeutic LMWH to ensure adequate dosing and continue with careful monitoring for those on UFH [", "type": "Document"}

An Italian epidemiological study showed that critically ill patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to ICUs are above all older men (n = 786; age \u2265 64 years) and that the majority of these patients requires mechanical ventilation and high levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). The mortality rate for this group of patients is 26% in this study [ Therefore, this group of critically ill patients is associated with a high risk of perioperative mortality and demands a multidisciplinary approach and a trained postoperative management (anesthesiologist, infection disease physician, surgeon, cardiologist, nephrologist). Patients admitted to the hospital with acute surgical pathologies, requiring surgeon\u2019s evaluation and managing. After diagnostic ED work-up (RT-PCR, chest and abdominal CT or abdominal CT and CXR or lungs US), they could be divided in confirmed COVID-19 patients, suspected/uncertain for SARS-CoV-2 infection without confirmed diagnosis patients, and negative patients. The group of suspected/uncertain patients needs to be isolated until RT-PCR swab test result is available, according to intra-hospital infection control policy. Most common known COVID-19 infection complications are ARDS, arrhythmia, shock, acute cardiac injury, secondary infection, acute kidney injury and death which may occur in severe cases. Currently, the data on the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 infection undergoing surgeries are rare. Lei et al. [ Of the 34 operative patients, the median age was 55 years (IQR, 43\u201363), and 20 (58.8%) patients were women. All patients developed COVID-19 pneumonia shortly after surgery with abnormal findings on chest CT scans. Common symptoms included fever (31 [91.2%]), fatigue (25 [73.5%]) and dry cough (18 [52.9%]). Fifteen (44.1%) patients required admission to ICU during disease progression, and 7 patients (20.5%) died after admission to ICU. Compared with patients not requiring ICU admission, ICU patients were older, more likely to have underlying comorbidities, underwent more difficult surgeries, and more severe laboratory abnormalities (e.g. hyperleukocytemia, lymphopenia). The most common complications in non-survivors patients included ARDS, shock, arrhythmia and acute cardiac injury. This retrospective study showed that surgery can have a negative impact on COVID-19 patients even if they are asymptomatic, with a mortality rate of 20.5% and the potentially needing for postoperative ICU care [ Another retrospective study carried out in a single thoracic department, enrolling 25 COVID-19 patients reported similar data showing that COVID-19 is associated with poor prognosis for patients undergoing surgery, especially for those with chronic diseases [ According to available data, coronavirus infection appears to be a complex systemic disease involving different organs. This lays on that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Hammings et al. investigated the immuno-localization of ACE2 protein and reported that it is abundantly present in humans in the epithelia of the lung and small intestine including the duodenum, jejunum and ileum, but not in the colon. Furthermore, ACE2 is present in arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells of various human organs such as oral and nasal mucosa, nasopharynx, lung, stomach, small intestine, colon, skin, lymph nodes, thymus, bone marrow, spleen, liver, kidney and brain. Moreover, ACE2 mRNA was found in many tissues and it is highly expressed in renal, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal tissues. The binding of SARS-CoV-2 on ACE2 causes an elevated expression of ACE2, which can lead to damages primarily on alveolar cells and lately on other organs. Damages to alveolar cells can, in turn, trigger a series of systemic reactions with the secretion of various pro-inflammatory mediators that may play important roles in the pathophysiology of complications [ Several studies reported higher in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19 infection presenting abnormal kidney function, diabetes and cardiac injury [ Therefore, COVID-19 patients presenting already with comorbidities such as diabetes, renal abnormalities (e.g. haematuria, proteinuria, acute kidney injury), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and chronic cardiovascular disorders are at risk for presenting severe coronavirus disease as well as poor outcome after surgery. Moreover, the duration of the surgical procedure and general anaesthesia can increase the risk of postoperative infections. Specific pharmacological treatment for COVID-19 is not available [ In this lack, in the early phase of the pandemic, many centres decided to use empirical antiviral therapy with darunavir or lopinavir in combination with ritonavir and oseltamivir and hydroxychloroquine on the basis of early promising results in terms of survival in critical COVID-19 patients reported in several studies. In an open-label clinical study that showed some limitations in the methodology, Gautret et al. [ Azithromycin is a broad-spectrum macrolide antibiotic with a long half-life and a large volume of distribution; it is primarily used for the treatment of respiratory, enteric and genitourinary bacterial infections. In addition it has shown to be active in vitro against Zika and Ebola viruses [ .In the early phase of this pandemic, lopinavir/ritonavir were administered in severe coronavirus disease cases, in association with other medical treatment. Cao et al. [ While in healthy, young patients diagnosed with COVID-19 the combination of these drugs are well tolerated with mild side effects, in the elderly patients presenting age-related comorbidities that result in complex polypharmacy, the risk of toxicity with lethal complications is increased. Furthermore, physiological changes related to ageing may affect both pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics thereby putting elderly patients at risk of inappropriate prescribing and adverse drug reactions [ Both lopinavir/ritonavir and chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are known to cause QT prolongation and torsades de pointes. In particular, long-term chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine use may increase depolarization length duration and Purkinje fiber refractory period, ultimately leading to atrioventricular nodal and/or His system malfunction and arrhythmia. QT prolongation in individual medical therapy is not always predictable; dose adjustments and/or additional monitoring with electrocardiograms may be appropriate in some cases [ COVID-19 patients treated with these drugs need a careful clinical and biological multidisciplinary surveillance. Currently, there are no data about the use of antimicrobial in COVID-19 patients. Several studies [Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus being the most frequently reported pathogens. The exact incidence of bacterial superinfection in COVID-19 is unknown. It was reported that the most common co-infections in COVID-19 patients were rhinovirus/enterovirus (6.9%), respiratory syncytial virus (5.2%) and non\u2013SARS-CoV-2 Coronaviridae (4.3%), isolated in the respiratory tract [ Consequently, taking into consideration the risk potential for co-infections of the respiratory tract, confirmed COVID-19 patients were often administered with antibiotics even if there is no any confirmation of the co-infections. This could contribute in selecting microbes, increasing the alarming problem of antimicrobial resistance, above all in critical ill patients, in mechanical ventilatory support. If antimicrobial treatment is considered, a beta-lactam providing coverage for S. pneumoniae \u00b1 methicillin-susceptible S. aureus should be the first option (e.g. amoxicillin + clavulanic acid or third-generation cephalosporins). Once-a-day administration (where applicable) or continuous administration of beta-lactam antibiotics should be considered to decrease the use of personal protective equipment which may be in short supply in many places. Macrolides and quinolones should be avoided because of their cardiac side effects, considering that other agents associated with cardiac side effects such as hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir are used in many places notwithstanding the limited evidence for their efficacy and impact on antimicrobial resistance [ The administration of antibiotics in surgical confirmed COVID-19 patients, except azythromicin used in many empirical protocols but not still validated, should follow WSES recommendations for the management of intra-abdominal infections [ If there are no signs of persistent leukocytosis or fever, antimicrobial therapy for intra-abdominal infections should be shortened for patients demonstrating a positive response to treatment. The risk of fungal co-infection appears to be low [ Furthermore, in severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, high dose of corticosteroids are administered. The rationale for the use of corticosteroids is to decrease the host inflammatory responses in the lungs, which may lead to acute lung injury and ARDS. However, this benefit may be outweighed by adverse effects, including delayed viral clearance and increased risk of secondary infection. In patients taking corticosteroids (long-term use of corticosteroids or perioperative use of corticosteroids), the risk for anastomotic leakage is significantly increased, such as wound infection and wound dehiscence. It is known that corticosteroids impair wound healing by decreasing activation and infiltration of inflammatory cells. These inflammatory cells, macrophages and polymorph leucocytes, are essential in the first phase of wound healing. Additionally, corticosteroids inhibit the expression of growth factors and matrix proteins such as collagen synthesis. Other known complications of glucocorticoids include gastrointestinal bleeding, peptic ulcer perforation and sigmoid diverticular perforation [https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2021436). In the management of postoperative pain in COVID-19 patients, concerns were expressed about the administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Their use has been associated with gastrointestinal complications and cardiovascular and renal adverse effects. According to low-quality data, NSAIDs (ibuprofen/ketoprofen) have reported to play a role in decreasing host defence with serious infectious complications. In the lack of scientific evidences to establish a correlation between NSAIDS and the worsening of COVID-19 pneumonia, patients should be advised against any NSAID self-medication when COVID-19-like symptoms begins. NSAIDs should be used with extreme caution [", "type": "Document"}

In the early phase of the pandemic, to assure the management of infected and non infected surgical patients, hospitals were divided in dedicated HUB for overt COVID-19 patients, with limited surgical staff and ORs, for those infected patients requiring surgery, and COVID-free facilities for elective, emergency surgery and urgent oncological procedures in negative COVID-19 patients, with the aim of minimizing the risk of exposure to the virus and for better access and use of limited resources and PPE, but the progression of contagion has not allowed this for long time. Moreover, in the early phase of the COVID-19 surge, the availability of RT-PCR test was very limited and asymptomatic patients admitted in the ED were not tested for COVID-19 routinely, and this has contributed to the nosocomial spreading of the virus. The outcome of this practice was an increasing number of infected physicians and HCWs, warranting aggressive measures of protection (such as N95 masks, goggles or face mask and protective gowns) to ensure safety during this COVID-19 outbreak, which are often lacking. Current evidence suggest that even non-symptomatic infected patients can spread COVID-19 disease with high efficiency. This has implied to reconsider the indication of performing test for COVID-19 in all surgical patients to limit the contagion to HCWs and the in-hospital spreading of the virus [ In clinical practice, patients needing for a surgical procedure or undergone urgent surgery with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection require a multidisciplinary approach and management, and they need to be isolated from other negative surgical patients to decrease the in-hospital risk of virus transmission and environmental contamination. It is established that : 2019-nCoV can be transmitted by asymptomatic infectors;2019-nCoV is transmitted by droplets, fomites and closed contact;Faecal-oral and aerosol transmission is involved in the spreading of COVID-19 disease;Human coronaviruses can persist on inanimate surfaces such as metal, glass or plastic for up to 9 days. On this basis, confirmed COVID-19 patients need to be cared by a trained and skilled workforce with adequate PPEs (e.g. N95 masks, goggles, double gloves, face mask and protective gowns) to preserve negative surgical patients from contagion, because of the high risk to come in contact with droplets and biological fluids. After emergency surgery, patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia need to be re-admitted in COVID ICU for management and monitoring For stable asymptomatic or mild symptomatic COVID-19 patients, it would be better to create a surgical dedicated ward with the aim to avoid any contamination of negative patients, patients admitted for acute abdomen and patients waiting for a surgical procedure and to limit the in-hospital exposure to the virus to a dedicated and trained team. In the postoperative time, an overt COVID-19 patient who had undergone surgery could present with an ileostomy or a colostomy, with a nasogastric tube or intra-abdominal drainages to manage with risk of healthcare contamination and dissemination of the viral disease. Furthermore, asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic COVID-19 patients could present with a rapid progression of the infection to be promptly recognized, requiring ventilatory support and adequate monitoring. Patients selected for NOM have to be closely evaluated by the surgeon to decide for surgery if it is necessary. In the postoperative period, it is very important to carefully administer empirical treatment for COVID-19 infection when it is indicated, antibiotics and other drugs to avoid side effects, sometimes lethal.

Disease-free patients can be transferred to the regular surgical ward for their management. There is no evidence about the management of uncertain/suspected COVID-19 patients, presenting risk factors to present COVID-19 disease. Every patient undergoing surgery should be screened by the RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 infection before entering the operating room, even if he is asymptomatic, and he/she should be treated at first such as an infected patient, until suspected diagnosis is confirmed. A nasopharyngeal swab is usually the collection method used to obtain a specimen for testing. Nasopharyngeal specimens may miss some infections, and a deeper specimen may need to be obtained by bronchoscopy, which is a high-risk AGP. Alternatively, repeated testing can be used because over time, the likelihood of the SARS-CoV-2 being present in the nasopharynx increases. The use of serology to facilitate the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection when a nasopharyngeal swab specimen was collected inappropriately and the molecular assays were performed unsatisfactorily, can be taken in consideration, if it is available. The incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 reaches up to 14 days with a mean duration of 5.2 days; consequently, an initial negative result of the pharyngeal swab can turn into a positive result few days later [ Interpreting the result of a test for COVID-19 depends on two things: the accuracy of the test, and the pretest probability or estimated risk of disease before testing. A positive RT-PCR test for COVID-19 test has more weight than a negative test because of the test\u2019s high specificity but moderate sensitivity. A single negative COVID-19 test should not be used as a rule-out in patients with strongly suggestive symptoms [ Considering the high infectivity related to SARS-CoV-2, insufficient precaution in managing a false-negative patient could cause the contagion to nurses and surgeons. Consequently, if the suspected/uncertain COVID-19 patient needs to undergo immediate surgery, he has to be managed like a confirmed COVID-19; alternatively, the suspected/uncertain patient should be isolated to ensure the limiting of exposure and contagion. After surgery, if diagnosis is not yet confirmed or eliminated, the patient has to be kept in isolation in a single room with a negative pressure, until RT-PCR test, or serology, result is available. Postoperative rounds, medications and wound management should be performed under personal protection to avoid contact with secretions. Since surgical stress could increase the viral load and make the healthy carrier more infectious; daily assessment of body temperature as well as respiratory symptoms is mandatory for this group of patients: all postoperative fevers should be kept in serious consideration such as expression of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the pharyngeal swab test should be repeated several times unless a clinical explanation of the ongoing high temperature would be found. If patient was selected for NOM, he has to be isolated from the other negative surgical patients, for the same reasons explained above since infection is confirmed or eliminated.

According to the CDC recommendations [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/disposition-hospitalized-patients.html], the patient could be discharged to home if: Appropriate caregivers are available at home, in case of isolated elderly patientsThe patient can be isolated limiting the risk of exposure for the other household members (e.g. single room with good ventilation, face mask wear, reduced close contact with family members, separate meals, good hand sanitation, no outdoor activities)There are no household members who may be at increased risk of complications from COVID-19 infection (e.g. people > 65 years old, young children, pregnant women, people who are immunocompromised or who have chronic heart, lung or kidney conditions)All the household members are capable of adhering to recommended precautions to avoid the shedding of the virus until the risk of transmission is low. The decision to remove precautions is based on two general strategies: a test-based strategy that requires negative respiratory RT-PCR tests obtained after the resolution of symptoms and a symptom-based strategy that recommends keeping patients on contact precautions until a fixed period has elapsed from symptom recovery. The underlying assumption of the symptom-based strategy is that waiting for a fixed period of time is a surrogate for negative RT-PCR testing, which itself is a surrogate for the absence of shedding infectious virus. After hospital discharge, if there is a possibility that the patient is still infectious, clear advice should be given on how to avoid transmitting COVID-19 disease and all the confirmed and suspected COVID-19 patients should be further quarantined in designated COVID (+) hospitals, healthcare facilities or at home, keeping precautions to avoid infection transmission, followed up by RT-PCR tests, to decide to discontinue the isolation, even if the recovered is asymptomatic. COVID-19 patients should be kept in isolation at least until the 14 days have passed since the date of their first positive COVID-19 diagnostic test, as clinical criteria cannot be used to assess where these individuals are in the course of their illness [ Due to the convenience of operation and the acceptability of patients, the most commonly used specimens at discharge in practice are also oropharyngeal swabs, and sometimes, nasal swabs are collected at the same time. However, in the middle and later stages of the disease, the amount of virus remaining in the pharyngeal cells is small or very low in some patients and they can result (false) negative. If only the pharyngeal specimens are taken, the viral nucleic acid cannot be detected. Although alveolar lavage fluid is easier to detect viruses, due to its inconvenient operation and high risk of exposure, it is mainly used on critically ill patients who have been intubated [ This is consistent with prior literature [ It is important to note that with the recovery of the disease, the positive rate of oropharyngeal swabs in mild patients declines the fastest, and in the later course of the disease, positive results of anal swabs are more than that of pharyngeal swabs [ Furthermore, current data showed that several patients meeting criteria for hospital discharge could present positive RT-PCR test during the isolation period. The time from hospital discharge to positive checked RT-PCR after recovery was 5\u201313 days. All these patients continued to be asymptomatic and chest CT showed no changes from previous images [ These findings suggested that at least a proportion of recovered COVID-19 patients still may be virus carriers, that intermittent virus shedding might occur in recovered patients and that the number of PCR false-negative test patients at the discharge is not negligible. Serology can help in detecting the infection in suspected/uncertain/asymptomatic cases and in deciding for discontinuation of quarantine. Antibodies IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2 infection are usually produced in infected patients, and antibody IgG can persist a very long time. There are no data about the use of serology to follow recovered patients. An observational analysis of 150 patients and HCWs showed that the average time to transition from RT-PCR positive to negative was 24 days after symptom onset, and 10% of patients remained positive even 33 days after symptom onset [ Although there is no firm evidence indicating that these recovered patients would transmit the virus to others, after discharge, 4 weeks of further isolation with regular health monitoring (e.g. follow-up visits, phone calls, video-consultations) should be considered for COVID-19 patients, such as keeping all necessary precautions (face mask, reduced close contact) in order to protect family members and the community from infection and further spread of SARS-CoV-2.", "type": "Document"}

The physiological actions of endogenous GLP-1, and synthetic GLP-1RAs include inhibition of gastric emptying. This has peri-procedural implications due to the potential increased risk of retained gastric contents which may result in pulmonary aspiration. There is a need for local evidence-based guidelines to best manage patients on GLP-1RAs and dual GLP-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor co-agonists (GLP-1/GIPRAs) presenting for surgical and medical procedures requiring sedation or anaesthesia. A panel of experts was formed to consider the peri-procedural implications of GLP-1RA and GLP-1/GIPRA use and establish best practice recommendations based on the current evidence.We recommend that all patients should be asked about glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) and dual GLP-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor co-agonist (GLP-1/GIPRA) use prior to anaesthesia or sedation for surgical and endoscopic procedures and be informed of the benefits and risks. We also recommend that GLP-1RAs and GLP-1/GIPRAs be continued in the peri-procedural period. Preprocedural diet modification with a 24-h clear fluid diet, followed by standard 6-h fasting, should be recommended for all patients receiving GLP-1RAs or GLP-1/GIPRAs. In patients who have not completed or are unable to have a 24-h liquid diet, risk stratification using gastric ultrasound or minimally sedated gastroscopy to assess gastric contents is recommended, as is the use of intravenous erythromycin. We cannot currently recommend using the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms for risk stratification, nor can we recommend an adequate cessation period for GLP-1RAs and GLP-1/GIPRAs to ensure gastric emptying has returned to baseline levels. This clinical guideline, developed by multiple professional bodies, outlines current best practice recommendations for patients taking GLP-1RAs and combined GLP-1/GIPRAs who require general anaesthesia, sedation and/or endoscopic procedures. The guide provides a structure for Australian and New Zealand primary health practitioners, gastroenterologists, surgeons, endocrinologists, anaesthetists and perioperative physicians to support clinical decisions in these patients.", "type": "Document"}

In Australia, available GLP-1RAs include liraglutide (Victoza, Saxenda), dulaglutide (Trulicity) and semaglutide (Ozempic, Wegovy). Tirzepatide (Mounjaro) is the only GLP-1/GIPRA registered in Australia. It is estimated that 0.7% of Australians are currently accessing semaglutide, with predictions that almost one in 10 Australians will be on a GLP-1RA by the year 2030. Endogenous GLP-1 regulates blood glucose levels by augmenting glucose-dependent insulin release, by suppressing glucagon secretion and by slowing gastric emptying. Short acting (twice daily exenatide and lixisenatide) GLP-1RAs slow gastric emptying markedly in both healthy subjects and people with type 2 diabetes. It has been reported that the effects on gastric emptying are short lived, with infusions of GLP-1 leading to tachyphylaxis of effect. Leading from this, assumptions have been made that the gastric motility effects of longer acting GLP-1RAs are reduced with prolonged dosing. However, liraglutide, weekly exenatide and semaglutide have all been shown to profoundly inhibit gastric emptying, with both acute and sustained use. Tirzepatide has also been shown to delay gastric emptying in people with type 2 diabetes. Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), unlike GLP-1, has no effect on gastric emptying. Common adverse effects of GLP-1RAs and GLP-1/GIPRAs are gastrointestinal, including nausea and vomiting. However, the relationship between upper gastrointestinal symptoms and slowing of gastric emptying by GLP-1RAs is weak. There are increasing case reports and small case series of retained gastric contents and/or aspiration at the time of gastroscopy or anaesthesia in people with type 2 diabetes and/or obesity treated with GLP-1 RAs. Case reports have revealed that retained gastric contents can be present despite extended fasting following the consumption of a solid meal 20 h prior and a glass of water 8 h prior to a scheduled surgical procedure. A large cohort study of patients undergoing endoscopy found the use of GLP-1RAs increased the risk of potentially life-threatening aspiration pneumonia peri-procedurally (0.83% vs 0.63% absolute risk increase 0.2%; hazard ratio 1.33; 95% confidence interval 1.02 to 1.74; P = 0.036). Although case reports, retrospective observational studies and small prospective studies are usually insufficient to inform clinical practice, the safety concern regarding the peri-procedural use of GLP-1 RAs has recently led a number of overseas bodies to produce clinical practice recommendations regarding the peri-procedural use of GLP-1RAs. Specific Australian and New Zealand societal guidance was published in 2024, and is updated in this document.", "type": "Document"}

All patients should be asked about the use of GLP-1RAs and GLP-1/GIPRAs prior to anaesthesia or sedation for surgical and endoscopic procedures and be involved in discussion and planning regarding the risk of aspiration. Patients might not report the use of GLP-1RA/GLP-1/GIPRAs prior to their procedure owing to the effect of existing weight stigma on doctor\u2013patient communication, the belief that weight loss drugs are not medications and because they might have obtained these medications through direct supply, rather than prescription supply. Recommendation #2. Elective preprocedural cessation of GLP-1RA and GLP-1/GIPRAs is not recommended. Omission of long-acting GLP-1RA and GLP-1/GIPRAs (dulaglutide, semaglutide and tirzepatide) for 1\u20132 weeks is unlikely to alter the GLP-1RA induced slowing of gastric emptying. Omission for an extended duration may delay urgent surgery and/or lead to poor glycaemic control with the consequent risk of perioperative hyperglycaemia, which has previously been associated with increased morbidity and length of stay and potentially further deceleration of gastric emptying. Additionally, GLP-1RAs have been shown to have both cardio-protective and reno-protective effects and the effects of withdrawal of these medications on peri-procedural morbidity is unknown. Substitution of a different class of glucose-lowering drug for several weeks is often challenging in practice and the omission of therapy for prolonged periods may compromise weight control where patients are taking GLP-1RAs for this indication. Recommendation #3. Preprocedural diet modification consisting of a clear fluid diet on the day prior to the procedure, with standard 6-h fasting on the day of surgery, should be recommended for all patients receiving GLP-1 RAs and GLP-1/GIPRAs. Systematic reviews have found an increased risk of retained gastric contents at oesophago-gastroduodenoscopy in GLP-1RA users compared with controls. In contrast, the rate of retained gastric contents in GLP-1RA users undergoing both oesophago-gastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy was significantly reduced. This suggests that a prolonged clear fluid diet prior to GI endoscopy may mitigate the risk of retained gastric contents without discontinuing GLP-1RA therapy. There was no specific prescriptive \u2018standard 6 h fast\u2019, with advice to follow the usual local protocols with reference to ANZCA PG07 \u2018Guideline on pre-anaesthesia consultation and patient preparation\u2019. It should be noted that in this context, SipTilSend and similar limited fasting regimens may not be appropriate for patients on GLP-1 RAs and GLP-1/GIPRA therapy. Recommendation #4. Risk mitigation options should be undertaken for those who have not withheld solids for 24 h. Bedside point-of-care gastric ultrasound can be used to evaluate gastric content and volume to assess perioperative aspiration risk and guide anaesthetic management. Solid, particulate, or thick fluid content, carrying a high aspiration risk, can be detected based on sonographic appearance.Unsedated gastroscopy using ultrathin 5\u20136-mm endoscopes is often well tolerated and allows preservation of airway protective reflexes. Retained gastric contents can be directly visualised. It is important to note that patients may forcibly retch with use of the ultrathin endoscope and oral suction may be required in the event of pharyngeal contamination despite intact protective reflexes.The absence of gastrointestinal symptoms is an unreliable indicator of gastric emptying. The majority of studies that have evaluated the relationship between the effects of GLP-1RAs on gastric emptying and gastrointestinal symptoms in health, obesity or type 2 diabetes report no or low correlation between the appearance of symptoms and delayed gastric emptying. Recommendation #5. It is reasonable to use erythromycin to counteract GLP-1RA and GLP-1/GIPRA induced inhibition of gastric emptying. In healthy male subjects receiving a GLP-1 infusion, 200 mg of intravenous erythromycin completely reverses the GLP-1 induced deceleration of gastric emptying while other prokinetic drugs, including metoclopramide, cisapride and domperidone, have no effect. Contraindications to the administration of erythromycin should be considered. The effectiveness of intravenous erythromycin to accelerate gastric emptying in individuals on GLP-1RA-based therapy in the periprocedural setting has yet to be evaluated, so repeat gastric ultrasound or minimally sedated gastroscopy with ultrathin 5 mm gastroscope should be used where available to assess erythromycin effects on gastric contents. Recommendation #6. In the absence of risk modification with a 24 h clear fluid diet or risk stratification with gastric ultrasound or ultrathin gastroscopy or administration of intravenous erythromycin, all patients taking GLP-1RA and GLP-1/GIPRAs should be considered non-fasted/to have a full stomach. If, after consideration of the risks and benefits, a decision is made to defer the procedure, arrangements should be made for the patient to follow a clear fluid diet for 24 h prior to the rescheduled procedure. Consider a longer period of clear fluid diet if retained gastric contents were present despite following mitigation strategies.If, after consideration of the risks and benefits, a decision is made to proceed with the procedure, anaesthesia should be administered according to local practices for a non-fasted patient. Appropriate anaesthetic techniques should be applied to protect against pulmonary aspiration. Without being prescriptive, consideration should be given to regional anaesthetic techniques with minimal sedation and maintenance of upper airways reflexes, or rapid sequence induction for patients requiring general anaesthesia. The evidence supporting these recommendations is based on case reports and retrospective data (low-quality evidence) and there remains uncertainty between the overall risks and benefits of continuing GLP-1RA and GLP-1/GIPRAs peri-procedurally. Therefore, these guidelines represent a \u2018conditional\u2019 GRADE recommendation for clinical practice. Given the uncertainty of the evidence and knowledge base surrounding GLP-1RAs and GLP-1RA/GIPRAs in the peri-procedural period, these guidelines are planned to be reviewed in 2026. The final complete guidelines as approved by the organisations involved are publicly available on the websites of those organisations (anzca.edu.au, diabetessociety.com.au, gesa.org.au, nacos.org.au).", "type": "Document"}

The options for preoperative nutrition are oral supplementation, enteral feeding and if the digestive route is contraindicated or cannot be assessed, a parenteral nutrition, or even the association of the three modalities These data provided strong evidence that preoperative nutrition decreases postoperative complications and length of stay. Clinical trials in surgical patients have investigated the impact of immune-enhancing nutrition, including arginine and omega-3 fatty acids, on postoperative outcomes, , , , The benefits, which also include reduction of nosocomial stay, can be observed with at least five days of immune-enhanced nutrition preoperatively in major procedures and continuing for seven days postoperatively in cases of severe malnutrition", "type": "Document"}

This review has explored the multifaceted components that define an ERP, especially the ERAS and ACERTO protocols, emphasizing the integration of evidence-based interventions across the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative phases. ERPs in digestive surgery can benefit not only the patient but also reduce costs in digestive surgery, Collaborative efforts between multidisciplinary teams, including surgeons, anesthesiologists, nurses, dieticians, physiotherapists, and other healthcare professionals, are crucial for successful ERPs implementation. By fostering a culture of continuous improvement and staying abreast of emerging evidence, healthcare providers can ensure that ERPs remain dynamic and responsive to evolving patient needs in their institution. It is also vital to have a hospital early discharge plan in mind, which should be done during the patient\u2019s hospital stay, identifying potential discharge needs and constraints as soon as possible. Surgeons should involve a multidisciplinary team, including physicians, nurses, social workers, therapists, the family of the patient, and other relevant healthcare professionals in the discharge planning process. In summary, this article delved into the principles, components, and outcomes of ERPs in digestive surgery, highlighting their transformative impact on postoperative recovery. By embracing ERPs, healthcare institutions improve patient outcomes besides contributing to a paradigm of care that prioritizes individualized and evidence-based interventions, setting a new standard for surgical excellence in the modern era.\n", "type": "Document"}

When the systematic review of the collected evidence was conducted after five years since the last publication, we noticed a remarkable evolution of the knowledge on the subject, particularly in cardiology. In the perioperative environment, the physician needs to simultaneously gather concepts from different specialties to understand different aspects of the same problem and to optimize the language among clinicians, surgeons, anesthesiologists, and intensivists. Although problems related to other disciplines are addressed in this III Guidelines, we decided that the text should adopt the point of view of a cardiologist. In line with this decision, the III Guidelines incorporated the term cardiovascular and was thus termed Guidelines for Perioperative Cardiovascular Evaluation. Based on new findings, some novelties were included, such as new oral anticoagulants and surgical interventions in patients with dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), in patients with last generation stents. Anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents were discussed in more detail for specific surgical procedures, such as dental, dermatological, endoscopic, and ophthalmologic.", "type": "Document"}

Preoperative Evaluation > A) History\nCollection of clinical history is the first approach in perioperative evaluation. Anamnesis performed with the patient or family members may provide information on the clinical conditions that determine the estimated surgical risk. The algorithms for perioperative risk assessment use the data obtained by clinical history and physical examination. The study of medical records in medical charts and anesthetic records is useful for retrieving previous information. To guide the evaluation of surgical risk, the following data are obtained in clinical history: Information of the underlying disease, which indicates the surgical procedure, including information from the surgeon on the risk and location of the procedure, the availability of technical support regarding personnel and equipment, the type of anesthesia, the estimated surgical time, and the need for transfusion; clinical, sociodemographic, and cultural data, such as age, gender, blood type, positive serology for hepatitis C virus, and acceptance of transfusion; data to assess the patient\u2019s psychological/psychiatric condition; thorough investigation of surgical or anesthetic history that may reveal potentially preventable complications or allergies; determination of functional capacity, investigating daily activities ( Investigation of the clinical condition and the need to compensate for coexisting diseases, with a focus on identifying the presence of serious cardiovascular conditions in the perioperative stage ( In patients more than 65 years old, verification of the degree of fragility; identification of the presence of valvular heart disease (item 4.D), valvular prostheses, and the need for prophylaxis for bacterial endocarditis (item 7.E); investigation of risk factors for cardiopathies; record of the presence of pacemaker or cardioverter/implantable defibrillator and adequate management (item 4.G); diagnosis of peripheral vascular disease, renal insufficiency, cerebral vascular disease, diabetes mellitus (DM), liver disease, hemorrhagic disorders, thyroid disorders, obstructive sleep apnea, and chronic lung disease; use of drugs, phytotherapics, alcohol, illicit drugs, and evaluation of potential interference with the operative procedure.

Preoperative Evaluation > B) Physical Examination\nPhysical examination is useful during the perioperative risk assessment process and should not be limited to the cardiovascular system. This examination aims to identify pre-existing or potential cardiopathy (risk factors), define the severity and stability of the heart disease, and identify possible comorbidities. Patients with heart disease whose general condition is compromised by other conditions, such as neurological diseases, renal failure, infections, liver abnormalities, malnutrition, and pulmonary dysfunction, are at a higher risk of cardiac complications because such conditions exacerbate surgical stress. Patients with peripheral vascular disease have a high incidence of ischemic heart disease, which is a prognostic factor of perioperative complication. Evidence of, for example, changes in arterial pulses or carotid bruit should be investigated in physical examination. On the other hand, turgid jugulars in preoperative consultation, indicating high central venous pressure (CVP), suggest that the patient may develop postoperative pulmonary edema. The evidence of a third heart sound (S3) in the preoperative evaluation is indicative of poor prognosis with an increased risk of pulmonary edema, myocardial infarction, or cardiac death. The evidence of lower limb edema (bilateral) should be analyzed in combination with the presence or absence of jugular venous distention. If CVP is increased, visualized by the height of the oscillation of the pulse of the internal jugular vein, then cardiopathy and pulmonary hypertension (PH) are responsible, at least partially, for the patient\u2019s edema. If CVP is not increased, other causes, such as liver disease, nephrotic syndrome, chronic peripheral venous insufficiency, or use of some medication, are responsible for the edema. Evidence of edema alone and without knowledge of the patient\u2019s CVP is not a definite sign of heart disease. In the presence of heart murmurs, the physician should be able to distinguish between organic and functional murmurs, determine if they are significant or not, and identify their origin. The origin will indicate whether endocarditis prophylaxis or evaluation of valvular lesion severity is necessary (items 4.D and 7.E). In elderly patients, a brief assessment of fragility can be performed using the timed up and go test. In this test, time is measured in seconds with a timer starting from the point when the patient is given the command to get up from a chair and walk three meters forward and return, and ending when the patient sits back in the chair. A test time equal to or greater than 20 seconds is considered poor/low. A test time equal to or greater than 15 seconds is associated with postoperative complications and increased mortality in a period of one year.", "type": "Document"}

Preoperative Evaluation > C) Additional Tests\nIn the perioperative evaluation of patients scheduled for surgical procedures, requesting of preoperative tests [electrocardiogram (ECG), chest X-ray, and laboratory tests] is a common and routine clinical practice. However, this is not related to the reduction or prediction of perioperative complications and has a high economic cost for the health system. Therefore, revisions elaborated by several societies have recommended the rational use of tests. In the literature, few studies have evaluated the benefit and impact of preoperative routine tests. Cataract surgery is the surgical procedure that presents the best evidence. Three randomized studies compared performing and not performing routine preoperative examinations and the occurrence of postoperative events in patients undergoing cataract surgery. The systematic review of these three studies, involving 21,531 patients, showed a similar frequency of complications between the two groups. The authors concluded that performing preoperative tests does not increase the safety of cataract surgery and is associated with a 2.5-fold higher cost when compared to the group that did not perform preoperative tests. Despite the evidence in the literature, routinely requesting preoperative tests is still common in clinical practice. In a cohort study with 440,857 patients, the authors observed that more than half of the patients undergoing cataract surgery had a preoperative test, especially when the evaluation is performed by ophthalmologists. For other surgeries, only one randomized study investigated the effect of routine preoperative tests on the occurrence of postoperative events and complications. The population of this study mainly consisted of patients with low clinical risk, without serious diseases or decompensated clinical conditions, who underwent small and outpatient surgeries. In this study, the patients were randomized to perform the proposed surgery with or without preoperative tests (ECG, chest X-ray, blood count, urea, creatinine, electrolytes, and glucose). No difference in perioperative morbidity and mortality was found between patients who performed preoperative evaluation with complementary tests and those who did not perform additional tests. The American National Institute of Health conducted an observational study on 73,596 patients undergoing low-risk and selected outpatient procedures (hernia surgeries). The authors reported that 54% of those without comorbidities underwent preoperative tests. The frequency of perioperative complications was extremely low (0.3%). The performance of preoperative tests or the presence of abnormalities in these tests did not predict complications. An extensive review of the literature has shown very limited evidence of clinical effectiveness to recommend routine preoperative tests. No study has demonstrated the cost-effectiveness of preoperative tests in healthy individuals undergoing low-risk or intermediate non-cardiac surgeries. Abnormal findings in routine tests are relatively frequent, but these results rarely lead to changes in surgical procedure or surgery suspension. In addition, changes in preoperative tests do not predict complications. In conclusion, there is no indication to perform routine laboratory tests in the preoperative evaluation in asymptomatic patients submitted to low-risk procedures. The indication of preoperative tests should be customized in accordance to the history and physical examination, the diseases and comorbidities presented by the patients, as well as the type and extent of the proposed surgery.", "type": "Document"}

In addition, a baseline electrocardiographic tracing is important for perioperative comparative evaluation in patients at high risk for cardiovascular events.

Risk Indices\nSeveral papers in the literature have compared the accuracy of existing indices for different populations of surgical patients. Most of these studies show that the various existing indices, although not very accurate, can predict events and should be used in perioperative assessment. Among the risk indices with cardiovascular outcomes, we highlight the Lee\u2019s Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI), the index developed by the American College of Physicians (ACP), and the Multicenter Perioperative Evaluation Study (EMAPO-www.consultoriodigital.com.br - the Multicenter Perioperative Evaluation Study was developed and validated in the Brazilian population. All indices have advantages and disadvantages that must be considered during their use. When estimating risk, we should consider which outcome we are predicting: the ACP algorithm predicts the occurrence of AMI and cardiovascular death. The RCRI estimates the risk of AMI, acute pulmonary edema, total atrioventricular block, and cardiorespiratory arrest. The RCRI is widely validated in the literature and shows moderate level of accuracy in predicting events in noncardiac surgeries; this index is less accurate in patients undergoing arterial aortic vascular surgeries and peripheral revascularizations. Thus, in a specific evaluation guideline on risk assessment in patients undergoing vascular surgeries, the VSG-CRI (Vascular Study Group of New England Cardiac Risk Index) is proposed as an alternative to the RCRI; it is adapted from RCRI with additional variables. When the aim is to estimate global risk, not only related to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, the ACS NSQIP Surgical Risk Calculator (www.riskcalculator.facs.org), which has been recently developed by the American College of Surgeons, can be used. This tool was developed using data from more than 1 million surgeries in 393 hospitals in the United States. It had good prediction accuracy in that population. This index includes, in addition to the specific type of surgical procedure, 21 clinical variables, providing a risk assessment of 8 different outcomes. On the other hand, this tool presents some limitations related to subjective variables and still needs validation in other populations. As already discussed, risk indices have advantages and limitations, and none of them is perfect. It should be kept in mind that the risk index selected should be used as a complement, but never a replacement, to the evaluator\u2019s opinion. Data or evidence is not always available in the literature for all situations. Thus, assessment should be customized. In those cases where the evaluating physician considers that the index is underestimating the actual risk, this observation should be mentioned in the evaluation. In addition to the risk indices already mentioned, other features related to surgical procedure and patient should be considered in the evaluation of the risk of perioperative events.

Additional Preoperative Evaluation > A) Evaluation of Ventricular Function at Rest\nResting echocardiography in the preoperative period of noncardiac surgery is not a routine test. However, in specific situations, it may offer additional risk information that may be useful for future therapeutic decisions. The use of this procedure in preoperative patients is to evaluate right and left ventricular dysfunction and signs of myocardial ischemia or valvular abnormalities, which are not detected previously in the clinical examination, chest X-ray, or even the ECG. Although controversial, it may be indicated in patients with a surgical risk that justifies this investigation. Transthoracic echocardiography is the main diagnostic method in patients with suspected or known HF. By using this method, including refined methods of analysis, such as myocardial strain imaging and three-dimensional echocardiography, we can accurately assess ventricular volume, ejection fraction, cardiac output, longitudinal strain, and degree of hemodynamic impairment. Assessment can be performed by determining the diastolic function and pressures in the pulmonary artery and left atrium using the E/e\u2019 ratio and the presence and location of cardiac dys-synchrony in patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction < 35% or with a QRS > 120 ms. However, routine echocardiography is not indicated in all patients because no evidence exists to support that its use is associated with increased survival or shorter hospital stays. Several studies suggest that echocardiography increases hospitalization time, without leading to clinical benefit. Additionally, in patients with acute HF, clinical compensation should be performed, whenever possible, prior to the intervention. In patients with known or suspected valve disease, particularly those with moderate or severe aortic stenosis, severe mitral stenosis, severe mitral or aortic regurgitation, and those with intracardiac prostheses, transthoracic or transesophageal echocardiography should be used to determine the severity of the valve disease, help preoperative clinical treatment and guide prophylaxis or therapy for infective endocarditis (item 7.E).", "type": "Document"}

Additional Preoperative Evaluation > B) Noninvasive Tests to Detect Myocardial Ischemia > I. Electrocardiogram Exercise Testing\nThe pathophysiology of perioperative MI differs from that of spontaneous MI. Perioperative MI can be caused by plaque rupture in approximately half of the cases or by imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply (anemia, low flow, etc.) and demand (tachycardia and hypertension). Exercise ECG testing is a safe, useful, and effective tool to detect myocardial ischemia, which is produced by an imbalance between supply and demand. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that detection of abnormalities while performing this test may be reproducible during the perioperative period and its varying levels of stress. However, whether this strategy leads to reduction of perioperative cardiovascular events in all cases is unknown. It should also be considered that lower prevalence of coronary disease in a population results in lower positive predictive value of the exercise ECG testing. Considering that risk stratification aims to reduce perioperative risk, performing the test in a population already stratified as low risk by the recommended algorithms is not logical. Therefore, in cases of low prevalence of coronary artery disease (CAD), the exercise ECG testing would not add value to the perioperative clinical stratification. It could also delay the surgery and require more specific tests to differentiate the true results from the false-positive. Even in high-risk individuals, such as those undergoing preoperative vascular surgery, the predictive value, sensitivity, and specificity of the exercise ECG testing (10%, 74%, and 69%, respectively) are low, but with a high negative predictive value (98%). On the other hand, in a cohort study, performance of provocative ischemic preoperative tests in high-risk patients, with three or more clinical risk factors, is associated with shorter hospital stays and lower mortality. Thus, among asymptomatic individuals with a higher prevalence of the disease, the exercise ECG testing could be requested only if the result would influence the prognosis and, consequently, preoperative decisions, or to provide a more intensive clinical therapy or even a myocardial revascularization procedure. In this case, the onset of ischemic response at low load is associated with a higher number of perioperative cardiac events. On the other hand, patients with exercise tolerance up to 4-5 METS have a good perioperative prognosis.", "type": "Document"}

Stress Myocardial Perfusion Scintigraphy\nThe exercise ECG testing is safe, useful, and effective to detect myocardial ischemia and has a good cost-risk-benefit ratio, but has limitations, such as patients with physical limitations, patients who present abnormal ST-segment changes or left bundle bock in the baseline ECG. The alternative for such patients is an imaging method with pharmacological stress (adenosine, dobutamine, or dipyridamole). In this context, myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MPS), when possible associated with exercise and, within the physical limitations, pharmacological stress, has a good accuracy and prognostic value. In a meta-analysis of 1,179 patients submitted to vascular surgery, MPS with dipyridamole demonstrated a greater number of perioperative cardiovascular events, proportional to the presence and extent of perfusion defects. Those with reversible ischemia in up to 20% of the left ventricular extension had the same events with those without ischemia. However, when the area affected was 20-29%, 30-49%, and above 50%, the probability of cardiac events was 1.6, 2.9, and 11 times higher, respectively. Another meta-analysis with the same method and similar profile of patients showed that patients without perfusion defect, with fixed defect, and with reversible defect presented mortality and nonfatal MI rates of 1%, 7%, and 9%, respectively. Patients with two or more perfusion defects have a high incidence of cardiac events. Gated-associated MPS, which allows assessment of both myocardial perfusion and cardiac function, has been recently shown to be a useful tool for risk stratification in vascular surgeries. In one study, abnormal final systolic volume (more than twice the standard deviation) was the only independent variable to predict cardiac events. Patients with normal perfusion but with changes in contractility had significantly more cardiac events than those with normal contractility and perfusion (16% x 2%; p < 0.0001). In conclusion, in the perioperative evaluation, the indications for Gated-associated MPS are similar to those of the exercise ECG testing. It is the best option for patients with physical limitations. It is also the best alternative when the ECG is impossible to interpret due to baseline changes of the ST-segment and when the result of the exercise ECG testing is a possible false positive", "type": "Document"}

Cardiac Troponins\nThe increased sensitivity of the available troponin kits provided a greater accuracy and rapidity in the diagnosis of MI in patients with chest pain in the emergency room. On the other hand, in the perioperative period of noncardiac operations, the available scientific evidence does not include all troponins (I and T) or all assays used, which have different detection limits and reference values. For this reason and due to the importance of this diagnostic tool, we decided to include a detailed explanation of the available methods before the recommendations in this guideline. The detection limit represents the minimum value that is detected by the method. The reference value of normality is determined using the 99th percentile, which is obtained by performing the test in a normal population, and indicates that 99% of normal individuals have values below this cut-off. Troponin assays can be classified as low sensitivity (conventional), medium sensitivity (contemporary or sensitive), or high sensitivity. This classification is based on the percentage of healthy individuals in whom troponin can be detected. Contemporary troponin assays (medium sensitivity) can detect values above the 99% percentile (altered values); however, troponin is only detected in a few normal individuals. High sensitivity assays can determine values of this marker (limit of detection) in 50-95% of normal individuals. To properly interpret and request troponin as a biomarker in the perioperative period, the physician must be familiar with the troponin assay used in their hospital. Notably, in the preoperative period, only the Roche high-sensitivity troponin T (hs-TnT) assay has been tested in the available studies and may have clinical applicability. In the postoperative period, most studied troponins are conventional and some are sensitive (as specified in item 7.F). Some published papers demonstrate the efficacy of high sensitivity preoperative troponin as a marker of perioperative cardiovascular complications and general mortality in noncardiac surgeries. Nagele et al. studied 608 patients who underwent noncardiac surgery. They showed that 41% had increased values of hs-TnT above the 99th percentile (> 14 ng/L) in the preoperative period. The increase in preoperative hs-TnT was associated with a higher total mortality during a 3-year follow-up. These findings were confirmed in a study involving 455 patients undergoing vascular surgeries. In this study, patients with increased hs-TnT in the preoperative period presented a greater number of cardiovascular events in the postoperative period. In a comparison to Lee\u2019s RCRI algorithm in 979 patients aged more than 55 years with at least one cardiovascular risk factor submitted to noncardiac surgeries, preoperative hs-TnT presented an area under the ROC curve (0.78) similar to the RCRI (0.68; p = 0.07) in predicting combined cardiovascular events (mortality, MI, recovered cardiac arrest, and acute HF). In addition, in a multivariate analysis, increased hs-TnT in the preoperative period was an independent predictor of these combined events (HR 2.6; p = 0.008). As for general mortality, hs-TnT was superior to RCRI (area under the curve 0.81 \u00d7 0.66, p = 0.006). The prevalence of preoperative hs-TnT increases varies between 21% and 41%, depending on the age and risk factors, such as diabetes, CAD, systemic arterial hypertension, and renal failure. No study has evaluated the role of high-sensitivity troponin I (hs-TnI) in predicting cardiovascular events in the preoperative period. Contemporary/sensitive TnI was evaluated in 560 patients undergoing noncardiac surgeries, with only 5% presenting preoperative values above the 99th percentile. Its use did not improve the prediction of risk of perioperative cardiovascular events. In conclusion, measurement of troponins with conventional or contemporary/sensitive assays is not useful in the preoperative period and should not be performed. On the other hand, the hs-TnT measurement in the preoperative period can be used as a tool for risk stratification associated with the use of the algorithms. In addition, these data help to establish a baseline value in patients with indication for postoperative monitoring, facilitating the interpretation of postoperative values of hs-TnT and the diagnosis of postoperative MI (items 7.F and 8.A).", "type": "Document"}

Natriuretic Peptides\nOThe risk scores usually used in the perioperative evaluation enable to estimate the risk of cardiovascular events in the perioperative period with moderate accuracy. Tests to evaluate ischemia, as well as biomarkers (troponins and natriuretic peptides), allow to refine the risk assessment before surgery. Natriuretic peptides are released into the bloodstream by the heart in response to multiple physiological stimuli, such as myocardial stress and ischemia. Several studies demonstrated that high preoperative levels of BNP are potent predictors of perioperative cardiovascular complications. The two studies by Biccard et al. conducted investigations on patients submitted to arterial vascular surgery. In 2011, they reported that preoperative BNP was an independent predictor of increased postoperative troponin levels in a cohort of 267 patients undergoing vascular surgery. They also reported that the use of this biomarker improved the risk prediction of Lee\u2019s RCRI in 38-70% in patients classified as intermediate risk. In 2012, the authors evaluated 788 patients undergoing vascular surgery and showed that increased preoperative BNP levels was an independent predictor of cardiac events in a period of 30 days (OR = 5.0; p < 0.001). A meta-analysis involving individual data from six different studies evaluated natriuretic peptides as predictors of events in patients undergoing vascular surgeries. The study confirmed that increased preoperative natriuretic peptide level is an independent predictor of events (cardiac death or nonfatal MI) in up to 30 days after surgery. It was also observed that it improves the predictive value of the RCRI. With regard to patients undergoing nonvascular surgeries, there are no studies that exclusively evaluate this population. The vast majority of the studies involve both vascular and nonvascular surgeries. In a meta-analysis published in 2009, including 15 prospective observational studies and 4,856 patients submitted to vascular or nonvascular surgeries, the authors found that increased preoperative BNP or NT-proBNP levels was associated with a high (nearly 20-fold higher) risk of major cardiovascular events, cardiac mortality, and mortality due to all causes (almost 10-fold) in the perioperative period (< 43 days after surgery). However, whether prognostic information was improved in these studies, considering the existing risk indices, were not determined. More recently, a prospective multicenter observational study analyzed 979 patients aged more than 55 years with at least one cardiovascular risk factor (hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, smoking, family history) in the preoperative period of noncardiac surgery. The study aimed to assess increases in hs-Tn as a risk predictor compared to the Lee\u2019s RCRI, with 93% of the patients with RCRI < 2. In this study, the authors also evaluated the role of natriuretic peptides as risk predictors in noncardiac surgery. They observed that both hs-Tn levels and NTproBNP levels were higher in individuals with cardiovascular events and seemed to provide additional information to the RCRI. Finally, a meta-analysis conducted in 2014 included 18 prospective observational studies. The authors assessed individual data from 2,179 patients undergoing noncardiac (vascular and nonvascular) surgery. They demonstrated that postoperative levels of BNP and NTproBNP provide additional risk prediction of death or nonfatal infarction in a period of 30 and 180 days to a risk prediction model that includes preoperative BNP. They also showed that high values of BNP/NTproBNP both in the postoperative (OR = 3.7; p < 0.001) and preoperative (OR = 1.9; p < 0.001) periods were independent predictors of death or nonfatal MI in a period of 30 days.

At present, in addition to the mentioned interval, we consider all the relevant factors for the prognosis of patients with CAD, independently of the perioperative context. These factors include presence of angina, HF, electrocardiographic signs, extent, and threshold of ischemia, and coronary anatomy, if relevant. The routine and indiscriminate performance of additional tests, such as functional tests and invasive coronary angiography, has no proven benefit, even in the population already diagnosed with CAD. A careful anamnesis associated with propaedeutics of the circulatory system and basic additional tests, such as rest ECG and chest X-ray, is often sufficient to determine the surgical risk of CAD patients. The request for functional tests must comply with the indications mentioned in item 3.B.IV.", "type": "Document"}

Diseases and Conditions with Specific Features in the Perioperative Period > B) Systemic Arterial Hypertension\nSystemic arterial hypertension is a very common clinical condition, not only in the general population but also in patients who undergo surgical procedures. This condition, especially if uncontrolled, is one of the most common reasons for cancelling surgery. This is because systemic hypertension is associated with increased perioperative mortality. On the other hand, a study of carotid endarterectomy suggested that a patient with hypertension under control may not have an increased risk of perioperative morbidity and mortality, which suggests the importance of adequate control. Major hemodynamic changes can occur during a surgical procedure, being more pronounced in patients with hypertension. These hemodynamic changes, which are associated with pain and anxiety, are aggravated by withdrawal of antihypertensive drugs on the day before the procedure. Increasing knowledge on the pathophysiology of hypertension and antihypertensive therapy, as well as the development of new anesthetics and muscle relaxants with minimal hemodynamic effects, in addition to postoperative pain control protocols, have contributed to minimize the occurrence of complications during the perioperative period of hypertensive patients. One of the mechanisms involved is the sympathetic activation observed during anesthetic induction and in the postoperative period. Increases in sympathetic activity may cause significant increases in blood pressure, particularly in patients with uncontrolled arterial hypertension. Supporting the importance of sympathetic hyperactivity, evidence suggests that clonidine, when used in the perioperative period of hypertensive patients, significantly reduces blood pressure and heart rate variation, as well as reduces the need for anesthetic (isoflurane) and narcotic administration in these patients. Despite this, no evidence is available on the choice of antihypertensive agents in the perioperative period. In general, stage 2 hypertension with SBP > 180 mmHg and DBP > 110 mmHg must be controlled before surgery. However, in mild or moderate hypertension, in which metabolic or cardiovascular changes do not occur, no evidence has been established on the benefits of postponing surgery. The perioperative strategy should generally be to maintain blood pressure within 20% of the preoperative values (provided this value is not too uncontrolled), which implies flexibility in the control, not necessarily to normal levels. This may reduce the occurrence of hypertensive emergencies in the perioperative period. Patients with some degree of autonomic dysfunction (such as that in hypertensive patients) are more susceptible to intraoperative hypotension than normotensive patients. This phenomenon appears to be more frequent in patients who use angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in the preoperative period. In most cases, this may be related to reduced intravascular volume; thus, avoiding perioperative hypovolemia is fundamental. However, abrupt withdrawal of these drugs should not be performed, because both uncontrolled blood pressure and decompensated HF may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications. Patients with suspected secondary hypertension should be investigated prior to surgery, except in urgent/emergency cases. There is no conclusive evidence on the increase in perioperative risk in patients with secondary hypertension; however, patients with undiagnosed pheochromocytoma have a mortality rate of approximately 80% during surgery. Cardiac and blood pressure monitoring in hypertensive patients is essential during the surgical procedure to detect variations of blood pressure and signs of ischemia as early as possible. In addition to being a risk factor for CAD, hypertension is associated with ventricular hypertrophy, systolic dysfunction, renal failure, and cerebrovascular events during the perioperative period. This aspect should be considered in the perioperative volume management of hypertensive patients with altered ventricular geometry and arterial elasticity, particularly the elderly. In the intraoperative period, the ideal antihypertensive agent should be easily titrated, rapid acting, have minimal side effects, and inexpensive. Several antihypertensive classes are available, including \u03b2-blockers (esmolol, labetalol), calcium channel blockers (nicardipine), and nitrates (sodium nitroprusside and nitroglycerin).", "type": "Document"}

Diseases and Conditions with Specific Features in the Perioperative Period > C) Heart Failure\nHF affects about 1-2% of the general population in developed countries and more than 10% of the population aged more than 70 years, CVDs are the main cause of death in Brazil, representing approximately 29% of the deaths in the country. Ischemic heart disease and HF are responsible for approximately 39% of these CVD deaths. HF is a well-known risk factor for perioperative cardiac events. Data from a large registry of noncardiac surgeries, which included more than 150,000 procedures, revealed that the presence of HF was associated with a 63% increase in the risk of perioperative mortality and a 51% increase in the risk of rehospitalization in a period of 30 days, when compared to the group with CAD without HF. Reduced ejection fraction is considered a strong predictor of events in patients undergoing vascular surgery. However, most of studies analyzed ejection fraction as a categorical variable (higher or lower than 40%). A recent study involving 174 patients with HF revealed that only severely reduced ejection fraction (< 30%) is an independent predictor of mortality. Moderate (30-40%) or mild (40-50%) ejection fraction reduction and preserved ejection fraction HF (> 50%) were not independent predictor of death in a period of 30 days. Despite the predictive value of ejection fraction, performing routine echocardiography for all patients undergoing noncardiac surgery is not indicated. A Canadian cohort study involving more than 250,000 patients (15% with preoperative echocardiography) revealed that preoperative echocardiography is not associated with improvement in survival or reduction of hospitalization time after major noncardiac surgery. Increased level of natriuretic peptides in the preoperative period is related to worse prognosis in the perioperative period, because it is related to worsening of ventricular function and higher rate of cardiovascular events. Measurement of these biomarkers may aid in the risk stratification of patients with HF. However, clinical evaluation and functional condition are even more relevant in the perioperative assessment of patients with HF. Clinical management in the perioperative period requires special care regarding the blood volume of the patient. Both hypovolemia, which may intensify hypotension, and hypervolemia, which may lead to pulmonary and systemic congestion, should be avoided. Patients with preserved fraction HF due to increased left ventricular stiffness are also susceptible to pulmonary edema, secondary to volume overload. Therefore, the use of diuretics and vasodilators may be necessary to avoid hypervolemia and afterload increases.", "type": "Document"}

Diseases and Conditions with Specific Features in the Perioperative Period > D) Valvular Heart Disease\nPatients with valvular heart disease have a higher risk of presenting cardiovascular complications in the perioperative period of noncardiac surgeries.63 The risk varies depending on the valvular heart disease and its anatomic severity, as well as the type of noncardiac surgery to be performed. The main cardiovascular complications in the perioperative period of noncardiac surgeries in patients with valvular heart disease are as follows: pulmonary congestion/acute pulmonary edema, cardiogenic shock, MI, tachyarrhythmias, embolic events, bleeding, and infective endocarditis. In patients with valvular heart disease, particularly if anatomically relevant, clinical evaluation performed by a cardiologist should be considered in the preoperative period of noncardiac surgeries. When valvular heart disease is suspected after detailed medical history and physical examination, transthoracic echocardiography should be performed with the following objectives: quantify the anatomic severity of valvular disease, assess ventricular function and remodeling of cardiac chambers, and estimate right chamber pressure. If doubt persists, other diagnostic methods may be performed, such as transesophageal echocardiography, magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, and cardiac catheterization. Stenotic valvular heart disease have a higher perioperative risk than regurgitant valvular heart disease . Therefore, additional care should be given to patients with aortic (AoS) or mitral (MS) stenosis undergoing noncardiac surgery. Symptomatic patients with anatomically relevant valvular heart disease already present high morbidity and mortality in the history of valvular heart disease and are indicated for interventional valve treatment. This patient group presents a high risk of perioperative cardiac complications if submitted to noncardiac surgery. Therefore, they should initially treat valvular heart disease and subsequently undergo noncardiac surgery. However, if the noncardiac surgery is an emergency, it should be performed without prior correction of valvular heart disease, even if it is anatomically relevant. The use of statins in the perioperative period of patients with valvular heart disease has not been evaluated in prospective studies. Therefore, statins should not be prescribed without another indication. Similarly, the use of nitroglycerin or even the use of intraoperative cardiac output monitoring has not been evaluated in these patients. On the other hand, although there is no formal indication for the use of \u03b2-blockers in valvular heart disease patients in the perioperative period of noncardiac surgeries, these drugs can be used in patients with MS.", "type": "Document"}

Diseases and Conditions with Specific Features in the Perioperative Period > D) Valvular Heart Disease > I. Aortic Stenosis\nAoS is the most common valvular heart disease in elderly patients, affecting 2-4% of adults aged more than 65 years. The prevalence of AoS is expected to double in the next 20 years, with the progressive aging of the population. Several studies have shown that patients with moderate to severe AoS may have a high risk of cardiac complications during noncardiac surgery. However, in many of these studies, the definition and degree of AoS were ambiguous or based on few details. Since most studies included symptomatic or ventricular dysfunction patients, it is unclear whether aortic valve replacement surgery should precede the noncardiac procedure. The study by Calleja et al., which included 30 patients with anatomically relevant AoS and 60 controls (mild to moderate AoS), was the only one to exclude symptomatic patients. They showed similar MI or death rates during noncardiac surgery, mostly with low or intermediate risk. For these reasons, Samarendra et al. recommended a new flowchart to assess the perioperative risk of noncardiac surgeries in patients with AoS. Patients with a high risk of cardiac complications are those with an average gradient > 45-50 mmHg and/or valvular area < 0.8 cm2; left ventricular systolic dysfunction; symptomatic AoS; significant mitral regurgitation or other associated valvular diseases; increase in \u2265 18 mmHg in the average gradient during exercise; and associated CAD. Furthermore, in a recent study with 218 patients, Mizuno et al. demonstrated that patients with AoS who underwent a major noncardiac surgery present a faster progression of aortic valve disease compared to controls with AoS who did not undergo surgical intervention. For the above reasons, it is recommended to first correct the anatomically relevant AoS, even if asymptomatic, in patients who will undergo intermediate- or high-risk noncardiac surgeries. On the other hand, some patients with relevant AoS scheduled for noncardiac surgery have clinical indication for correction of valvular heart disease , but present a high risk for cardiac surgery or are ineligible for the conventional cardiac procedure. For these cases, a transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is an option preceding noncardiac surgery. When patients with relevant AoS are submitted to urgent/emergency noncardiac surgery, preoperative clinical compensation is recommended with the use of diuretics, as well as postoperative period in an ICU, with hemodynamic and electrocardiographic monitoring and serial measurement of myocardial necrosis markers.", "type": "Document"}

This distinction must be made by the cardiologist before the elective procedures. There is limited data in the literature on the real impact of arrhythmias in this period, impairing the selection of a specific approach. Therefore, the recommendations are usually extrapolated from routine evaluation and outpatient or emergency decisions. The factors that can trigger supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias and should be investigated include electrolyte imbalances (hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia), hypoxemia, proarrhythmic drugs (antidepressants, stimulants, positive inotropes, anesthetics), and metabolic disorders (hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism).

On the other hand, about 20% of the population can present these arrhythmias in the 24-hour Holter exam performed routinely. Evaluation of extrasystolic arrhythmias includes collecting personal and family history. The occurrence of symptoms of hemodynamic intolerance (syncope or pre-syncope, precordial pain) may indicate complex or sustained arrhythmias. The presence of family history of sudden cardiac death may indicate the need for specific evaluation. In asymptomatic young patients with no personal or family history of heart disease, isolated monomorphic ventricular extrasystoles may generally be benign and with no implications in the perioperative period. In low-risk surgeries, evaluation of the ECG and cardiac area by chest X-ray may be sufficient and suspension of noncardiac surgery is unnecessary. Suspicion of adjacent structural disease can be detected in ECG. ECG can identify ventricular overload, inactive area, conduction system diseases, and other rarer arrhythmic syndromes. Thoracic radiography is an important screening procedure for pulmonary diseases and detection of increased cardiothoracic index. Echocardiogram is a sensitive method that should be used for additional morphological analysis. An exercise ECG testing may be useful to demonstrate the presence of ischemia as a triggering factor for ventricular arrhythmias or to demonstrate benignity when dealing with idiopathic arrhythmias, which are suppressed by sinus tachycardia at the peak of the exercise. Monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) is often due to myocardial scarring. Polymorphic tachycardia may indicate ischemia, which reinforces the need for further investigation according to the specific guidelines.

Atrial Fibrillation and Flutter\nAF is the most common sustained tachyarrhythmia and its prevalence increases with age. Patients who present a previous diagnosis of AF with adequate clinical control, considering symptoms and basal heart rate, do not need special considerations, except recommendations on anticoagulation (see item 7.D). In the preoperative period of elective surgeries, \u03b2-blockers or non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (verapamil and diltiazem) are essential to control heart rate when patients have persistent AF/Flutter with high ventricular response. Administration of these drugs should preferably be performed slowly to avoid hypotension, which is known to be deleterious postoperatively. Calcium channel blockers may cause depression of myocardial function, particularly in patients with structural cardiopathy. Digoxin may be attenuated by surgical hyperadrenergic condition. There are specific situations, such as pre-excited AF, in which ablation can be considered before surgery. It should be noted that patients with AF with ventricular response above 120 bpm have a severe cardiovascular condition. In these cases, surgery should be postponed until the heart rate is controlled. Control of rhythm, i.e., reversal of AF, could be an option before the procedure, depending on the symptoms and specific evaluation by cardiologists based on the current guidelines. However, interruption of anticoagulation for the procedure could only be performed after 4 weeks, and perioperative adrenergic stress facilitates recurrence.

The AF preventive measures are adequate hydroelectrolytic control in the pre- and postoperative periods (normovolemia, magnesium and potassium monitoring, and replacement), in addition to maintenance of drugs previously used if hemodynamically tolerated. Some drugs have been investigated to reduce the incidence of POAF and its deleterious consequences. Preventive antiarrhythmic therapy with amiodarone or venous magnesium should be discussed individually. Retrospective studies showed that the use of amiodarone for anesthetic induction in patients submitted to esophagectomy may reduce the rate of POAF, but did not reduce the mortality and hospitalization rates. Moreover, its use in patients submitted to pulmonary resection is associated with reduced POAF and decreased time in ICU. Riber et al. conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. They demonstrated that administration of 300 mg of intravenous amiodarone in the early postoperative period, followed by 1200 mg of oral drug per day for 5 days, in hemodynamically stable patients reduced the POAF rate (9% versus 32% in the control group).

Hereditary Arrhythmias\nGenetically determined arrhythmias are a heterogeneous group of diseases and may occur due to defects in ion channels (channelopathies). Protein defects lead to atrial or ventricular arrhythmias, which may be manifested by tachycardic palpitations, arrhythmic characteristic syncope, or sudden death. The most prevalent channelopathies are Brugada Syndrome (1:5,000) and Long QT Syndrome (1:5,000). Other rarer diseases are catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and short QT syndrome.

Safe Cardiac Stimulation\nFor elective noncardiac surgeries, patients should be evaluated by their CIED physicians, which will perform a complete verification of the stimulation system. The physician will determine the need for special programming, report the care that should be taken by the surgeon and anesthesiologist, and describe the possible behaviors of the CIED during surgery or even indicate the need for a stimulus during the procedure to make necessary perioperative schedules, which is usually required in patients at higher risk and with more complex CIED, such as defibrillators. The biggest concern usually involves those patients scheduled for major surgeries with the use of electric scalpels. In such cases, a safety evaluation must be performed always in a pacemaker evaluation unit and by a qualified physician. The physician should program the pacemaker in asynchronous mode only in cases where the patient depends on pacing and has no arrhythmia history (avoiding competition between pacemaker pace and self-pacing). The physician should also advise the surgical team to use bipolar or ultrasonic scalpel when possible, as these types of devices interfere less with the CIED. The report should contain at least the recommendations described below for surgeries without the presence of the physician who programmed the pacemaker: Continuous cardiac monitoring with an ECG and a pulse oximeter (heart rhythm monitoring is possible even when using an electric scalpel).Use a bipolar electric scalpel. If it is not possible, use a unipolar scalpel and place the dispersive electrode (scalpel plate) away from the pacemaker (see below). Subsequently, prepare the skin in the region and eliminate oils by using an alcohol. If the dispersive electrode is reusable, apply a thin and homogeneous layer of electrolytic paste on its surface.The dispersive electrode should be placed away from the CIED, preferably close to the surgical region to minimize the electric field. Thus, in an abdominal or pelvic surgery, the dispersive electrode should be placed close to the coccyx; in a right-hand surgery, the dispersive electrode should be placed on the right forearm; and in a head surgery, the dispersive electrode should be placed on the neck (nape). The CIED and its electrodes should be always away from the electric field generated by the electric scalpel.Ground the scalpel by connecting it to an efficient ground wire.Limit the use of the electric scalpel as much as possible to short and irregular intervals and evaluate the ECG or pulse. During this procedure, the ECG monitor is usually unreadable. Monitoring can be performed using plethysmography, which does not interfere with the electric scalpel.If bradycardia or tachycardia occurs while using the electric scalpel (due to electromagnetic interference), place a magnet on the pacemaker every time the electric scalpel is used and then remove it immediately. The magnetic response of each pacemaker may be different and it may not exist in some cases (if it was programmed to be turned off). A good practice is to perform a few tests before surgery, but the patient must be continuously monitored to observe the magnetic response of the device. In addition, the magnetic behavior of each patient\u2019s pacemaker should be reported by the specialist physician, as this depends on the program of the device. In defibrillators, placing a magnet on the device may turn off antitachycardia therapies, leaving the patient unprotected.The patient should be advised to return to the pacemaker assessment clinic after the postoperative recovery period so that the normal set-up of the generator is re-established and the pacemaker functions are re-evaluated. In patients with resynchronizers, the presence of a greater number of electrodes in the heart undeniably increases the possibility of complications due to external interferences on the stimulation system. Most stimulation electrodes used in the venous system of the left ventricle are used in unipolar mode. Therefore, they are more susceptible to external interferences, particularly those produced by the electric scalpel. However, there is a current trend of using bipolar and even multi-polar electrodes. Notably, many unipolar implants that have already been implanted will remain active for many years. The presence of more electrodes and unipolar electrodes forces physicians to take rigorous measures and pay more attention to signs of interference in the multisite stimulation system.", "type": "Document"}

Emergency Electrical Cardioversion or Defibrillation\nDuring the perioperative period, patients with CIED may present complications that require application of electrical cardioversion or defibrillation. Although generators can theoretically withstand shocks, it is advisable to avoid them whenever possible.172 When necessary, some care should be taken to preserve the pacemaker or defibrillator, the electrodes, and the heart-electrode interface, as described below: If the patient has an implantable defibrillator, internal cardioversion is recommended because it uses a small amount of energy, biphasic pulse, and internal safety features of the device itself.For external shocks, prefer biphasic cardioverters with adhesive pads. Place them in an anteroposterior position (embracing the left ventricle) in accordance to the polarity given by the manufacturer. The classic arrangement of the pads (between the base and tip of the heart - parallel to the electrodes) should be avoided because of the risk of myocardial injury due to contact with the electrode tip.Adhere the pads in the chest as far as possible from the generator and the electrodes.Use as little energy as possible. Modern biphasic external cardioverters should be preferred, whenever possible, because they use less energy;Place a magnet over the pacemaker generator. Older pacemakers invariably switch off when a magnet is placed over them and become asynchronous. In current devices, the magnetic response is programmable and may exhibit different behavior. Therefore, placing a magnet over the generator does not guarantee protection during cardioversion.Placing a magnet over the ICD is not recommended because the antitachycardic function can be switched off if it remains over the ICD for more than 30 seconds.After the procedure, re-evaluate the sensitivity and command thresholds. Consider reassessing the device in 24 hours, and monitor the patient during this period.", "type": "Document"}

Lithotripsy\nShocks generated by lithotripsy have been related to transitory events of loss of sensitivity and command of the CIED, as well as reversion to the safe mode; however, these situations are extremely rare. When lithotripsy is required in patients with pacemaker and/or defibrillator, direct the focus away from the area of the apparatus and electrodes. Turn off atrial stimulation when ECG-triggered lithotripsy is used to avoid the device from synchronization with the atrium. Programming the atrial channel with less energy and in the bipolar mode may be another option, keeping the bicameral stimulation more physiological. A test can be performed before the application to observe the behavior and the interaction of the devices. Do not immerse the part of the body that contains the pacemaker or ICD when performing immersion lithotripsy. It is also recommended to monitor the patient throughout the procedure and, whenever possible, the physician should stay in the room with the CIED programmer to adjust the program of the device as needed. Since lithotripsy is usually outpatient, the patient may perform a regular assessment of the CIED and the specialist can be requested to provide specific guidelines for the procedure.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging\nMagnetic resonance imaging should not be performed on patients with older CIEDs. There is a risk of dysfunction of the prosthesis, electrodes, and even displacement due to the magnetic field generated. The recent advancement of the CIED industry has led to the production of devices that support the field of resonance, including tests of the chest area with a field strength of up to 1.5 Tesla. In this case, both the CIED and electrodes need to be compatible with this technology. Some patients with new devices but with old electrodes (connected or abandoned) could not undergo magnetic resonance imaging. Despite the development in this field, even patients with CIED and compatible electrodes require the presence of a physician and a programmer during the test because a specific program is required, which should be deactivated at the end of the procedure. The most appropriate recommendations in these cases are previous evaluation of the patient in a pacemaker evaluation unit and guidance from the specialist on whether the patient should undergo testing. It is important to note that not only the images present artifacts due to the presence of the prosthesis but the patient may also experience local discomfort. This local discomfort is frequently described as burning and palpitations or dizziness related to inhibitions/deflagrations of the CIED.", "type": "Document"}

If the irradiated site is located exactly in the region of the implant or very close to it and many radiotherapy sessions are necessary, reimplantation of the CIED away from the irradiation site should be evaluated. Direct radiotherapy on the CIED may cause transient or definitive dysfunction of the device and premature battery wear. Each radiotherapy application may put the CIED in safety mode, even if local protection measures are taken; thus, evaluation of the CIED is required after each radiotherapy session. Electrodes may also be affected with radiotherapy, especially at the site of contact with the endocardium, which may suffer fibrosis and loss of control. This phenomenon can occur from days to months after radiotherapy. Therefore, particular attention should be given to these patients, especially those that depend on stimulation.

Dental Procedures\nDental procedures in patients with CIEDs are increasingly common in dental practice. In addition to the risk of infection in prostheses, interaction between the equipment used in the dental treatment and the CIED, particularly the electric scalpel, is also possible. In this situation, care taken should be the same as covered in item 4.G.III for general surgeries. In patients with ICD, the device may interpret the thermocautery interference as an arrhythmia and release low- or high-energy therapy, placing both the patient and the dental surgeon at risk of receiving an inappropriate shock. Placing a magnet on the generator does not provide adequate protection and should be avoided. In dental procedures, where the use of thermocautery is mandatory and the patient has ICD, it is essential to disable the antitachycardia therapy, keeping only the pacemaker function. To prevent untreated risk of arrhythmias in this condition, the patient should be monitored and an external defibrillator should be available on site. The decision to perform the procedure in a hospital environment should always be considered due to the presence of necessary equipment for electrical emergencies, besides the support of the arrhythmologist. General, simple, and routine dentistry procedures carried out in dental practices do not require additional precaution, in addition to the usual therapeutic recommendations. Analgesia should be effective, and the use of anesthetics with vasoconstrictors at recommended doses (vasoconstrictor concentration and amount) should not be avoided.

Liver\nLiver transplantation remains the procedure of choice for the treatment of terminal liver disease. However, changes occurring both intraoperatively and post-transplantation have increased the existing cardiovascular morbidity in these patients. This may be due to several risk factors that affect the population of the same age group (such as age, diabetes, male gender, smoking, previous history of CAD) or it may be related to liver disease and its etiology, such as alcohol-related cardiomyopathy, deposition of amyloid substances, and alterations due to cirrhosis-associated cardiomyopathy. Studies have shown that cardiac events can occur in up to 70% of post-transplant patients, depending on the criteria. Among the most common are arrhythmias, pulmonary edema, and systolic ventricular dysfunction, but sudden death and myocardial infarction may also occur. Therefore, careful investigation of heart disease in candidates for liver transplantation is required. However, due to liver disease, cardiological investigation in these patients is difficult because the hemodynamic changes and limitations resulting from the disease do not allow the same sensitivity and specificity in cardiology tests, when compared to other populations. Approximately 50% of patients with cirrhosis show an increase in the QT interval. \u03b2-adrenergic receptors respond only slightly to sympathetic stimuli, leading to dubious responses in studies of dobutamine echocardiography. The hyperdynamic state and its consequent chronic vasodilatation impair the vasodilator-induced response, such as dipyridamole in myocardial scintigraphy. Terminal liver disease is often accompanied by renal dysfunction, which impairs the use of contrast agents, such as in coronary angiography or coronary Angio-CT. However, there are tests and approaches that have become routinely used in the preoperative evaluation of liver transplant candidates due to their cost-effectiveness.

Although CAD increases the morbidity and mortality of these patients, the degree of impairment of stenosis does not seem to correlate with worse prognosis. Computerized coronary tomography with quantification of the calcium score has been recently shown to be useful, and a calcium score above 400 has a high predictive value for early cardiovascular events in these patients. However, the use of this test cannot be routinely indicated for this population. The choice of treatment for these patients should consider that lack of intervention may lead to an excessive risk during and after surgery. However, the best treatment is not established and should be customized for each patient. An important controversy concerns the use of drug eluting stents that requires antiplatelet agents for a longer time in patients with thrombocytopenia, and the risk of bleeding is always present. Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) should be, whenever possible, postponed until after transplantation because of the high probability of hemorrhagic events or worsening of the hepatic condition with the surgery. Myocardial revascularization before the transplant should be only performed in patients for whom the risk of death due to CAD exceeds the risk of death due to liver disease.

Kidney\nPatients with terminal renal disease are one of the highest cardiovascular risk groups, with mortality rates from cardiovascular disease 5 to 100 times higher than those found in the general population. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death after renal transplantation, particularly due to CAD. In the first 30 days after successful kidney transplantation, approximately half of the deaths are due to MI. Similarly, in the late follow-up, chronic ischemic heart disease accounts for more than a third of deaths in patients with a functioning graft. Therefore, the preoperative evaluation of renal transplant candidates aims not only to reduce cardiovascular risk in the short term, related to the surgical procedure, but also to reduce cardiovascular events in late follow-up. During the evaluation of renal transplant candidates, the identification and presence of CAD are of fundamental importance because they allow the medical team to establish more precisely the risk-benefit of transplantation, the possible need for coronary intervention in the preoperative period, the use of cardioprotective measures in the perioperative period, and the control of risk factors in the postoperative period. This section aims to provide the cardiologist with the most appropriate methods to determine cardiovascular risk in a very special population of patients, almost always excluded from the risk stratification studies. The main aim is to identify those most likely to be diagnosed with CAD among kidney transplant candidates. Thus, the recommendations included in this section should be applied only to asymptomatic patients or patients with atypical symptoms. For those individuals with clinical evidence and/or diagnostic investigations suggestive of coronary disease, further investigation and treatment should follow the proposed rules for the general population. Identification of relevant CAD is challenging in renal transplant candidates. Patients with terminal renal disease often have atypical symptoms, or are even asymptomatic, in the presence of advanced CAD. The use of non-invasive methods, such as exercise ECG testing, MPS, and stress echocardiography, all routinely performed in the general population has lower sensitivity and specificity than in individuals with normal renal function, providing numerous false negative results. On the other hand, coronary angiography should not be performed indiscriminately because it is an invasive method, with risk of complications and high cost. In addition, the prevalence of significant CAD in patients routinely assessed invasively is less than 50%. Observational studies show that patients with terminal chronic kidney disease and CAD undergoing PCI or CABG have a risk of cardiovascular events similar to those with terminal chronic kidney disease without significant CAD. Those with obstructive coronary disease who did not undergo myocardial revascularization had significantly higher rates of cardiovascular events. Therefore, it is necessary to define a strategy that allows identification of patients more likely to have relevant CAD and who should therefore be referred for angiographic study. With this, we would reduce the number of patients inadequately classified as being of low cardiovascular risk due to failure in the preoperative risk stratification and consequently their exposure to a higher risk of cardiovascular events.", "type": "Document"}

Interventions and Procedures with Specific Features in the Perioperative Period > B) Bariatric Surgery\nWith the obesity epidemic and the increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes, bariatric or metabolic surgical interventions have become a very interesting option. The results of long-term (though not randomized) studies seem to indicate the benefit of these interventions in reducing mortality. However, there are still many uncertainties, in particular, which patient profile may benefit and what type of surgical intervention to perform for each case. Once the bariatric surgical procedure is considered, it is important to pay attention to the contraindications for this type of surgery: type 1 diabetes, drug or alcohol abuse, uncontrolled psychiatric disease, lack of understanding about risks, alternatives, and complications of the intervention, and lack of commitment to the need for nutritional supplementation and clinical follow-up. In Brazil, four different types of bariatric surgery (besides the intragastric balloon, which is not considered surgical) are approved: gastric bypass, adjustable gastric band, duodenal switch, and vertical gastrectomy. However, there are no conclusive data to support the selection of procedure based, for example, on the higher or lower incidence of complications. On the other hand, several variables, such as age, gender, BMI, presence of comorbidities, and the patient\u2019s desire, should be considered. Thus, for example, the presence of important hiatal hernia contraindicates vertical gastrectomy, the patient with a very high BMI cannot receive an adjustable gastric banding, vertical gastrectomy is less efficient in a patient who continually eats, or gastric bypass will probably work better if the patient is a long-term diabetic. Regarding the perioperative evaluation for patients with indication for bariatric surgery, in addition to the general recommendations described for obese patients in another item of this guideline (item 9 D), there are some specific considerations that consider studies that observed the occurrence of complications. DeMaria et al. evaluated 2,075 patients undergoing bariatric surgery (all undergoing gastric bypass) using the obesity surgery mortality risk stratification score and found increased risk of death in the presence of certain factors: pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) or risk for PTE, BMI > 50 kg/m2, male gender, systemic arterial hypertension, and > 45 years of age. The risk for PTE was defined as previous PTE, presence of a vena cava filter, right HF and/or PH, chronic venous stasis, and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Basing on these data, the authors developed a risk score based on the number of risk factors: A (0-1), B (2-3), and C (4-5), which correspond to an estimated perioperative mortality risk of 0.31, 1.90, and 7.56%, respectively. Patients undergoing bariatric surgery in the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) of the USA were evaluated. Tools were developed and validated for mortality and morbidity risk, specifically for this type of intervention, and this can be accessed and used online: http://www.surgicalriskcalculator.com/bariatric-surgery-risk-calculator The largest prospective study performed to date is the longitudinal assessment of bariatric surgery (LABS), with results published in July 2009. A total of 4,776 bariatric surgical interventions were analyzed, and lower complication rates were observed, which is not in agreement with the findings of DeMaria et al. The authors found a general mortality rate of 0.3% in a period of 30 days and an outcome composed of death, deep venous thrombosis (DVT), PTE, reintervention, and hospitalization > 30 days in 4.3% of the patients. Some predictors of the outcome were similar to those found by DeMaria, such as BMI > 70 kg/m2, DVT or prior PTE (8.8% of events), and sleep apnea (5.0% of events). The authors also found a correlation between the outcome and diabetes (5.5% of events), and type of surgery and low functional capacity (inability to walk more than 61 meters without dyspnea with 15.9% of events). In this study, the type of surgery with the best outcome was laparoscopic gastric banding (1.0%) compared to laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (4.8%) and open surgery Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (7.8%). Another study with more than 91,000 patients observed that venous thromboembolism occurred in the first 30 days postoperatively in 0.29% of the cases of obese patients undergoing bariatric or metabolic surgery. However, more than 80% of the cases of thromboembolism occurred after hospital discharge. HF, paraplegia, dyspnea at rest, and resurgery were associated with a higher risk of thromboembolism. The authors suggested that routine pharmacological thromboprophylaxis should be considered for high-risk patients (> 0.4%). However, there is no consensus with regard to the most appropriate prophylactic measure. A recent meta-analysis found no benefit for any of the different strategies, with enoxaparion ranging from 40 mg per day to 60 mg twice a day. On the other hand, a study analyzed the strategy of dividing the groups of patients submitted to bariatric surgery (93% gastric bypass) according to the BMI, administering 40 mg twice a day to the group with BMI lower than or equal to 50 kg/m2 and 60 mg twice a day to the group with BMI > 50 kg/m2. The study reported that 74% of the patients reached anti-Xa therapeutic levels and only 1.79% needed blood transfusion.

Local Anesthetics: to Use or Not to Use Local Vasoconstrictors\nThe use of local anesthetics with vasoconstrictors in patients with heart disease has generated controversy. The administration of vasoconstrictors in combination with local anesthetics increases the quality and duration of pain control and promotes reduction of bleeding. Local anesthetic without vasoconstrictor has a short duration, rapid absorption (high toxic potential), and inadequate pain control. It can also generate hemodynamic changes and even cardiac arrhythmias, besides promoting mild vasodilation, increasing bleeding.

Although the interaction of epinephrine with \u03b2-blockers, tricyclic antidepressants, diuretics, and cocaine has been reported in the literature, the use of two to three 2.0% lidocaine tubes with 1:100,000 epinephrine (36-54 \u00b5g epinephrine) is well tolerated in most patients. This also applies to individuals with hypertension or other cardiovascular disease, situations where the use of this vasoconstrictor has more benefits than risks.", "type": "Document"}

Patients Using Antithrombotic Agents (Antiplatelet Agents and Oral Anticoagulants)\nMost dental procedures have low risk of bleeding. Therefore, warfarin should not be discontinued in most patients submitted to dental procedures, including dental extractions. A meta-analysis and smaller studies have demonstrated safety in performing dental procedures in anticoagulated patients with international normalized ratio (INR) < 4.0 by using local measures to reduce bleeding. Major procedures, and consequently with greater risk of bleeding, such as extraction > 3 teeth, should have customized discussion based on the thrombotic risk of each patient to determine interruption of therapy and possible bridge therapy, as discussed in specific section in this guideline. To date, evidence of bleeding risk in patients using new anticoagulants (NOACs) in dental procedures is limited. There are also no recommendations available for perioperative measures. Regarding antiplatelet agents, several studies in the literature show the safety of performing dental procedures usually using aspirin or clopidogrel monotherapy. Although bleeding increases, this is easily controlled with local hemostatic measures. Therefore, patients in secondary prevention of cardiovascular events using aspirin or clopidogrel monotherapy should keep using the drugs in the perioperative period of the procedures. Patients on DAPT with a recent PCI (6 weeks after bare metal stent (BMS) and 6 months after drug eluting stent - DES) or acute coronary syndrome for less than one year should maintain the use of the drugs, if dental procedures are required in the period of highest risk of intra-stent thrombosis. There is already evidence in the literature on the safety of this strategy when local hemostatic measures are increased. Studies with ticagrelor or prasugrel remain scarce, but the recommendation is to maintain them in these conditions of DAPT in periods of increased risk of intra-stent thrombosis.

Dermatological\nDermatological surgical procedures are low-risk procedures for both cardiovascular and bleeding events. Data from the literature suggest that approximately 50% of patients scheduled for dermatological procedures are using antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy. In these cases, the surgical team and the anesthesiologist should be informed about the drugs used and the necessary care, including a more time-consuming and cautious hemostasis, because in most cases the risk associated with discontinuation of antithrombotic therapy outweighs the risk of bleeding inherent in the procedure. Suspension of the use of aspirin for secondary prevention of cardiovascular events is not necessary before performing any dermatological surgical intervention. For patients using double antiplatelet therapy for stent implantation who are not in the period of greatest thrombotic risk, the recommendation is to suspend the second antiplatelet drug, considering the intervals already described in this guideline (see section on antiplatelet agents - item 7.A.V). For individuals taking warfarin, the recommendation is to continue its use and adjust the INR to \u2264 3.5 to minimize the risk of bleeding. However, some studies have not demonstrated the correlation between INR levels and the risk of increased bleeding in patients taking warfarin. Although evidence is scarce, it is recommended that patients taking one of the new oral anticoagulants (NOACs) can perform most of the dermatological procedures during the medications.

For procedures considered as high risk of bleeding, some points should be considered. Patients taking DAPT for a recent PCI (6 weeks after BMS stent and 6 months after DES) or acute coronary syndrome in the past year present the highest risk if antiplatelet therapy is discontinued.

Ophthalmologic\nOphthalmologic surgical interventions are relatively frequent procedures in the elderly population. The presence of cardiovascular comorbidities that require the use of antithrombotic drugs and their associated treatment during the perioperative period is a subject of intense debate between ophthalmological surgeons and cardiologists. In Brazil, the fear of hemorrhagic complications, including bruising in the periorbital region, is responsible for the indiscriminate interruption of aspirin and warfarin in 82.7% of patients who undergo glaucoma surgeries. The limited evidence regarding the occurrence of complications shows that this fear is not reasonable. The rate of hemorrhagic complications described in observational studies is low and without major consequences, particularly in cataract surgeries using conventional anesthetic techniques. Some ophthalmologic surgical interventions, such as trabeculectomy and vitrectomy, which are used to treat glaucoma and retinal diseases, respectively, present a greater hemorrhagic risk. Nevertheless, the evidence does not demonstrate an increased risk of significant hemorrhagic complications in these surgeries with the use of aspirin. In such cases, the decision should be customized, but maintaining this agent is generally recommended in the perioperative period. Patients receiving a DAPT for a recent PCI (6 weeks after BMS stent and 6 months after DES) or acute coronary syndrome in the past year are those at highest risk of events due to discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy. Therefore, ophthalmologic procedures, whenever possible, should be postponed until this period of greatest risk ends. For procedures that required to be performed in this period, the strategy depends on the hemorrhagic risk of the intervention. For interventions with low hemorrhagic risk (intravitreal injections, cataract, and peribulbar anesthesia), aspirin and P2Y12 receptor inhibitors should be maintained. For interventions with higher hemorrhagic risk, such as vitrectomy and trabulectomy, the most accepted recommendation is the maintenance of aspirin and suspension of the second antiplatelet, considering the intervals already described in a specific section of this guideline (item 7.A.V.C). However, the evidence for this strategy is limited. Similar to patients taking ASA monotherapy, evidence in the literature favors the maintenance of clopidogrel monotherapy in the perioperative period of cataract surgeries. Evidence is more limited in glaucoma and retinal surgeries. The recommendation is to suspend clopidogrel in the perioperative period of these interventions, considering the 5-day period between the suspension and the procedure. With regard to patients taking warfarin, the evidence in the literature favors their maintenance in surgeries with lower hemorrhagic risk, such as cataract surgeries, ensuring that the INR is in the therapeutic range. A meta-analysis of observational studies including patients submitted to cataract surgery and using warfarin found a bleeding incidence of around 10%. This incidence was mostly self-limiting, subconjunctival, and with no visual loss. On the contrary, in glaucoma and retinal disease surgeries, warfarin should be discontinued. Perioperative management should follow the strategy described in this guideline in the perioperative anticoagulation management section (item 7.D), considering the individual risk of thrombotic events of the patients. To date, evidence of risk of bleeding during ophthalmologic surgeries in patients using new anticoagulants (NOACs) is limited. No recommendations have been established for their perioperative management. Recommendations, particularly for patients with coronary stents and mechanical valvular prostheses, should be customized, considering the relationship between thrombotic and hemorrhagic risks. For patients recommended to maintain anticoagulant and/or antiplatelet agents, the surgeon should be informed of the need to ensure adequate hemostasis. A suggestion that can be considered and discussed with the anesthesiologist, who makes the final decision, is the use of a specific type of anesthesia that is less associated with hemorrhagic complications. For antiplatelets, if the decision is to interrupt the drug, it should be restarted postoperatively as soon as possible. In addition, the procedure must be performed in a hospital with competence for urgent hemodynamic intervention (PCI), if necessary.", "type": "Document"}

Measures to Reduce Surgical Risk from a Cardiovascular Perspective > A) Perioperative Drug Therapy > I. \u03b2-blockers\nThe recommendations regarding the use of \u03b2-blockers in the perioperative period of noncardiac surgical interventions have been under intense debate in recent years because of the results of large clinical studies. These studies presented limitations that generate discussions in the academic and care communities. Pioneering studies in the 1990s suggested that perioperative use of \u03b2-blockers could reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in a broad spectrum of patients. Three randomized trials conducted between 2005 and 2006 did not confirm the protective effect of \u03b2-blockers in the vascular perioperative period of low- or intermediate-risk patients, highlighting the potential harm, given the association with a higher incidence of bradycardia and hypotension. The benefit of \u03b2-blockers was later questioned in meta-analyses. On the other hand, the largest retrospective study on the use of \u03b2-blockers in the perioperative period, which analyzed more than 780,000 patients submitted to noncardiac surgery, showed that the impact of \u03b2-blockers depends on the estimation of cardiac risk. In high-risk patients, \u03b2-blockers are associated with lower mortality, whereas in low-risk patients, no benefit was found and the \u03b2-blockers could be harmful. In 2008, the POISE study was conducted. In this study, 8,351 patients who were mostly having an intermediate risk of complications were randomized to receive metoprolol succinate or placebo starting 2-4 hours prior to noncardiac surgery, with doses up to 400 mg in the first 24 hours. The results showed a lower incidence of MI, reversed cardiac arrest, and cardiac mortality in the group with \u03b2-blockers. However, the authors observed two times higher incidence of stroke and greater overall mortality in this group. The high incidence of hypotension and bradycardia was strongly associated with higher mortality and stroke. Careful analysis of these data shows a great heterogeneity among studies, mainly regarding the dosage of \u03b2-blockers used and time of onset. There are studies that initiated \u03b2-blockers a few hours before the surgery, with no time to determine the doses conferring adequate heart rate control. In other studies, some patients continued to receive \u03b2-blockers despite the occurrence of bradycardia and/or hypotension and most importantly without time for hemodynamic adaptation. On the other hand, there are studies that started \u03b2-blockers earlier, at least one week before the surgery, to determine the adequate dose. These were the studies that showed benefit. In 2008, even before the publication of the POISE study, an interesting publication reviewed data from the two main meta-analyses previously cited based on the heart rate control obtained for each study. The authors divided the data into two groups according to degree of heart rate control, and observed that the trials in which patients achieve the most effective control of heart rate were associated with a reduced incidence of postoperative MI, suggesting that effective control of heart rate is important for achieving cardioprotection. Thus, once the specific indications have been evaluated, the use of \u03b2-blockers in the perioperative period must always comply with safety principles. The time of onset should be as early as possible (at least one week before the surgery) to ensure adequate time to evaluate the hemodynamic response of each patient, avoiding bradycardia and hypotension. Low doses should be prescribed, with progressive titration to a HR of 55 to 65 bpm, without hypotension (SBP > 100 mmHg). During the perioperative period, frequent monitoring of HR and BP must be done. If HR < 50 bpm or SBP < 100 mmHg is detected, the \u03b2-blockers should be suspended until hemodynamic and chronotropic balance is restored. On the other hand, from the point of view of effectiveness, the benefit of the \u03b2-blockers is associated with adequate heart rate control. Therefore, we should target for a HR of 55 to 65 bpm in the pre- and postoperative periods. Finally, \u03b2-blockers should not be withdraw in the perioperative period of patients who receive them chronically for various indications. Acute \u03b2-blocker suspension is associated with a significant increase in postoperative mortality.", "type": "Document"}

Measures to Reduce Surgical Risk from a Cardiovascular Perspective > A) Perioperative Drug Therapy > II. Statins\nIn addition to reducing cholesterol levels, statins have a pleiotropic effect of reducing inflammation and stabilizing plaques of atherosclerosis. The use of statins to prevent cardiovascular events after vascular surgeries is well established and is based on prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled studies. In 2004, in the first randomized study published, the authors demonstrated that the use of 20 mg of atorvastatin is associated with a large decrease in major cardiovascular events (death, MI, stroke, unstable angina) in the perioperative period and after 6 months of follow-up. This effect occurred regardless of baseline cholesterol levels. In 2009, the use of 80 mg of slow-release fluvastatin in 250 patients submitted to vascular surgeries was shown to reduce the occurrence of postoperative myocardial ischemia and the combined outcome of MI and cardiac death in a period of 30 days compared to the placebo group (247 patients). This result was confirmed in a recent meta-analysis involving 23,536 patients, in which the use of statins in the perioperative vascular period reduces overall mortality and MI and stroke rates. The specific benefits of statins for each type of vascular procedure can be found in a specific guideline for vascular surgeries. The administration of 20 mg of atorvastatin (or 40 mg of simvastatin) in patients submitted to vascular surgery should be preferably performed two weeks before the procedure and maintained for 30 days. Subsequently, the dose should be adjusted to the individual LDL goal of each patient. On the other hand, evidence on the use of statins for the prevention of cardiovascular complications in nonvascular surgeries is obtained from retrospective studies. Lindenauer et al. evaluated 780,591 patients submitted to noncardiac surgeries (92% nonvascular surgeries) in a retrospective cohort study with 77,082 patients (9.9%) receiving statins. In this study, the patients who received statins had lower mortality during hospital stays. Another retrospective case-control study with only nonvascular surgeries, including 989 patients who died postoperatively within 30 days and 1879 controls, showed that the use of statins is also associated with a reduction in mortality (OR = 0.4; CI 0.24-0.68). In a retrospective cohort that included 752 patients submitted to nonvascular surgeries, the authors demonstrated a reduction in the combined outcome of nonfatal MI, AF, and mortality in a period of 30 days in patients using statins. Recently, in an analysis of the patients included in the VISION study, Berwanger et al. evaluated 2,842 patients receiving statins and 4,492 patients without statins. They compared the occurrence of mortality, isolated elevation of troponin levels (defined as troponin increased levels, without MI or other cause), and stroke in a period of 30 days by using propensity score matching. About 10% of the patients were submitted to vascular surgeries and the rest to nonvascular procedures. Patients receiving statins showed reduction in the risk of the combined outcome (RR 0.83; 95% CI 0.73-0.95; p = 0.007). The use of statins reduced overall mortality (RR 0.58; 95% CI 0.40-0.83; p = 0.003), cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.23-0.76; p = 0.004), and the occurrence of isolated increase of troponin levels (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.73-0.98; p = 0.02). There was no reduction in noncardiovascular mortality and in the rate of MI or stroke. It should be noted that, despite propensity score matching, the patients in the statin group had CAD, diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, aspirin use, and ACE inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers more frequently than the patients in the group without statins. Although presenting more risk factors, the patients in the statin group had fewer cardiovascular events. Basing on these studies, we can conclude that the patients with higher cardiovascular risk and those using statins due to comorbidities (CAD, diabetes, peripheral vascular disease) may benefit with the administration of statins in perioperative nonvascular surgeries. Statins are often withdraw postoperatively. The main reasons for statin withdrawal are as follows: postoperative ileus and inability to administer oral medications, hemodynamic instability, concern with the occurrence of side effects, and lack of awareness of the importance of maintaining statins. Perioperative statin suspension in patients who use this medication on a chronic basis is an independent predictor of cardiovascular events following vascular surgeries. The use of statins in the perioperative period is safe. Although patients using statins have a higher baseline CPK level, the occurrence of increases above 5 times their reference value or rhabdomyolysis is rare. Therefore, in patients who already use statins, it should be maintained in the perioperative period.", "type": "Document"}

Alpha-agonists\nAlpha2-agonists modulate the response of catecholamines to surgery and anesthesia, decreasing the release of noradrenaline and reducing blood pressure and heart rate.

On the other hand, a meta-analysis demonstrated that \u03b12-agonists reduce mortality and MI in patients submitted to vascular surgeries, but not in those submitted to nonvascular surgeries.

Acetylsalicylic Acid\nPOISE-2 study, which was published in 2014, is the largest randomized, placebo-controlled study evaluating the impact of ASA in the perioperative period. In this study, 10,010 patients with risk factors for perioperative complications receiving ASA or placebo were evaluated. Patients who never took ASA were included, as well as patients who were already on chronic use, randomized to placebo, or continued ASA at the study doses of 200 mg immediately prior to surgery and 100 mg daily for 30 days. The authors did not show a significant difference in the primary outcome (death or MI) or in the secondary outcome of the study (death, MI or stroke). No difference was observed based on the history of use of pre-randomization ASA. On the other hand, they observed a higher incidence of bleeding in the ASA group: 4.6% \u00d7 3.8%, p = 0.04, especially at the surgical site. Some considerations should be made regarding the clinical profile of patients who mostly (almost 70% of the population) had no history of cardiovascular disease and used ASA for primary prevention. Another extremely relevant fact is the non-inclusion of patients with PCI with DES in the last year or BMS in the last 6 weeks. Most surgeries in the study were orthopedic, general, or gynecological, with 605 vascular procedures, for which the main results of the study are maintained. Thus, the most practical applicability of POISE-2 results is to recommend the non-use of ASA in the perioperative period of individuals in primary prevention. For patients who are already using ASA for primary prevention and are scheduled for noncardiac surgery, suspension of antiplatelet treatment 7 days before is recommended. Oscarsson et al. conducted a much smaller study than POISE-2. It included 210 patients. The study design was interesting because it did not investigate the initiation of ASA, but the suspension or maintenance in the noncardiac perioperative period of patients chronically using ASA. Patients scheduled for vascular surgeries were not included (the authors thought that it was unethical to withdraw the antiplatelet treatment in the vascular perioperative period). They observed a lower incidence of cardiovascular events in the group that maintained ASA, without a higher incidence of bleeding. Anecdotally, the subjective notion of the surgeon on the bleeding tendency due to impaired hemostasis during the surgery did not allow discriminating patients receiving placebo or antiplatelets. In the STRATAGEM study, the patients using ASA only for secondary cardiovascular prevention were randomized to receive 75 mg of ASA or placebo in the perioperative period. The results showed no increased incidence of bleeding or significant difference in thrombotic complications. However, this study included only 20% of the planned patients, which hinders definitive conclusions for patients at higher risk. In the vascular perioperative period, evidence suggests the beneficial use of ASA for protection of infrainguinal grafts, but without conclusion about systemic outcomes. On the other hand, Calderaro et al. analyzed patients in the elective vascular perioperative who were already on chronic use of ASA and observed that those individuals with lower platelet responsivity up to 100 mg daily (according to the aggregability test after stimulation with arachidonic acid) presented more than twice the systemic atherothrombotic events, when compared to the more responsive individuals, without an increase in bleeding rate. For patients receiving ASA for secondary prevention, it is recommended to maintain it at a maximum dose of 100 mg daily. Meta-analysis data suggest that this ratio is favorable for most perioperative patients. Neurosurgeries due to high morbidity and mortality associated with bleeding, even small ones, represent an absolute indication for ASA suspension 7 days before. Patients scheduled for transurethral resection of the prostate using the conventional technique should also suspend ASA owing to the high risk of bleeding. Urologists recently acknowledged that ASA can be maintained using the hemostatic technique called laser green-light in patients scheduled for transurethral resection. This example demonstrates the benefit of new techniques for more complex patients and the constant need for a multidisciplinary approach to the perioperative decision process. At present, there is no recommendation for routine ASA withdrawal for transrectal prostate biopsy, an extremely common urological procedure. There is no recommendation to start ASA before noncardiac surgeries. If we evaluate patients with established vascular disease but who erroneously omit using antiplatelets, it is the opinion of this guideline by consensus of the specialists that this therapy should be implemented at the time of hospital discharge. However, no study has supported the administration of the drug before surgery.", "type": "Document"}

Measures to Reduce Surgical Risk from a Cardiovascular Perspective > A) Perioperative Drug Therapy > V. B. Dual Antiplatelet Therapy\nApproximately 20% of patients submitted to PCI will require noncardiac surgery in the subsequent 2 years. This implies perioperative management not only of ASA but also of the second antiplatelet agent (clopidogrel, prasugrel or ticagrelor), particularly in cases with less than one year between interventions. This is a common and quite complex situation because evidence on the safety of maintaining DAPT in the noncardiac perioperative period is scarce and indirect. The evidence is mainly extrapolated from the cardiac surgery data, which reveals a great increase in the rate of bleeding. On the other hand, the potential for treatment suspension is also quite high, especially after PCI, with DAPT suspension being one of the main predictors of stent thrombosis. An interesting study was conducted in France evaluating 1,134 patients with PCI who required subsequent noncardiac surgery. The study identified DAPT suspension for more than 5 days before the surgery as one of the independent predictors of perioperative cardiovascular complications. The best way to deal with DAPT in the perioperative period is to maintain the optimal duration of this therapy and not to perform elective surgeries during this period (see the topic of prophylactic myocardial revascularization in this guideline - item 7.B): 6 weeks after PCI with BMS; 6 months after DES or one year after PCI in the context of acute coronary syndromes. Some elective procedures, such as oncological treatment, cannot be postponed without consequences. In this situation, it is recommended to maintain ASA alone and suspend clopidogrel. Clopidogrel should be suspended 5 days before the surgery and restarted as soon as possible, ideally before completing 10 days without DAPT. The postoperative deadline for restarting the drug depends on adequate hemostasis control and should be individually established between the surgical and clinical teams. Basing on the evidence of relative safety of withdrawal of the second antiplatelet in up to 10 days, we recommend not to exceed a total of 10 days without DAPT outside the perioperative context. Evidence is even scarcer for the newer antiplatelet drugs. The TRITON-TIMI 38 study included patients receiving prasugrel or clopidogrel associated with ASA and requiring cardiac surgery. Prasugrel showed higher rates of bleeding than clopidogrel, even with suspension of clopidogrel or prasugrel for up to 7 days. This observation supports the recommendation to discontinue prasugrel 7 days before noncardiac surgeries. Although pharmacokinetic data support the suspension of ticagrelor for a shorter period, the current recommendation is still 5 days. Sub-analysis of patients who required myocardial revascularization in the PLATO study (patients randomized to ASA + ticagrelor vs. ASA + clopidogrel) demonstrated less bleeding with ticagrelor than with clopidogrel. This finding is in agreement with the idea of a faster platelet activity recovery after suspension of ticagrelor in comparison with clopidogrel. The new drug eluting stents are less thrombogenic; thus, the ideal interval for noncardiac surgery is shortened to 6 months in cases of elective PCI (see specific session of prophylactic myocardial revascularization in this guideline - item 7.B). Notably, maintenance of DAPT can be considered for some procedures performed in compressible sites or by endovascular technique depending on multidisciplinary consensus. Patients at very high risk of stent thrombosis, such as diabetic or with PCI involving grafts, or in the context of acute coronary syndromes or complicated PCI, may be considered for \u201cbridge\u201d therapy with parenteral antiplatelet consisting of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors. There is no recommendation for \u201cbridge\u201d therapy with LMWH because recent clinical evidence has demonstrated the harm of such measure, in addition to the pharmacological need of inhibition of platelet activity rather than coagulation.", "type": "Document"}

Measures to Reduce Surgical Risk from a Cardiovascular Perspective > B) Myocardial Revascularization\nThe first studies that analyzed the role of myocardial revascularization before noncardiac surgery suggested that it could be indicated to reduce perioperative cardiovascular risk. This strategy aimed at reducing the risk of ischemic events related to severe and fixed coronary stenosis(342). Nevertheless, the events related to the instability of atherosclerotic plaques are not reduced. Atherosclerotic plaque rupture is a pathophysiological mechanism known to be involved in the genesis of ischemic events in the perioperative context. Recent evidence in the literature has failed to demonstrate the beneficial role of prophylactic myocardial revascularization (CABG or PCI) in patients with stable CAD in the preoperative period in noncardiac surgeries. In addition, the development of drug therapy and consequent perioperative pharmacoprotection have made the potential benefits of prophylactic myocardial revascularization increasingly restricted. Therefore, indications for preoperative myocardial revascularization in noncardiac surgeries are identical to those outside the perioperative context. The indications aimed not only to reduce perioperative ischemic events but also to improve long-term prognosis. In cases with unequivocal indication of myocardial revascularization in patients who are in the preoperative period of noncardiac surgeries, information, such as clinical stability of the patient, prognosis of the underlying disease that led to the indication of the surgical procedure, and the potential risk of bleeding of this procedure, should be considered in decision-making. In these cases, the interval between myocardial revascularization and noncardiac surgery is an important factor, particularly in cases of PCI. When the surgery must be performed during the endothelization period of the stent, the risk of stent thrombosis and the risk of hemorrhagic complications associated with the use of double antiplatelet therapy increase. In the perioperative period, the French registry of more than 1,000 patients submitted to noncardiac surgery after PCI with stent (DES in one third of them) reaffirmed that one of the main predictors of cardiac complications is the suspension of DAPT more than 5 days before the surgery, regardless of the type of stent. Therefore, elective operations must be performed whenever possible after the end of this high-risk period. In contrast to what we observed in the context of isolated coronary disease, DES present an enormous fear in the perioperative period and a potentially higher risk than BMS because of the greater and more lasting thrombogenicity associated to them. Thus, when noncardiac surgery is required in a near future (formerly a year, with paclitaxel stents or first-generation sirolimus stents), the use of DES is contraindicated. Consequently, when the surgical procedure needs to be performed shortly, PCI with BMS or even balloon PCI without stent should be considered, provided they present favorable primary outcome. With most modern DES, recent evidence suggests that the duration of DAPT can be shortened to 6 months and exceptionally 3 months. On the other hand, when PCI is performed to treat acute coronary syndromes, especially in cases of MI, duration of DAPT should be one year, regardless of the type of stent implanted. Contextualizing these most recent data on shortening the duration of DAPT in the perioperative period, Holcomb et al. demonstrated that the risk of complications following noncardiac surgeries is significantly reduced from the 6th month of PCI with DES. The authors analyzed more than 20,000 cases of noncardiac surgeries after coronary PCI, with approximately half of them with DES. Notably, they also introduced another important concept of interventional treatment of acute coronary disease in the perioperative period. When PCI was performed in the context of MI even after one year, the risk of thrombotic complications is still greater than in cases where PCI was performed electively.", "type": "Document"}

It is important to consider that most hospitalized patients have one or more risk factors for venous thromboembolism and that these factors have a cumulative character ( The incidence of confirmed thromboembolism in hospitalized patients without adequate thromboprophylaxis may vary widely, depending on the type of surgery performed, as outlined in There is strong evidence in the literature that adequate thromboprophylaxis in surgical patients is cost-effective, with an optimal cost-benefit ratio.

Mechanical thromboprophylaxis should be the primary method to prevent VTE in patients at high risk of bleeding. When pharmacological prophylaxis is indicated, the doses recommended by each manufacturer should be followed. In general, we consider the following doses: UFH, 5,000 IU, subcutaneously (SC), 12/12h or 8/8h; LMWH (dalteparin 5,000 IU, SC, 1x/day; tinzaparin 4,500 IU, SC, 1x/day; enoxaparin 40 mg, SC, 1x/day); and fondaparinux, 2.5 mg, SC, 1x/day (in individuals > 50 kg). Aspirin should not be used alone in any group of patients as thromboprophylaxis for VTE. Evaluation of renal function is fundamentally important when considering the use and dose of LMWH, fondaparinux, or other thrombotic agents excreted by the kidneys, especially in elderly, diabetic, or at high risk of bleeding individuals. In such circumstances, the use of antithrombotic drugs with renal metabolism should be avoided.

Measures to Reduce Surgical Risk from a Cardiovascular Perspective > D) Anticoagulation Management in the Perioperative Period\nThe major challenges of anticoagulation management in the perioperative period are the interruption of anticoagulation, which temporarily increases the risk of thromboembolism and its maintenance during invasive procedures, which may increase the risk of hemorrhagic complications. Both challenges increase the risk of death. When assessing perioperative thromboembolic risk, recognizing the different risk situations for thromboembolism is necessary. One of them is the patient receiving anticoagulation for the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Another risk situation is the patient receiving anticoagulation in the presence of mechanical cardiac prostheses and/or AF for the prevention of arterial thromboembolism. In addition to assessment of thromboembolic risk, we should consider the risk of bleeding that certain surgical procedures present during the use of antithrombotic medications. The risk of bleeding associated with each type of surgical procedure is shown in In general, we divided the procedures in those with high risk of severe bleeding in 2 to 4 days (2 to 4%) and those with low risk (0 to 2%). Severe bleeding is generally defined as a bleeding that results in death or is intracranial or requires reoperation to be stagnant or causes a decrease in hemoglobin \u2265 2 g/dL or requires transfusion of \u2265 2 units of red blood cells.

Measures to Reduce Surgical Risk from a Cardiovascular Perspective > E) Prophylaxis of Infective Endocarditis > I. Dental Procedures\nEarly studies correlated dental extraction with the presence of transient bacteremia. Others indicated that endodontic and periodontal manipulation may lead to similar levels of bacteremia. Based on this, experimental animal models confirmed the reduction of bacteremia after dental manipulation with the use of prophylactic antibiotic therapy. Since then, this recommendation has been established for individuals with an anatomical predisposition to endocarditis. More recently, the impact of prophylaxis on the prevention of endocarditis has been questioned. Clinical trials showed a low prevalence of infectious endocarditis (IE) presumably related to dental treatments, ranging from 2.7 to 13%. Moreover, it has been shown that daily activities, such as mastication, tooth brushing, and flossing are related to transient bacteremia. Other arguments against the use of prophylaxis are risk of anaphylaxis associated with the use of penicillin, efficacy proven only in experimental studies, and possibility of induction of bacterial resistance. Based on these arguments, the recommendation not to use prophylaxis for endocarditis has been instituted in the United Kingdom by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) since 2008. In France, prophylaxis has been recommended for high-risk individuals only since 2002. The same recommendation has been made by the American Heart Association (AHA) since 2007 and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) since 2009. The population considered to be at high risk is composed of individuals with a greater chance of developing complications and die due to illness (severe IE risk conditions). The individuals described in Recent observational studies have shown no increase in the number of endocarditis following recommendations for prophylaxis in high-risk individuals in France and the United States. However, an observational study in the United Kingdom showed an increase in the incidence of infective endocarditis since the NICE recommendations in 2008. In this country, a study performed in 2012 revealed that most cardiologists and cardiac surgeons believed that prophylaxis should be performed in cases of valve prosthesis and previous endocarditis. In the USA, following the new AHA recommendations in 2007, one study showed an increase in the incidence of hospitalizations for streptococcal endocarditis. On the other hand, the limitations imposed on observational cohorts should be considered. Considering that most patients with valvular heart disease in Brazil present characteristics different from those currently observed in the USA and European countries (young people with rheumatic sequelae and higher lethality due to endocarditis) and the lack of prophylaxis studies in Brazil, prophylaxis is recommended for patients with native valve injury, although they do not have a valve prosthesis. Another difference of our population compared to the American and European populations is the higher prevalence of individuals with low access to health care and therefore with lower dental hygiene and higher risk of bacteremia after invasive dental procedures. Although cited in the international literature, a significant adverse effect of antimicrobial therapy is a rare event. Therefore, use of prophylaxis for endocarditis is recommended prior to dental procedures involving the manipulation of gingival tissue, periodontal region, or oral mucosa perforation ( It should be noted that infective endocarditis is a more frequent result of bacteremia from daily activities than after dental procedures. There is no doubt that maintaining good oral health is the best strategy to prevent endocarditis. In individuals with periodontal and endodontic diseases, the incidence and magnitude of bacteremia in daily care and during procedures are higher compared to individuals with healthy teeth. Thus, we recommend emphasizing daily dental care and biannual dental evaluation.", "type": "Document"}

ST-segment monitoring, serial 12-lead ECG, and measurement of cardiac troponin levels are methods used to monitor complications. Studies evaluating the use of continuous ST-segment monitoring have shown that this method has a large sensitivity (between 55 and 100%) and specificity (between 37 and 85%) range for the detection of perioperative ischemia (intra- and postoperatively) because its effectiveness depends on the technique used and the baseline features of the population. The occurrence of postoperative ischemia detected with continuous monitoring in patients submitted to vascular surgeries has prognostic implication and is an independent predictor of long-term cardiovascular events. However, since measurement of perioperative troponin levels (a simpler test) became available, the use of automatic monitoring for diagnosis and prognosis of perioperative myocardial ischemia has been discontinued. It has not been studied further and is therefore not recommended. In the absence of electrocardiographic changes or clinical condition suggestive of ischemia or echocardiographic changes compatible with MI, increases in conventional troponin levels following noncardiac surgeries is associated with a higher rate of cardiovascular events in the short and long term, as shown in several studies. In a meta-analysis of patients submitted to vascular surgeries in 2011, the authors demonstrated that increases in TnI levels postoperatively without MI features was a mortality predictor in a period of 30 days, with a mortality rate of 11.6%. Patients with normal troponin levels and patients with MI had mortality rates of 2.3% and 21.6%, respectively. In 2012, in the VISION study involving 15,133 patients, the authors demonstrated a significant association between the peak of fourth-generation troponin T (TnT) and mortality rate in a period of 30 days. Although there is no sufficient evidence regarding the best strategy to manage cases of increase in troponin levels, we recommend performing a non-invasive or invasive complementary investigation with cardiac risk stratification based on the specific evaluation of the cardiologist before hospital discharge. The use of hs-Tn kits significantly improved the accuracy to rapidly confirm or exclude diagnosis of MI in patients with chest pain in the emergency room. However, its interpretation is still a challenge in the perioperative period. Since 2011, observational studies have evaluated the behavior of hs-TnT in the postoperative period. The studies found an increase of hs-TnT levels above the 99th percentile (14 ng/L) in 45-60% of patients after noncardiac surgeries. In some studies, this increase is related to mortality in the long term. Recently, a study correlated the increase of hs-TnT with noncardiac complications in a period of 30 days after abdominal surgeries. Only one study with 135 patients investigated the hs-TnI in the perioperative period. The authors observed a correlation between increases in hs-TnI levels and mortality. To date, the relevance of isolated increases in hs-Tn levels in the postoperative period remains uncertain. Several conditions may be related to a baseline (chronic) increase in hs-Tn, such as advanced age, HF, CAD, valve diseases, chronic renal failure, or other chronic noncardiac diseases. Therefore, hs-Tn should be dosed preoperatively to determine its baseline value (see item 3.E.I). Even so, no reference value has been established for the value of the variation (delta) that correlates with cardiovascular events or mortality. Whether an increase in perioperative hs-TnT is related only to general mortality or cardiovascular events is difficult to differentiate. Thus, it is harder in clinical practice to determine whether performing additional cardiovascular risk stratification measures will improve the prognosis of the patients. On the other hand, whenever the patient shows increased troponin levels alone, alternative diagnoses that may lead to increases in troponin and are frequent in the perioperative period, such as pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE), acute pericarditis, decompensated HF, arrhythmias, myocarditis, sepsis, shock, or renal failure, should be avoided. We recommend the use of the flowchart shown in Most cardiovascular events occur until the third postoperative day. The use of serial 12-lead ECG during this period is a simple and effective method for detecting events. In a study involving 3,564 patients more than 50 years old, detection of ischemia using postoperative ECG is an independent predictor of cardiovascular events. However, a negative ECG for ischemia does not reduce the risk of events. In another study comparing serial ECG with 3-lead Holter in 55 patients submitted to vascular surgeries, the ECG is as effective as the Holter for detecting myocardial ischemia. Troponin dosage associated with serial ECG until the third postoperative period is the best strategy for the diagnosis of MI. Notably, these ECG studies were performed before the availability of highly sensitive troponins.", "type": "Document"}

Diagnosis and Treatment of Cardiovascular Complications in the Perioperative Period > A) Acute Coronary Syndromes in the Perioperative\nMI is the most feared cardiac complication in the perioperative period, occurring in 0.3-3% of low-risk patients with no history of CAD and reaching 33% in high-risk patients with a history of CAD. MI shows high mortality rates (40-50%), probably related to the existence of comorbidities, diagnostic difficulty, and limitations to use of antithrombotic and antiplatelet drugs. About 50% of perioperative MI is due to instability of atherosclerosis plaques, and the remainder is due to imbalances between supply and consumption of oxygen, which should be considered not only in acute treatment but also in the establishment of prevention strategies. Although clinical consequences of perioperative MI are extremely serious, diagnosis is often not obvious and requires a high degree of clinical suspicion. Most perioperative ischemic events occur within the first three days after the surgical procedure. The classic clinical feature of precordial pain is absent in more than half of the patients, which is partially explained by the residual effect of analgesics or sedatives used in that period. In addition, when chest pain is present, it is often attributed to other more obvious etiologies, such as incisional pain or position of the patient. Other manifestations, such as dyspnea and nausea, have alternative explanations in this period (atelectasis, medication effect). Thus, perioperative MI is frequently undervalued by the medical team. Since it is difficult to interpret the clinical findings, analysis of complementary tests is fundamental for the diagnosis of perioperative myocardial ischemia. Among these, the ECG, the markers of myocardial necrosis, and the transthoracic echocardiogram should be considered. Regarding the analysis of ECG, ischemic alterations should be distinguished from other causes of ECG alterations, such as electrolytic imbalances, hypothermia, drug effects, and incorrect positioning of the leads. Evolutionary pattern should also be considered in the analysis of ECG. It is important to compare the changes in the traces before and after the event. Among the markers of myocardial necrosis, troponin is undoubtedly the most used due to its high sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of myocardial injury. However, this marker is increased in other situations of myocardial injury, in addition to the one caused by obstructive coronary disease. Other complications commonly present in the postoperative period of noncardiac surgeries are pulmonary embolism, HF, arrhythmias, and sepsis, which also increase the levels of markers of myocardial necrosis and should be considered in the differential diagnosis. In addition, patients with renal failure commonly present increases in troponin levels, particularly TnT, but show a steady evolutionary behavior without the typical increase and decrease pattern of MI. On the other hand, CKMB dosage is less useful for the diagnosis of perioperative MI because of its lower sensitivity and specificity compared to troponin. This marker may increase after skeletal muscle injury during surgery, and its relationship with CPK has low reliability in the identification of perioperative myocardial injury. Transthoracic echocardiography is an important tool for the diagnosis. Although a normal test does not exclude the diagnosis, presence of a new alteration in segmental contractility in patients with suspected myocardial ischemia corroborates the diagnosis. It can also provide indirect data for alternative diagnoses, such as pulmonary embolism and non-ischemic HF. It is important to note that analysis of isolated data cannot confirm or exclude the diagnosis of perioperative myocardial ischemia. Although recent publications define very clearly the criteria for the diagnosis of myocardial infarction, perioperative MI remains without well-defined criteria. The diagnostic strategy proposed by this guideline for the identification of patients with perioperative MI is presented in In 2014, the authors of this study proposed prognostic criteria for patients with isolated troponin increases postoperatively based on data from the VISION study. Patients were diagnosed if they presented increases in fourth-generation TnT above the 99th percentile (30 ng/L) without another alternative diagnosis that could explain this result. Although the authors did not use the universal definition of MI, they created the first prognostic score for these patients. They found that age above 75 years (1 point), presence of anterior wall ischemia on ECG (1 point), and alterations in ST-segment (2 points) are independent predictors of mortality in a period of 30 days ( Despite the frequency and prognostic importance, data in the literature are limited with regard to the treatment of perioperative myocardial ischemia. Most of the interventions represent extrapolations of well-established data for acute coronary syndromes not related to surgical procedures. However, all therapeutic strategies require measures that lead to an increased risk of postoperative bleeding. Thus, individualized measures and constant interaction with the surgical team are required. The treatment of MI with no alterations in ST-segment (most cases of perioperative MI) initially requires correction of triggering factors and may perpetuate the ischemic process. Correction of anemia, hypovolemia, and pressure oscillations is the primary measure to be considered in this situation. To achieve consistency with the pathophysiology of the event, stabilization of the coronary plaque should be considered an important measure in the treatment. The extrapolated recommendations for the treatment of spontaneous acute coronary syndrome, antiplatelet treatment with ASA and clopidogrel, and anticoagulation with UFH or LMWH are used. However, one should always weigh the risk of bleeding and the benefit of anticoagulation. Despite the absence of randomized studies in the perioperative period, it is prudent to give preference to UFH in cases of increased risk of bleeding because its effect can be quickly reversed in cases of bleeding. Patients of higher ischemic risk, i.e., those more than 75 years or with anterior wall ischemia on the ECG or clinical or hemodynamic instability, should be referred for early invasive strategy and revascularization. The remaining patients should be submitted to stratification before discharge. Such practice is fundamental to control the alarming morbidity and mortality in the short and long term. MI with ST-segment alterations occurs in a minority of cases and presupposes total occlusion of the coronary artery, requiring immediate intervention. In contrast to MI not related to surgical interventions, thrombolytic therapy is strongly contraindicated in the perioperative period because of prohibitive risk of bleeding. Thus, coronary angiography with primary PCI is the treatment of choice for these patients. This strategy is safe and feasible in those patients considered to be without contraindications to heparin and antiplatelet therapy, which are required during and after the procedure, respectively.", "type": "Document"}

Diagnosis and Treatment of Cardiovascular Complications in the Perioperative Period > B) Acute Atrial Fribrilation/Flutter\nIn the perioperative period, patients may present a variable risk of developing AF. The definition is based on the risk factors of the patient (male gender, advanced age, presence of cardiovascular comorbidities) and type of surgery (thoracic, mainly esophageal and lung surgeries). The reasons for higher occurrence of AF in thoracic surgeries are elevated levels of catecholamines, hypervolemia, right ventricular overload, pericarditis, and marked systemic inflammatory response. The incidence of AF in the perioperative period of noncardiac surgeries (POAF) varies with the characteristics of the patients and the type of surgery. The incidence can vary from 3% in adults > 45 years up to 30% in thoracic surgeries. It usually presents between the second and fourth postoperative days. High ventricular response AF is the most common presentation and may compromise hemodynamics, which may result in hypotension, HF, and myocardial infarction. The triggering factors of atrial arrhythmia are increased sympathetic activity caused by surgical stress, pain, and anemia, in addition to hypotension and hypo or hypervolemia. Hypoxia also causes AF due to vasoconstriction of the pulmonary veins and increases in right atrial pressure and atrial myocardial ischemia. Atrial flutter (FLU) may have the same mechanism of AF but may also occur only due to autonomic imbalance, similar to other paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias. Due to association with cardioembolic events and hemodynamic impairment as in AF, FLU can be diagnosed and managed in a similar manner. Diagnosis is performed using 12-lead ECG or detection on a cardiac monitor for more than 30 seconds. The initial measure for AF/FLU is to identify the triggering factors and to correct them early. Most POAFs have spontaneous reversal in 24 hours. If arrhythmia persists, the initial aim is to control the heart rate, which may remain between 80 and 110 bpm or up to 120 and 130 bpm according to clinical decision (hemodynamic stability and transient situations of increased adrenergic stress). The most commonly used medications for heart rate control are metoprolol, diltiazem, and digoxin (or deslanosid C, if only the venous route is available). Digital use requires slow titration, adequate electrolytic control (calcium, potassium, and magnesium), and monitoring renal function or, in specific cases, digoxinemia. Its efficacy may be compromised by the degree of sympathetic activity in the perioperative period. Diltiazem should not be used in patients with hypotension or with ventricular dysfunction because of its negative inotropic effect. In these patients, the use of \u03b2-blockers is preferred. Some studies indicated the use of venous magnesium or chloride sulfate, which can reverse arrhythmia because of its effect on T- and L-type calcium channels by reducing atrial automatism and heart rate control (inhibition of AV conduction), with a lower hypotensive or inotropic negative effect. During the surgical period, patients present hypercoagulability associated with the risk of bleeding. Thus, most consensuses recommend anticoagulation for the prevention of arterial embolism only after 48 hours of persistent arrhythmia. Clinical scores used to determine the risk of ischemic event and bleeding were not evaluated in the perioperative period. However, the American directive of 2014 recommends the routine use of CHA2DS2-VASC scores for embolic risk and HAS-BLED for bleeding risk. Considering surgical recovery, anemia, hemodynamic stability, and surgical wound, special attention should be given to the risk of bleeding.", "type": "Document"}

Diagnosis and Treatment of Cardiovascular Complications in the Perioperative Period > C) Acute Heart Failure\nThe influence of chronic HF on perioperative risk is well known, with an increase in death of 63% and a readmission rate of 51% in a period of 30 days, compared to patients with CAD but without HF. However, publications on acute perioperative HF in noncardiac surgeries are limited. On the other hand, when HF has recently been diagnosed and it is possible to extrapolate that patients are at least moderately symptomatic or with signs of congestion, there is a clear recommendation for an elective surgery to be postponed until symptoms subside and the reverse remodeling process begins (improvement of ventricular dysfunction and reduction of diastolic volume), following administration and optimization of drugs, such as ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) aldosterone antagonists, and \u03b2-blockers. We can analyze the presence of acute HF through evaluation of natriuretic peptides. Levels of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) or amino terminal portion of ProBNP (NT-proBNP) in the circulation increase when there is ventricular dysfunction. They are particularly increased if ventricular wall tension or fiber stretching exists and are therefore significantly increased in acute HF. Mildly or moderately increased levels have already shown an important relation with morbidity and mortality. In a study of 297 patients more than 50 years old submitted to emergency procedures, Farzi et al. observed a sevenfold increase in the risk of cardiovascular events (nonfatal MI, acute HF, or cardiovascular death) during hospitalization in patients with NT-proBNP above 1,740 mg/mL and patients with NT-proBNP > 1,600 pg/mL showed a fourfold increase in the rate of combined events. The importance of this study relies on the fact that high NT-proBNP levels are compatible with the expected values in patients with acute HF (usually > 1,800 pg/mL defines the patient with acute dyspnea of cardiac cause). Another study evaluated patients with hip fracture submitted to emergency surgery and analyzed the relationship between NT-proBNP and the risk of death. High (> 2,370 pg/mL) and intermediate (806-2,370 pg/mL) NT-proBNP levels are associated with a significantly higher mortality compared to patients with low levels (< 806 pg/mL) - (15 vs. 11 vs. 2%, p = 0.04). In the long term, mortality is also higher in these two groups (69% vs. 49% vs. 27%, p < 0.001). Patients with such increased levels of natriuretic peptides in the preoperative period are probably no longer adequately compensated for HF at the time of surgery and this may be one of the causes of postoperative acute HF. A multicenter study compared 5,094 patients with worsening HF to 5,094 patients without HF, paired by baseline characteristics, submitted to noncardiac surgery. Worsening HF in the perioperative period was associated with a twofold increase in mortality in a period of 30 days (p < 0.001), 1.5-fold increase in postoperative morbidity (p < 0.001), increased risk of developing renal failure, need for mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours, pneumonia, cardiac arrest, unplanned intubation, sepsis, and urinary tract infection (all p < 0.05). BNP or NT-proBNP was not evaluated in this series, and the incidence of myocardial infarction was similar in both groups (p = 0.7). Therefore, patients who are not compensated for HF should not be submitted to elective surgeries because they have a very high risk of developing HF. Studies evaluating the real incidence, cause, diagnosis, and treatment of acute postoperative HF are required. Diagnosis of acute postoperative HF is clinical, and the dosage of natriuretic peptides can be performed in cases of diagnostic uncertainty. The echocardiogram should be performed to evaluate the presence of basic structural heart disease. Treatment should be performed in the same manner as that of acute HF outside the perioperative period. The possible causes of acute postoperative HF are acute CAD, persistently positive perioperative water balance volume overload, involuntary suspension of drugs used to treat chronic HF, renal failure, infection, PTE, and arrhythmias, among others. Among these causes, MI is more common in the first 72 hours of the postoperative period. It may manifest as acute HF or acute pulmonary edema and not as chest pain. MI should always be actively investigated with ECG and serial troponin collection. The echocardiogram may also help in the diagnosis by showing new changes in segmental contractility.", "type": "Document"}

Deep Venous Thrombosis\nDVT of the lower limbs is subdivided into two categories, namely, distal venous thrombosis (calf veins) and proximal vein (popliteal, femoral, or iliac veins). Proximal venous thrombosis is the most commonly associated with PTE. The diagnosis is performed with history and clinical examination (edema, pain, and erythema involving the site) and confirmed by imaging tests. The proposed flowchart for the diagnosis of DVT is shown in Venous Doppler is the test of choice, with a positive predictive value of 94% and has the advantage of being conducted at the bedside.462,463 However, venous Doppler has limitations in detecting isolated thrombi in the iliac veins and in the portion of the femoral vein in the adductor canal. D-dimer dosage should not be used alone for the diagnosis of VTE. D-Dimer is a product of fibrin degradation and is increased (> 500 ng/mL equivalent units of fibrinogen) in virtually all VTE patients. However, this test has high sensitivity and low specificity and may be increased in the elderly, patients with neoplasms, renal failure, pregnancy, and patients recently submitted to surgeries. Iodinated contrast venography can be used when the venous Doppler cannot be performed or gave an uncertain result. Venography can cause discomfort to the patient, besides the greater difficulty in obtaining an adequate study. It has an accuracy similar to the venous Doppler. Magnetic resonance venography (MRV) has the same accuracy as contrast venography (100% sensitivity and 96% specificity). Its major limitation is the high cost, but it is an option when the patient has allergy to iodinated contrast. Angio-CT of the chest with PTE protocol allows visualization of the pulmonary arteries and subdiaphragmatic deep veins, including the lower limbs, in the same test without the need for additional doses of iodinated contrast. In some studies, Angio-CT venography is comparable to venous Doppler for the diagnosis of femoral-popliteal venous thrombosis.

However, it is neither sensitive nor specific for the diagnosis of PTE. Hypoxemia is present in 74% of cases. BNP and troponin: they may be increased but are not sensitive or specific tests for the diagnosis of PTE. They have prognostic implications, being indicative of the severity of PTE. D-dimer: D-dimer, as well as for DVT, is a sensitive but not very specific test. ECG: ECG alterations in patients with PTE are common, although not specific. Tachycardia and ST-segment and T-wave alterations are the most frequent findings (70% of cases of PTE). Classical alterations considered as suggestive of PTE (S1 Q3 T3, right ventricular overload, and incomplete right branch block) are not frequent (< 10%). Electrocardiographic changes that are associated with a worse prognosis are atrial arrhythmias (e.g., AF), bradycardia (< 50 bpm) or tachycardia (> 100 bpm), new right branch block, Q waves in lower leads (DII, DIII, and aVF), ST-segment changes in anterior wall, and T-wave and standard S1 Q3 T3 inversion.

Peripheral wedge-shaped opacity in peripheral lung regions and abrupt cut-off of pulmonary arterioles with distal hypoperfusion are rare but are highly suspected of PTE. Chest X-ray may be normal in 12-22% of patients with PTE. Angio-CT with protocol for PTE: for most patients with PTE, it is the selected diagnostic test due to its high sensitivity (> 90%) and specificity (> 95%) for PTE, especially when associated with D-dimer dosage,471 in patients with moderate to high probability. Demonstration of filling failure in any branch of the pulmonary artery using contrast is a diagnosis of PTE. Ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scintigraphy: this test is reserved for patients with suspected PTE when Angio-CT is contraindicated (renal insufficiency, creatinine clearance < 60 mL/min/m2, contrast allergy, or morbid obesity) or when Angio-CT is inconclusive or negative, but in disagreement with the high clinical suspicion. V/Q scintigraphy is a sensitive test for the diagnosis of PTE, but it is not specific due to its high incidence of false-positive results. Accuracy is higher when chest X-ray is normal. V/Q scintigraphy is selected for the diagnosis of PTE during pregnancy. A high probability V/Q scintigraphy is sufficient for the diagnosis of PTE, whereas a normal scintigraphy is sufficient to exclude PTE. Low or intermediate probabilities are not sufficient for diagnosis. Pulmonary digital angiography with iodinated contrast: this test was the historical gold standard for the diagnosis of PTE. With the development of Angio-CT, it is reserved for patients with suspected PTE when Angio-CT or V/Q scintigraphy is not conclusive. In a retrospective analysis of 20 cases of the PIOPED II study,472 digital angiography was shown to be less sensitive than Angio-CT for the diagnosis of small emboli. It has morbidity of 5% and mortality of < 2%. Exposure to radiation is greater than in Angio-CT. Demonstration of filling failure and abrupt cut-off of pulmonary arterial vessel are diagnoses of embolization. Pulmonary angiography by nuclear magnetic resonance: this test is not very sensitive (77-84%). It is reserved for cases in which other methods cannot be performed.

Thus, we will present the usual recommended treatment, regardless of the perioperative context, but it is important to customize the decisions in conjunction with the surgeon. The main pillar of venous thromboembolism treatment (deep vein thrombosis and PTE) is anticoagulant therapy, which should be a long-term therapy, with a duration of at least 3 months.

Selection of Anticoagulant\nSeveral recent studies have examined the efficacy of new anticoagulants in acute and long-term treatment of VTE and compared to warfarin. These studies showed that the reduction in the risk of recurrence of VTE is similar with both therapies, including cancer patients. The reduction in the risk of recurrence of VTE with the different new anticoagulants (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban) is not directly compared among them, but it appeared to be equally effective based on indirect comparisons. In fact, in the recommendations, the order of the new anticoagulants cited in the text refers to the chronology of the publication of the phase III studies on VTE and is not the order of preference. The new anticoagulants have lower bleeding rates and provide greater convenience for patients and health professionals in relation to fixed dose. They have less drug and food interactions and do not require serial blood tests to ensure a specific therapeutic range. Given these advantages, the new anticoagulants are now preferred compared to warfarin for initial and long-term treatments of VTE in patients without cancer. In cancer patients, a recent randomized study compared the use of LMWH (tinzaparin) and warfarin for the treatment of 900 cancer patients with DVT during the first 6 months. The study demonstrated that LMWH is more effective than warfarin, without alterations in death rates and major bleeding. Other studies have also shown that the reduction of the risk of recurrence of VTE in cancer patients is higher with the use of LMWH compared to warfarin. Therefore, warfarin is preferentially used in patients with VTE without cancer and LMWH in patients with VTE and cancer. No study has directly compared the new anticoagulants and LMWH in cancer patients. However, based on indirect comparisons, LMWH appears to be more effective than the new anticoagulants in patients with VTE and cancer. It is important to emphasize that parenteral anticoagulation was given before the use of dabigatran and edoxaban in previous studies. It was not used prior to rivaroxaban and apixaban.

Changes are often small and may correspond to false positives, and true subsegmental PTE is generally associated with small DVTs. The risk of progression or recurrence of VTE in the absence of anticoagulation is small in relation to larger PTEs. Imaging of DVT should be performed on the lower limbs, as well as on the upper limbs and central venous catheters.

In these cases, it is important to evaluate the risk factors for recurrence or progression of VTE, which include the following: patients hospitalized or with reduced mobility for other reasons; patients with active cancer, especially those with metastatic disease or those treated with chemotherapy; or patients with non-reversible risk factors, such as recent surgery.

Hypothyroidism\nIn epidemiological studies, the overall incidence of hypothyroidism varies from 0.1 to 2%. The prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism is higher, ranging from 4 to 10% in the adult population and tending to be higher in women more than 65 years. Most of the population, even asymptomatic, has thyroid alterations. Some clinical conditions present a potential risk for the development of perioperative complications and a rapid decline in thyroid function, such as age > 65 years; hypothalamic or pituitary disease; coexisting autoimmune disease; irradiation of the neck, thyroid surgery, or radioiodine therapy; significant hyperlipidemia; hyponatremia; high levels of muscle enzyme; macrocytic anemia; and pleural or pericardial effusion. If these risk conditions are present, screening for thyroid disease may be useful in the preoperative period. The recommended test is TSH because 95% of the causes of hypothyroidism are of primary thyroid etiology. No randomized study has demonstrated the benefit of patients with hypothyroidism being euthyroid in the preoperative period compared to hypothyroid and postoperative morbidity and mortality. Current evidence shows that if there is a prior diagnosis and time, the patient should be euthyroid in the preoperative period. However, if the patient has subclinical or mild hypothyroidism and the operation is urgent, the surgical procedure should not be postponed. In elective surgeries, treatment can begin, but we should not wait until TSH normalized. Patients with clinical or moderate hypothyroidism and scheduled for urgent surgery should undergo the surgical procedure and initiate treatment in the immediate postoperative period. Patients with moderate hypothyroidism and elective surgeries should wait for euthyroidism to undergo the surgery. These patients do not necessarily need to achieve normalized TSH levels because 10 to 20% have a slow TSH decay. The most important criterion is that progressive increase and normalization of free T4 levels occur, which should exist within seven days, or treatment should continue to further increase the levels. Patients with severe hypothyroidism or myxedema coma should only be operated if the surgery is an emergency. If the surgery is elective, previous treatment of hypothyroidism and acquisition of normal thyroid function should be considered. Treatment should be given in the form of T4 and T3. The doses used are as follows: T4 with an attack dose of 200-300 mcg intravenously, followed by 50 mcg per day; T3 dose of 5-20 mcg intravenously, followed by 2.5-10 mcg every 8 hours, depending on age and cardiovascular comorbidities.

According to the Risk and Protection Factors for Chronic Diseases by Telephone Survey (VIGITEL), 52.2% Brazilians are overweight. Approximately 30% of surgical patients are obese. Obesity is related to several morbidities that influence perioperative evaluation and management, such as atherosclerotic disease, HF, systemic arterial hypertension, PH, DVT, and low functional capacity. Excess weight is also associated with problems in the respiratory system, such as reduced functional residual capacity, atelectasis, and pulmonary shunts. The association results in a risk of rapid desaturation due to the combination of high basal metabolic rate and oxygen demand. Furthermore, sleep disorders, such as obstructive apnea and alveolar hypoventilation, are special concerns in the perioperative period of the obese. Weight is not only related to the greater risk of complications but also to the distribution of fat mass. Centripetal fat distribution (trunk and abdomen) is associated with metabolic syndrome, sleep disturbances, and unfavorable anatomy for intubation. Classifying the degree and type of obesity and screening for sleep-disordered breathing are essential steps to identify specific functional limitations and guide perioperative decisions. The World Health Organization classifies obesity in grades: obesity grade 1: BMI 30-34.9 kg/m2; obesity grade 2: BMI 35-39.9 kg/m2; obesity grade 3: BMI \u2265 40 kg/m2.

Anemias\nAs doen\u00e7as hematol\u00f3gicas podem aumentar a morbidade e aHematologic diseases may increase the morbidity and mortality of individuals submitted to surgical procedures. Anemia is the most common hematological problem found in the preoperative period. It is generally defined according to WHO criteria: hemoglobin concentration < 13 g/dL for men and < 12 g/dL for women. It is often a sign of underlying disease that can affect the surgical outcome. Studies involving many patients indicated that preoperative anemia is an independent risk factor for morbidity, mortality, and transfusion requirement, with an association between extent of anemia and outcome. Anemia leads to overload of the cardiovascular system, increasing cardiac output. Individuals with CD have less tolerance to anemia, and its presence can intensify the conditions of myocardial ischemia and underlying HF. Therefore, identification of anemia in the preoperative period assists in the identification of patients at risk of adverse outcome in the postoperative period. Whenever possible, anemia should be identified, investigated, and corrected before surgery, although there is no randomized evidence that its correction alters the perioperative risk. On the other hand, there is randomized evidence that the correction of anemia in the preoperative period decreases the need for blood transfusion and consequently the postoperative transfusion risk. The available guidelines for perioperative blood transfusion are limited, but the risks and benefits of this measure should always be questioned. Traditional practices, such as correction of preoperative anemia for normal or near-normal values of hemoglobin concentration (Hb \u2265 12 g/dL) to prepare patients for surgery, are not supported in the literature and are not recommended in clinical practice. Numerous studies and reviews have attempted to establish transfusion triggers for patients with anemia by evaluating two strategies: \u201crestrictive\u201d (usually Hb < 7.0 g/dL) and \u201cliberal\u201d (usually Hb \u2265 7.0 g/dL). Most meta-analyses included perioperative patients of various natures: critical and clinical patients, as well as adults and children. The meta-analysis of Carson et al. included 6,264 patients. These surgical and clinical patients involved adults and children. The authors concluded that the existing evidence supported the use of restrictive transfusion therapy in most patients, but that the effects of the restrictive strategy in high-risk groups, such as acute coronary syndrome, needed to be tested in future large studies. In the meta-analysis of Holst et al., 9,813 patients from 31 randomized controlled trials were included. These trials consisted of twenty perioperative and acute blood loss studies, eight critical patient studies, two trauma studies, and one study with patients with leukemia undergoing bone marrow transplantation. According to the authors, the results were not affected by the inclusion of studies with high risk or unclear risk. The restrictive strategy was associated with the reduction in the number of transfused red cell concentrate units and the number of transfused patients; however, mortality, overall morbidity, and myocardial infarction remained unchanged. The restrictive strategy is safe in most clinical settings, and liberal transfusion does not show any benefit to the patients analyzed in this review. In the meta-analysis of Docherty et al., they specifically investigated the effect of restrictive versus liberal strategy in patients with CD undergoing noncardiac surgery. A total of 3,033 patients were included: 1,514 with restrictive transfusion and 1,519 with liberal transfusion. The risk of acute coronary syndrome was higher in patients with a restrictive strategy compared to patients with a liberal strategy, but the effects on mortality and other outcomes were uncertain in a period of 30 days. The authors concluded that it may not be safe to use a transfusion trigger below 8 g/dL in these patients. Perioperative mortality in a period of 90 days was investigated in a recent review with meta-analysis, which included only perioperative adult patients and critically ill patients. Twenty-seven studies with 11,021 patients were included in the review: 17 in the perioperative period (9 in orthopedic surgery, 5 in cardiac, 1 in vascular, 1 in oncologic, and 1 in obstetric) and 10 in critically ill patients. Overall, there was no difference in mortality between the liberal and restrictive strategies. However, in the perioperative period, mortality was reduced in adult patients randomized to receive the liberal strategy compared to those who received the restrictive strategy with 7,552 patients. In critical patients, there was no difference between the groups. The heterogeneity between the studies was low. It was concluded that blood transfusion had a different statistically significant effect on the survival of patients in different clinical contexts. In an isolated study, Carson et al. included 2,016 patients aged \u2265 50 years. The patients had a history or risk factors for CD, with a hemoglobin concentration below 10 g/dL after hip surgery. They were randomized to liberal (transfusion trigger above 10 g/dL) or restrictive (symptoms of anemia or Hb < 8 g/dL) strategy to determine whether a higher transfusion trigger would improve the recovery of patients submitted to orthopedic hip fracture surgery. The authors concluded that the liberal and restrictive strategies did not reduce death rates, did not improve recovery in a period of 60 days of follow-up, and did not reduce hospital morbidity in older patients at high cardiovascular risk. Another isolated study was conducted at John Hopkins Hospital including 10,163 patients submitted to vascular or gastrointestinal cardiothoracic surgery. The authors aimed to determine the transfusion practices and the effect of the use of transfusion on the perioperative outcome. They concluded that the use of the liberal transfusion trigger (Hb \u2265 7.0 g/dL) after major surgeries was more common than the restrictive practice (trigger < 7.0 g/dL) and that patients with restrictive transfusion had no increased risk of complications compared to patients with liberal transfusion. Therefore, the optimal transfusion trigger remains undetermined. Hemoglobin level is probably not the answer because some patients require higher values and others tolerate values lower than 7 g/dL. The transfusion triggers used in isolated studies and in studies that were part of large reviews with meta-analysis are not homogeneous. Therefore, the decision on blood transfusion should be based not only on hemoglobin levels, but also on the suspicion of organic ischemia, the risk or presence of bleeding, the status of the intravascular volume, and the susceptibility to complications due to inadequate oxygenation. Common sense, careful observation of the patient, and clinical context should guide the decision of the best strategy for each case. It should be noted that blood transfusion is not a risk-free procedure and that a dose-dependent relationship exists between transfusions and complications. Thus, even if selecting the liberal strategy, hemoglobin correction towards normal values is not necessary. One unit of erythrocyte concentrate increases the hemoglobin rate by approximately 1.0 g/dL and the hematocrit by approximately 3.0%. The optimal rate of administration of red blood cell concentrate should consider the clinical situation. Most patients can receive a packed red blood cell unit every one to two hours. Patients at risk of volume overload should receive 1.0 mL/kg/h. After transfusion of each unit, the patient should be reevaluated and the hemoglobin level must be determined.", "type": "Document"}

Hereditary Antiphospholipid Antibodies and Thrombophilias\nAntiphospholipid antibodies are a family of autoantibodies directed against plasma phospholipid-binding proteins. Antiphospholipid syndrome is characterized by thrombosis (arterial and/or venous) and/or gestational morbidity in patients with persistent antiphospholipid antibodies. However, there are patients with a persistent presence of antiphospholipid antibodies without vaso-occlusive manifestations, only gestational morbidity and manifestations are not considered as criteria for the antiphospholipid syndrome (thrombocytopenia, livedo reticularis, cardiac valve disease). In addition, not every positive test for antiphospholipid antibodies is clinically significant and not every patient with positive antiphospholipid antibodies has the same thrombotic risk. To better estimate the thrombotic risk in patients with positive antiphospholipid antibody tests, some variables should be considered including persistently positive laboratory tests and presence of additional thrombotic risk factors. Although several studies have evaluated thrombotic risk in asymptomatic patients with persistent antiphospholipid antibodies, most of them included patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. The annual risk of the first thrombotic event in these laboratory-positive individuals, but without other associated autoimmune diseases and other thrombotic risk factors, is low (less than 1% per year). In the presence of another autoimmune disease, the risk increases to less than 4% per year. Based on the hypothesis of the association of \u201ctwo injuries\u201d, antiphospholipid antibodies induce a prothrombotic and proinflammatory phenotype in endothelial cells that is not capable of causing thrombosis alone. However, the presence of a triggering event or \u201csecond injury\u201d, such as infection, surgeries, estrogen use, and prolonged immobilization, may trigger a vaso-occlusive event. Therefore, pharmacological antithrombotic prophylaxis is associated with mechanical measures in patients with positive antiphospholipid antibodies and in a period of greater vaso-occlusive risk (surgeries, immobilization, hospitalization). Patients with antiphospholipid syndrome under anticoagulant treatment have a higher thrombotic risk when submitted to surgical procedures. The term thrombophilia describes the tendency to develop venous thromboembolism due to a state of hypercoagulability caused by the presence of inherited or acquired abnormalities of coagulation or fibrinolysis. Hereditary thrombophilias do not present the same thrombotic risk. Severe thrombophilias are those resulting from deficiencies of natural anticoagulants (antithrombin, protein C, and protein S), abnormalities in homozygous, and presence of multiple defects. Presence of factor V Leiden in heterozygosity and the mutation G20210A in heterozygosis are considered mild thrombophilias. On the other hand, the presence of family history of venous thromboembolism events is a strong risk factor for venous thromboembolism, regardless of the presence of genetic alterations. Documentation of the presence of an inherited thrombophilic alteration implies the need for primary anticoagulant prophylaxis in situations where an increased risk of venous thromboembolism exists, such as surgical procedures.", "type": "Document"}

Evaluation of Comorbidities > F) Renal Failure\nPatients with renal failure are more prone to postoperative complications, prolonged hospitalization time, higher costs during hospitalization, and higher mortality than those without renal dysfunction. Renal failure or preoperative dialysis has been consistently associated with postoperative complications and high mortality. In preoperative evaluation, renal function can be assessed using the Cockroft-Gault formula, or glomerular filtration can be estimated using the MDRD equation. Estimated glomerular filtration of less than 60 mL/min /1.73 m2 is a risk factor for cardiac and noncardiac complications in the postoperative period and is associated with mortality up to two times higher compared to patients with normal renal function Lee et al. developed and validated a prognostic model for cardiovascular complications after noncardiac surgeries. The risk factors identified were (increasing risk) history of congestive HF, coronary ischemic disease, high risk surgery (abdominal aortic aneurysm, other vascular, thoracic, abdominal, and orthopedic surgeries), insulin-dependent DM, preoperative creatinine > 2.0 mg/dL, and cerebrovascular disease. The development of acute renal injury (ARI) is a serious complication in the postoperative period and occurs, depending on the type of surgery, in 1-30% of the cases, with mortality around 50%. There is evidence that small changes in serum creatinine are associated with increased morbidity and mortality in clinical and surgical patients. In the latest international guidelines, ARI is considered when a patient presents an increase of 0.3 mg/dL in serum creatinine in 48 hours or a 50% increase in baseline value within 7 days associated or not with the reduction of urinary volume to values below 0.5 mL/kg/h over a 6-hour period. In a study with 75,952 noncardiac surgeries, the authors identified the following risk factors for ARI in the postoperative period: age \u2265 56 years, male, emergency surgery, intraperitoneal surgery, DM with oral medication or insulin, decompensated HF, hypertension, \u201cmild\u201d renal failure (preoperative creatinine between 1.2 and 1.9 mg/dL), and \u201cmoderate\u201d renal failure (creatinine \u2265 2.0 mg/dL). Patients with 6 or more risk factors had an ARI incidence of 9% in the postoperative period and mortality eight times higher than the patients who did not present renal dysfunction. The prevention of ARI in the postoperative period depends on the following care: identifying risk factors for its development (mainly preoperative renal failure), avoiding the use of nephrotoxic drugs, maintaining adequate hydration, and avoiding hypotension. Even relatively short periods of intraoperative hypotension (MAP lower than 60 mmHg for more than 20 minutes or 55 mmHg for more than 10 minutes) are associated with an increased risk of ARI. Attempts to prevent ARI with drugs, such as diuretics and vasoactive amines, have not shown efficacy. Potentially nephrotoxic drugs should be avoided or used appropriately with correction for the level of renal function. Aminoglycoside antibiotics, amphotericin B, radiological contrast, and non-hormonal anti-inflammatories are examples of nephrotoxic drugs commonly used in the perioperative period. The use of anti-inflammatories should be avoided, particularly in patients at risk: advanced age, previous renal failure, HF, dehydration, concomitant use of ACE inhibitors, and diuretics or other nephrotoxic agent. ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are potentially nephrotoxic drugs, and prescription should be evaluated in the perioperative period. In a recent work with orthopedic patients, use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs is associated with a higher risk of developing ARI in the postoperative period. In the preoperative evaluation of patients with chronic renal failure on dialysis or renal transplants, some aspects are relevant. Many of these patients have known risk factors for coronary ischemic disease, such as advanced age, systemic arterial hypertension, or DM. Patients on a renal replacement therapy program should undergo dialysis before surgery to prevent hypervolemia, correct electrolyte and acid-base imbalances, and reduce the risk of bleeding due to uremia. In renal transplant patients, immunosuppression should be carefully adjusted by the nephrologist in the perioperative period because of the risk of acute rejection and nephrotoxicity. The risk of postoperative complications is well defined in patients with renal failure. In these cases, the evaluation of the nephrologist should be considered. It should always be noted that creatinine is a poorly sensitive marker of renal function. Therefore, creatinine < 1.2 mg/dL does not necessarily mean normal renal function, particularly in elderly patients or patients with reduced muscle mass. The preoperative evaluation is an opportunity to communicate with the patient and the clinical-surgical team to define measures to prevent deterioration of renal function and for subsequent follow-up aimed at delaying the progression of chronic renal failure.", "type": "Document"}

Evaluation of Comorbidities > G) Pulmonary Hypertension\nPH is a clinical condition that results from increased right ventricular afterload, leading to pressure increase in the pulmonary vascular territory and progressive right ventricular dysfunction. The diagnosis of PH involves right chamber catheterization and measurement of pulmonary artery pressure. Hypertensive condition is defined by a mean pulmonary arterial pressure (PAPm) greater than or equal to 25 mmHg. There are several mechanisms or clinical conditions that can lead to PH from direct involvement of the pulmonary vasculature to left heart disease, pulmonary parenchymal diseases, or even associated with chronic PTE. The pathophysiology of the decompensation of PH depends on the functional characteristics of the right ventricle. Due to the normal mechanical features of the pulmonary circulation (high complacency and low resistance), there is no tolerance for afterloading increases. The increase of the afterload generates distension of the free wall of the RV and consequent decoupling of the muscular fibers (Frank-Starling\u2019s Law), impairing the efficiency of the RV systole. There are several causes of RV failure including natural evolution of PH, regardless of the underlying cause, as well as other decompensations, such as infectious cardiac arrhythmias and surgical stress. The surgical procedure is related to significant morbidity and mortality in patients with PH. Mortality is estimated between 4% and 24% in several cases, depending on the stage of the disease and the surgical procedure that the patient underwent. When only cardiac surgeries are considered, mortality is higher than 25%, because there is a high risk of ischemia and RV dysfunction, particularly at the time of cardiopulmonary bypass. During surgery, several factors may impair RV function due to reduction of coronary perfusion with consequent ischemia and elevation of pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), leading to increased afterload ( Ideally, perioperative evaluation of these patients should be performed by a multidisciplinary team. The need for the surgery in question should be carefully evaluated, considering the risks and benefits and avoiding emergency procedures that may increase morbidity and mortality. Preoperative evaluation is complex because it should include assessment of baseline conditions related to the genesis of PH, as well as the associated hemodynamics. In this manner, evaluation is based on clinical data obtained with chest X-ray, pulmonary function test, ECG, echocardiogram, and measurement of biomarkers, such as BNP. Performing right cardiac catheterization to effectively assess ventricular function through direct measurement of cardiac output, as well as levels of atrial and ventricular filling pressures, may be required, depending on the clinical condition of the patient and the procedure to be performed. This comprehensive evaluation aims to better control PH, with optimization of diuretic therapy, as well as the use of specific medications in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Some specific conditions deserve particular attention. Patients with chronic PTE should maintain anticoagulant therapy throughout the perioperative period. The transition from oral anticoagulants to anticoagulants with a known half-life (e.g., enoxaparin or UFH in an infusion pump) is recommended. As for anticoagulated patients, due to pulmonary arterial hypertension, the perioperative suspension of this medication does not imply an additional risk and can be performed aiming at greater procedural safety. In these patients, the use of specific drugs to control PH, such as endothelin receptor antagonists, phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors, and prostanoids, should be maintained; if necessary, substitution with inhaled or intravenous formulations is possible. Regional anesthesia (blocks or epidural) is apparently better tolerated in patients with PH than general anesthesia. In the intraoperative period, care must be taken to manage the fluids administered (avoiding excess or lack of volume, which may deteriorate cardiac output), as well as analgesic control. Hypotension should be avoided to maintain adequate coronary perfusion of the RV. For this, monitoring with invasive blood pressure and pulmonary artery catheter is useful, as well as vasoactive drugs that maintain SVR without significantly interfering with PVR. Mechanical ventilation during the surgical procedure should be protective with low tidal volume (6 mL/kg with steady pressure < 30 cmH2O), avoiding hypoxia. It must give preference to the management of FiO2 over the increase of PEEP, not to compromise venous return and decrease RV preload, as well as a potential increase in PVR. It is possible to use inhaled nitric oxide considering its short half-life, low repercussion in systemic hemodynamics, and significant auxiliary role in the control of PVR. Considering all the complexity related to the right ventricular dysfunction, patients with PH scheduled for noncardiac operations should have the preoperative evaluation and surgical procedure preferably performed in a specialized center for the treatment of various forms of PH.", "type": "Document"}

Evaluation of Comorbidities > H) Asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease\nPerioperative pulmonary complications largely contribute to perioperative morbidity and mortality. Some series estimate that pulmonary complications may be present in up to 70% of cases in the postoperative period, depending on the type of surgery and clinical profile of the patient. In addition, pulmonary complications are among the ones that increase hospitalization costs and lead to longer hospitalization. The definition of postoperative pulmonary complication greatly varies. The most common are atelectasis, infections (including acute bronchitis and pneumonia), prolonged mechanical ventilation and respiratory failure, exacerbation of chronic lung disease, and bronchospasm. Risk factors related to patients that are associated with a higher incidence of pulmonary complications are diagnosis of COPD, asthma, active smoking, obstructive sleep apnea, PH, and upper airway infection. Regarding the factors associated with the procedure, the surgical site should be emphasized (the closer to the diaphragm, the greater the risk of complications), but also the duration of the procedure (greater risk with surgeries lasting more than 3 to 4 hours), type of anesthesia (general anesthesia with a greater risk than neuroaxial block) and type of neuromuscular blocker (pancuronium associated with a higher incidence of posterior neuromuscular block than agents with a less prolonged effect). There is a significant difference in the evaluation of patients scheduled for pulmonary resection and patients scheduled for other types of surgery. In the first group, pulmonary function tests, arterial blood gas analysis, chest imaging exams, and cardiopulmonary tests are fundamental. Risk predictors, such as ARISCAT, Arozullah, and Gupta, can be used to estimate perioperative pulmonary complications of surgeries without pulmonary resection. The simplest table is ARISCAT that predicts the general incidence of postoperative complications (any severity). In this table, independent risk factors receive a weighted score, producing risk ranges for postoperative complications: 0 to 25 points: low risk, 1.6% complication rate; 26 to 44 points: intermediate risk, 13.3% complication rate; and 45 to 123 points: high risk, 42.1% complication rate ( Regarding management to reduce pulmonary complications, the recommendations are similar to those outside the surgical context aimed at optimizing pulmonary function and minimizing the occurrence of respiratory complications. Optimization of pulmonary function includes the use of antibiotics when active infection is observed, as well as the use of corticosteroids and/or bronchodilators in patients already taking these drugs or who present residual bronchospasm. Smoking cessation should be recommended preferably more than two months before the surgical procedure. Specialized physiotherapy care and follow-up are important in this context. Education of the patient regarding pulmonary expansion exercises is fundamental since the preoperative period. In a systematic review of the literature conducted in 2016, the approach with postoperative pulmonary expansion exercises was the only strategy with a Level of evidence A for the reduction of pulmonary complications. In summary, there is no recommendation for specific reduction of perioperative cardiac complications in patients with COPD/Asthma.", "type": "Document"}

Despite this, discussion about smoking during the preoperative preparation of the patient is mostly absent, which is partly due to the lack of knowledge of the doctors on the ideal timing for cessation of smoking.

Cessation of Smoking in the Preoperative Period\nThe negative effects of smoking on surgical outcomes are multifactorial. However, they are mainly due to the direct effects of nicotine carbon monoxide (CO) and increased oxidative and inflammatory stress. CO and nicotine increase heart rate, blood pressure, and tissue oxygen demand, as well as decrease oxygen transport capacity. Because of the vasoconstricting effect of nicotine, it increases the risk of tissue ischemia in surgery and in other areas, such as the coronary artery. The irritant and proinflammatory effect of numerous components of cigarette smoke on the airways also increase the susceptibility of smoking patients to respiratory infections, local healing complications in lung surgeries, and longer periods under mechanical ventilation. Smoking is also associated with the need for higher doses of anesthetics and neuromuscular blockers, increased incidence of thromboembolic events, and slower repair processes in orthopedic surgeries. Patients scheduled for surgeries are usually more motivated to quit smoking and are thus susceptible to a therapeutic approach to quit smoking. With the regulation of hospitals (and other enclosed spaces for public and private use) as tobacco-free environments, and with the increasing availability of effective therapeutic resources to help the patient to stop smoking, the preoperative period becomes a perfect time to stop smoking before elective surgical hospitalization. The ideal time to stop smoking before surgery had been controversial. This was partly due to the great methodological heterogeneity of studies that evaluated the different periods to stop smoking, the difficulty of controlling confounding variables in the samples of patients, the great variation in the postoperative follow-up time, and the multiplicity of outcomes studied. A review of prospective studies on the impact of smoking cessation in the preoperative period on the occurrence of postoperative complications (respiratory, infectious, general mortality and length of hospital stay) was conducted by Cropley and Theadom. They concluded that although there is great methodological limitation of the studies evaluated, there are several benefits of smoking cessation before surgical hospitalizations. They reported that longer abstinence period results in greater benefit. It should also be mentioned that there is no ideal period to recommend preoperative smoking abstinence, in terms of reduction of surgical complications and risk in the medium and long term. Cessation of smoking should not be postponed due to the unsustainable assumption that risk increases when cessation occurs less than two months before surgery. In 2009, a retrospective cohort study evaluated data from 7,990 lung resection surgeries due to neoplasia. The study concluded that the risks of in-hospital mortality and respiratory complications after lung resection were higher in smokers and clearly reduced by smoking cessation in the preoperative period. The ideal interval between cessation of smoking and surgery could not be identified, which reinforced the recommendation for counseling (and treatment) for smoking cessation, regardless of the proximity of the surgery. This corroborates the results presented in the study published in 2001 by Nakagawa et al. They found a clear and increasing reduction in the risk of postoperative complications after four weeks of preoperative smoking cessation.", "type": "Document"}

Therapeutic Strategies\nAs in general situations, the treatment of nicotine dependence in patients scheduled for surgery and in hospitalized patients is based on cognitive-behavioral interventions (brief approach, individual counseling, provision of informational materials, and group therapy), systematized or not, and in the pharmacological support. Regarding the \u201cintensity\u201d of the non-pharmacological approach, a systematic review published in 2012 evaluated several studies in hospitalized patients. The study showed a dose-response relationship between the intervention and the cessation rate. Moreover, structured counseling programs initiated at the hospital and extended for at least one month after discharge are more effective compared to single-point approaches during hospitalization (RR 1.37; 95% CI 1.27-1.48; 25 studies). Prospective studies evaluating the effectiveness of implementing a structured counseling, cognitive-behavioral approach, pharmacologic support, and post-discharge follow-up of hospitalized smokers showed success rates of about 35-44% in six months and approximately 33% after 12 months, with studies showing success rates above 50% after one year in hospitalized coronary patients. Given the need to specify, in cases of surgical and hospitalized patients, cessation of smoking and the control of nicotine withdrawal symptoms in a shorter period, nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), isolated or combined, is the most frequent approach selected. The usual transdermal nicotine prescription schemes (6 to 8 weeks of 21 mg/24h or 15 mg/16h, 2 weeks of 14 mg/24h or 10 mg/16h and 2 weeks of 7 mg/24h or 5 mg/16h, depending on the presentation selected) are recommended, in association with rapid forms of ad libitum replacement (in Brazil, chewing gum and tablets are available, both in presentations of 2 and 4 mg per unit) for craving episodes. The addition of NRT to an intensive counseling intervention (more than one session, post-discharge) increased smoking cessation rates compared to intensive counseling alone (RR 1.54, 95% CI 1.34-1, 79, six studies). The same systematic review did not show evidence of benefit of adding bupropion (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.75-1.45, three studies) or varenicline (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.95-1.76, two studies) to intensive counseling. Regarding bupropion, new studies, such as the randomized placebo-controlled trial conducted by Eisenberg et al., failed to demonstrate the superiority of bupropion over placebo in hospitalized patients. In the same year, a study published by Smith et al. evaluated the addition of varenicline to counseling through a randomized, placebo-controlled, protocol. The result showed a significant superiority of pharmacological intervention compared to the control group (RR 1.45; 95% CI 1.03-2.03; p = 0.03). Although there is potential benefit of other pharmacological approaches to smoking cessation in hospitalized patients, NRT remains the standard of care at the same doses and schemes normally recommended for other clinical situations. The use of customized doses (above 21 mg/day) of nicotine replacement to reach plasma levels of nicotine closer to the arterial concentrations of an active smoker and aimed at better control of withdrawal symptoms in heavy smokers has been tested and is safe up to doses higher than 42 mg per day, even in individuals who persisted smoking. However, the heterogeneity of the studies and the small number of volunteers included do not provide sufficient evidence of an increase in long-term smoking abstinence rates. The possible association of NRT with non-nicotinic drug (such as bupropion) or the choice of varenicline monotherapy is theoretically an acceptable option, but they do not find great support in specific studies in these special situations. NRT is not superior over bupropion in patients with a history of recent (below six weeks) high-risk acute coronary syndrome and patients with complex ventricular arrhythmias. Published studies are controversial in identifying additional benefits (in addition to the control of withdrawal symptoms) from the drug treatment compared to the counseling program and behavioral approach alone. For hospitalized patients, we propose a treatment based on the flowchart in There is consistent evidence supporting the treatment to stop smoking in subpopulations of hospitalized patients and candidates for surgical procedures. This intervention is extremely effective and inexpensive. In general, the therapeutic strategies are not much different from the routines suggested for general populations, but there is a preference for NRT. Hospital admissions and consultations for the evaluation of surgical risks and perioperative care should consider the active approach to cessation of smoking, researching, advising, treating, and following-up these patients.\n", "type": "Document"}

Sepsis post\u2010trauma operative care includes all the following common and less common sites of sepsis: Chest\u2014pneumonia (community or ventilator/hospital acquired [VAP]) may also be seen as trauma\u2010associated pneumonia, catheter\u2010related (intravenous site, urinary tract [CAUTI], and bloodstream [CLABSI]), wound sepsis (Surgical Site Infection as defined by the centers for disease control), and less common sepsis sources such as sinusitis, tracheitis, abnormal heart valve endocarditis, meningitis or brain abscess, and middle\u2010ear infections [ Associated comorbidity and poorly defined benchmarks, along with many confounding issues make setting benchmarks challenging [ Screening should include comprehensive clinical evaluation of any new onset fever in excess of 38.4\u00b0C with systemic signs of inflammation. Nonseptic causes of fever must be excluded. Blood tests include white cell count (which may lag behind other markers), platelets (an unexpected drop is related to sepsis), the sending of sputum, stool, and wound specimens for culture sent to the relevant laboratory, and the use of sepsis markers, of which procalcitonin (PCT) and beta\u2010d\u2010glucan appear the most clinically relevant, since CRP and D\u2010dimers are almost universally abnormal in the acute post\u2010trauma period. Higher PCT cutoffs have been associated with better diagnostic discrimination [ Once cultures have been sent, there is often the use of empiric antibiotic therapy; however, waiting for microbiological guidance has no worse outcome in those with probable VAP not in septic shock [ Treatment of surgical site infection is primarily source\u2010control but may include antimicrobial or topical therapy determined by whether or not there are only local signs or systemic sepsis (e.g., removal of sutures and cleaning the wound vs. the need for antimicrobials), whereas deeper sepsis will require a combination of repeat surgery and systemic therapy [ 13. Summary and recommendations: Sepsis screening in the postoperative period: There is moderate quality evidence to support routine application of surgical site infection and other sepsis guidelines as for other critically ill patients with the proviso that the inflammation of trauma must be considered as a potential confounding variable for a number of the sepsis markers. Clinical correlation with results of tests is highly supported and selective culture\u2010guided antibiotic use recommended. Level of evidence: moderate Recommendation grade: strong 14. Central line insertion and Urinary catheter care and removal PICO: In trauma patients with invasive lines, what is the role of routine line\u2010change in prevention of sepsis compared to no routine change? In an effort to reduce ICU\u2010acquired device sepsis, namely, CLABSI and CAUTI, the literature supports the use of personnel education, standardized aseptic techniques for insertion, and prompt device removal when no longer needed as effective against the development of infection. There is no data to suggest routine device changes or the use of chlorhexidine or other antimicrobial washes to decrease ICU\u2010related device infections. A recent meta\u2010analysis supported the use of bundles in the insertion and maintenance of central lines, advocating for prompt removal when the device was no longer needed but not addressing routine device changes to minimize infection [ 14. Summary and recommendations: Central line insertion and Urinary catheter care and removal: There is moderate quality evidence to support bundles for the insertion of central lines and urinary catheters and to support their removal on indication rather than routine line changes. Level of evidence: moderate Recommendation grade: strong 15. Anesthesia PICO: In cases requiring an anesthesia for polytrauma and major trauma procedures, what are the optimal balanced anesthesia options for best survival in this patient group? The administration of anesthetic medications is frequently associated with hypotension [ Anesthetic familiarity is a key safety measure when using induction agents. There is insufficient evidence in the anesthetic literature to stipulate specific general anesthetic induction and maintenance techniques. Ketamine is likely to be the most cardiovascular stable anesthetic induction agent available [ The use of muscle relaxants was previously controversial. It is now accepted that the use of muscle relaxants improves intubating conditions and reduces airway complications. Both suxamethonium and rocuronium are acceptable agents. The intubating doses should be increased to ensure rapid onset and dense paralysis [ Two maintenance techniques, which likely confer the greatest cardiovascular stability, are the use of ketamine infusions [ Anesthetic induction and airway management often need to occur outside the operating room to secure a threatened airway, rescue a patient in respiratory failure, or even to allow control of the process of resuscitation. The decision to administer anesthesia and manage the airway outside the operating room is difficult. The benefits of control of the airway must be weighed against multiple risks, including time lost to perform anesthesia and airway management, the risks of cardiovascular compromise, and the risk of inability to secure the airway [ 15. Summary and recommendations: Induction and maintenance of anesthesia and airway management carries a risk of cardiovascular collapse, especially in the hypovolemic patient. Fluid resuscitation should commence prior to induction of anesthesia in all hypotensive patients and those normotensive patients deemed to be significantly hypovolemic. Administration of anesthesia should be delayed until the operating theater or other point of hemorrhage control unless the patient's physiology mandates otherwise. Rational choices for administration of anesthesia are ketamine induction and maintenance, with consideration of low dose volatile maintenance of anesthesia. Level of evidence: moderate Recommendation grade: strong 16. Drains, nasogastric tubes, and urinary catheters PICO: In trauma patients with intra\u2010abdominal injury, what is the indication for optimal type of drain device and optimal timing of removal of such drainage devices (including nasogastric tubes and urinary catheters)? The ERAS concept aims to remove nasogastric tubes immediately after the conclusion of elective surgery and minimize the use of drains. Where drains are essential, early removal is advocated. For the patient with major trauma, this early removal may be impossible due to the need for monitoring in the ICU or to allow for drainage of irritant fluids in the postinjury period. This may be a cause of delay to optimal mobilization and feeding. The sentinel publication on this topic was the 2008 Schein narrative review, which advocated for selective drain use and early, but appropriate removal [ To start with urinary (UC) and nasogastric (NGT) catheters, a pilot study of enhanced recovery protocols in Cape Town showed early removal of UC and NGT was possible, with a 2.5\u2010day reduction in hospital LOS; however, the study only included patients not requiring ICU\u2010admission [ Drainage for biliary or pancreatic leakage has been supported and also debated for many years. In the major trauma patient, the current opinion is guided mainly by retrospective single center studies and strong personal views; however, there is some moderate\u2010to\u2010low quality guidance available [https://doi.org/10.1002/wjs.70002). Drains do portend to higher complication rates but are also used in more severely injured patients. This is certainly true for combined pancreas and duodenal injury [ 16. Summary and recommendations: There is low quality evidence to support optimal positioning and the removal of all drains and catheters at the earliest appropriate time guided by patient stability and clinical need. Drains are not indicated for the routine drainage of the peritoneal cavity or in the presence small or large\u2010bowel anastomosis. In general, drains may be removed at less than 30 mL/day for pancreaticobiliary fistula. Nasogastric tube: low level of evidence/weak grade of recommendation Urinary drainage: moderate level of evidence/weak grade of recommendation Abdominal drains: low level of evidence/weak grade of recommendation 17. Abdominal closure tray and glove change PICO: Does the type of hand\u2010scrub or the changing of gloves and instruments on closure of open surgical sites reduce the surgical site sepsis? The need to reduce superficial SSI may be affected by the technique of surgical closure, with the use of antibiotic impregnated sutures not showing promise in this regard. How the surgeons clean their hands has traditionally been the mainstay of SSI prevention along with surgical site preparation [ 17. Summary and recommendations: There is high quality evidence to support using chlorhexidine hand\u2010scrub, changing of gloves, and using a new set of instruments for definitive sheath closure in abdominal surgery, whereas extrapolation to other surgical procedures can be cautiously advocated. Level of evidence: moderate Recommendation grade: weak 18. Type of temporary abdominal closure device and delayed closure PICO: 18a In trauma patients with an open abdomen, do commercial systems versus. homemade TAC have a preferential role? 18b What is the role of mesh\u2010mediated traction versus. skin only in delayed closure? Leaving the abdomen open using a temporary abdominal closure device (TAC) may be indicated in major trauma and nontrauma surgical emergencies such as abdominal sepsis, vascular surgical emergencies, and severe acute pancreatitis. Indications include prevention and treatment of abdominal compartment syndrome, and when a second laparotomy is planned or the abdominal wall cannot be closed. There is convincing evidence that any TAC should include some form of negative pressure wound therapy, whether homemade (such as the vac\u2010sandwich technique) or commercial devices are used [ If delayed more than 5\u20137 days, staged abdominal reconstruction methods include dynamic fascial traction systems combining mesh\u2010mediated traction with negative pressure wound therapy, yielding the highest primary fascial closure rates, and until a much later stage than the early TAC systems [ 18. Summary and recommendations: There is strong evidence that any TAC should include some form of negative pressure wound therapy, whether homemade or commercial. 18a. TAC should involve some form of negative pressure therapy Level of evidence: High Recommendation grade: Strong 18b. Abdominal reconstruction should be staged. Consider dynamic fascial traction systems with negative pressure therapy if patients tolerate it and the surgical expertize is available. There is moderate\u2010to\u2010strong evidence supporting staged abdominal reconstruction methods, including dynamic fascial traction systems, with negative pressure wound therapy in patients who tolerate it. Mesh\u2010mediated traction yields the highest primary fascial closure rates and until a much later stage than the early TAC systems. Level of evidence: moderate Recommendation grade: weak 19a. Resuscitation/use of blood products and coagulation management PICO: 19a What is the most appropriate choice of resuscitation fluids for trauma patients who require fluid resuscitation from the resuscitation phase to the postoperative phase? The principle of intravascular resuscitation through the trauma patients' journey from resuscitation to intensive care is to restore circulating volume using fluids, which resemble, as closely as is possible, the blood which has been lost, and to replace additionally depleted factors based on either protocolized administration of blood products or directed replacement depending on the results of ongoing testing [ The majority of trauma systems worldwide have specific protocols for transfusion of patients following major injury, usually including aspects of fluid restriction/permissive hypotension in the presurgical phase, with restoration of volume after hemorrhage control. These systems describe the activation; administration, use of ratios of packed red blood cells, plasma, and platelets; the use of coagulation adjuncts; the management of the metabolic factors, which contribute to normal coagulation; and the endpoints of resuscitation [ Retrospective analyses of civilian trauma registries and retrospective studies have shown an association between the use of whole blood and improved survival in trauma patients [ The optimum ratio of red cells to plasma is 1:1 during ongoing bleeding [ The use of crystalloid fluid resuscitation in trauma patients is associated with significant morbidity, especially in high doses [ Following hemorrhage control and patient transfer to an intensive care environment, the clinical focus shifts to a more directed approach to blood component therapy. In this regard, the patient's hemoglobin concentration can be specifically targeted and coagulation defects addressed separately [ 19a. Summary and recommendations: Trauma patients should be resuscitated according to a locally relevant massive transfusion protocol. This protocol should aim to restore, as near as possible, whole blood to the bleeding patient. As part of these protocols, plasma components should be administered as early as possible. Ideally, these should be guided by dynamic coagulation assays, such as thromboelastography, if available. Crystalloid should be used as a last resort. Following hemostasis, initial hemoglobin targets of greater than 9 g/dL are rational, especially where the patient has an associated brain injury, or is at risk of ongoing/rebleeding, or requires further surgery. Lower transfusion thresholds (7 g/dL) may be considered in the subsequent phases of care. Level of evidence: moderate Level of recommendation: strong 19b. PICO: What is the role for supplemental medications and procoagulant blood products in the trauma patient? Moderate fibrinolysis may be present in as many as half of all major trauma patients and, when present, is associated with increased mortality [ Early fibrinogen depletion is a hallmark feature of the coagulopathy found in patients following major injury and is associated with increased mortality [ In systems, which use testing\u2010directed transfusion protocols, point of care coagulation tests can guide the use of fibrinogen and factor concentrates. This allows for the near normalization of the patients' coagulation profile [ 19b. Summary and recommendations: The use of tranexamic acid should be considered in different trauma systems depending on prehospital transfer times and access to point of care coagulation tests or dynamic coagulation assays, such as thromboelastography, if available. Cryoprecipitate is not beneficial given empirically in the early phase, whereas fibrinogen and other factor concentrates, may be administered based on tests of coagulation, as close to the point of care as possible. Level of evidence: high Level of recommendation: strong 20. Ventilation in the operation room PICO: What is the best management strategy for trauma patients in the operating theater\u2014Does ARDSnet apply prior to ICU admission? Ventilator management strategies for trauma patients in the operating theater are aimed at preventing lung injury, optimizing oxygenation and ventilation, and reducing complications. According to a systematic review by Jaber et al. (2012), the main strategies include protective lung ventilation, individualized positive end\u2010expiratory pressure (PEEP), and recruitment maneuvers [2O), and limiting plateau pressure (< 30 cm H2O). This approach reduces the risk of ventilator\u2010induced lung injury and atelectasis, improving oxygenation and compliance. However, there is some evidence in trauma that allowing up to 10 mL/kg is better for reversal of metabolic acidosis and has no worse outcomes on the lungs [ A recent meta\u2010analysis included 17 RCTs (2250 patients). A higher driving pressure (the difference between PEEP and plateau pressure) was associated with the development of postoperative pulmonary complications (OR: 1.16, 95% CI: 1.13\u20131.19, and p < 0.0001). Increased PEEP that results in an increase in driving pressure is associated with more postoperative pulmonary complications (OR: 3.11, 95% CI: 1.39\u20136.96, and p = 0.006) [ 20. Summary and recommendations: Evidence exists for optimal ventilator management of the trauma patient in the operating room. Best practices do include low\u2010to\u2010moderate tidal volume (6\u20138 mL/kg), moderate adjusted PEEP (5\u20138 cm H2O), and low driving pressures (< 15 cm H2O), although up to 10 mL/kg tidal volume may be considered acceptable in the operation room environment. Level of evidence: high Grade of recommendation: strong 21. PICO: What is the best ventilator strategy for trauma patients requiring mechanical ventilation in ICU? Ventilator management is a critical component of care for trauma patients who require intensive care admission. The optimal settings and strategies for ventilator management may differ depending on the location of care, such as the operating room (OR) or the intensive care unit (ICU). Though not specific to trauma patients, several studies examined pulmonary complication risk in the perioperative period of major abdominal surgery. A multicenter RCT by Futier compared protective ventilation with conventional ventilation in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery and found that protective ventilation reduced the occurrence of major pulmonary and extrapulmonary complications (RR: 0.40, 95% CI: 0.24 to 0.68, and p = 0.001) as well as the duration of mechanical ventilation and hospital stay (mean \u22122.45 days, 95% CI: \u22124.17 to \u22120.72, and p = 0.006) [p = 0.64) [ 21. Summary and recommendations: Best practices are based on those patients undergoing major abdominal surgery. This includes low tidal volume (6\u20137 mL/kg), moderate PEEP, and low driving pressure (< 15 cm H2O). Level of evidence: moderate Grade of recommendation: strong 22. PICO: Is there a role for ECMO in the management of trauma patients compared to no ECMO? Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a form of mechanical circulatory support that provides oxygenation and/or hemodynamic support to patients with severe respiratory and/or cardiac failure. ECMO has been increasingly used in various clinical scenarios, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), cardiogenic shock, and cardiac arrest. Historically, the role of ECMO in trauma patients was controversial due to multiple injuries (e.g., brain injury) and hemorrhage risk [ According to the international ECMO registry, ARDS is the most common indication for ECMO in trauma patients [ 22. Summary and recommendations: ECMO should be considered a viable option for severely injured trauma patients that require advanced mechanical ventilatory support. Level of evidence: moderate Grade of recommendation: strong 23. PICO: What is the role of noninvasive ventilation as a rescue therapy in the trauma patient versus invasive ventilation? Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is a mode of respiratory support that delivers positive pressure to the airways without the need for an invasive airway. NIV has been widely used in the management of acute respiratory failure due to various causes, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. The main advantages of NIV are that it avoids the complications of invasive ventilation, such as VILI, barotrauma, and VAP, and preserves the patient's ability to cough, communicate, and swallow. However, the role of NIV in the trauma patient is less clear, as there are potential benefits and risks associated with its use. A patient should always be awake enough to be able to remove the mask. A systematic review studying NIV in trauma patients showed that in the appropriate population, attempts were feasible but only if immediate invasive endotracheal intubation were available for nonresponders [2:FiO2 < 300 either < 48 h or > 48 h of admission. The study was stopped at 2 years due to futility with no significant difference in risk of intubation (OR: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.20\u20132.43, and p = 0.60). Similarly, there were no differences in the risk of pneumonia or ARDS [ 23. Summary and recommendations: The use of noninvasive ventilation as a primary or rescue therapy in trauma patients is an option either as primary or a step\u2010down therapy. NIV appears to be a safe option for most patients and should not be reserved only for those with high\u2010risk injury, such as flail chest and a high thoracic injury score, who may fail and benefit from the NIV step\u2010down approach. Level of evidence: low Grade of recommendation: weak 24. PICO: What is the best respiratory support for trauma patients with pulmonary contusion after initial assessment? Pulmonary contusion (PC) is a common and potentially life\u2010threatening complication of blunt chest trauma. PC is characterized by hemorrhage and edema in the lung parenchyma, leading to impaired gas exchange and respiratory failure. Respiratory support is a key component of the management of PC, but the optimal strategy remains controversial [ A judicious balanced fluid resuscitation that minimizes excessive crystalloid remains a best practice. NIV may be attempted in select patient populations, though it tends to fail among those with flail chest and high rib injury scores. Invasive mechanical ventilation is indicated for patients with PC who have severe hypoxemia, hypercapnia, respiratory acidosis, or respiratory distress. The main goals of invasive ventilation are to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation, reduce the work of breathing, and prevent further lung injury. The main challenges of invasive ventilation are to avoid ventilator\u2010induced lung injury (VILI), barotrauma, and ventilator\u2010associated pneumonia (VAP). A lung\u2010protective strategy including low\u2010tidal volume (6\u20138 mL/kg of predicted body weight), moderate positive end\u2010expiratory pressure (PEEP) (8\u201315 cm H2O, [1/5 of FiO2]), and permissive hypercapnia (in those without concomitant TBI). Such a strategy decreases the risk of ARDS, a common complication of PC. NIV (including high flow nasal cannula) can provide respiratory support for patients with PC who have mild\u2010to\u2010moderate hypoxemia, respiratory distress, or failure of oxygen therapy. The main advantages of NIV are that it avoids the complications of invasive ventilation, such as VILI, barotrauma, and VAP, and preserves the patient's ability to cough, communicate, and swallow. 24. Summary and recommendations: Trauma patients who sustain a pulmonary contusion should have judicious use of crystalloid to prevent worsening hypoxemia. General supportive measures utilizing both NIV and lung protective strategies may be implemented, whereas invasive ventilation is the best for severe lung contusion meeting ARDSnet criteria. Level of evidence: low Grade of recommendation: weak 25. PICO: What is the role for neuromuscular blockade agents in trauma patients in ICU versus nil? Neuromuscular blockade agents (NMBAs) are commonly used in the intensive care unit (ICU) for various indications, such as facilitating mechanical ventilation, reducing oxygen consumption, preventing shivering, and as an adjunct to ARDS treatment, while being part of the medical management of abdominal hypertension. However, the use of NMBAs in critically ill trauma patients can be associated with several risks and controversies. The evidence for the use of NMBAs in trauma patients is limited and conflicting. One systematic review suggested that NMBAs may improve outcomes in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), by reducing intracranial pressure and cerebral metabolic rate, and preventing secondary brain injury [ The evidence for the use of NMBAs in patients with other types of trauma, such as chest, abdominal, or spinal trauma, is even more scarce and inconclusive. NMBAs should be used only when indicated and after considering the alternatives, such as adequate sedation and analgesia. NMBAs should be used in the lowest effective dose and for the shortest possible duration, to minimize the adverse effects and the development of tolerance or resistance. The recent ROSE trial suggests that facilitation with NMBAs be subjected to 48 h of duration, and a recent guideline additionally advocated using bolus dosing and not continuous infusions [ 25. Summary and recommendations: NMBAs could be used in the appropriate setting for trauma patients, but should be limited to bolus dosing for a maximum of 48 h duration. All patients should have BIS monitoring, if available, when paralyzed to ensure adequate depth of sedation. Level of evidence: moderate Grade of recommendation: weak Aspiration Pneumonia 26. PICO: In the trauma ICU patient who has an episode of aspiration, either during the resuscitation or later phases of care, what is the current best practice management and what is the role of bronchoscopy or antimicrobials in the management thereof? Aspiration of gastric contents, due to regurgitation and vomiting, the presence of nasoenteric tubes or loss of airway reflexes (resulting from low level of consciousness) is a distinct risk during the initial assessment phase, operative induction phase, and during ICU care [ 26. Summary and recommendations: Aspiration Pneumonia Aspiration pneumonia is distinct from pneumonia caused by infection. There is moderate level evidence to perform early bronchoscopy, lavage, and suction in these patients to allow differentiation and correct management. Antibiotics should not be routinely used until there is suspicion or evidence of infection. Level of evidence for bronchoscopic lavage and suction: Moderate Grade of recommendation: Strong Level of evidence in delaying use of antibiotics unless evidence of infection: Moderate Grade of recommendation: Strong 27. Analgesia/sedation and withdrawal 27a. Analgesia and sedation (analgosedation) options in the trauma patient in ICU 27a1. PICO: In trauma patients in the ICU, what are the options for optimal analgesia and sedation to enhance recovery and early ICU mobility? There are multiple drugs used in ICU for induction, intubation, and continuing analgosedation: benzodiazepines, ketamine, propofol, dexmedetomidine, clonidine, and opioids, either alone or in combination [ Modern practice aims to reduce opioid and benzodiazepine exposure and replacing these drugs with suitable alternatives [ 27a2. PICO: Is ketamine a suitable combination with, or replacement for, propofol and opioids, or dexmedetomidine, for analgosedation in trauma patients in ICU? Ketamine is an old drug that has recently shown a resurgence in use given it has both a sedative and analgesic effect with lower side effects on the hemodynamic system than opioids, propofol, or benzodiazepines [ Regarding intubation drugs for trauma ICU intubation, there is conflicting evidence, with some studies showing no overt outcome difference between ketamine, etomidate, or propofol, whereas other studies, more likely to include septic patients found etomidate to have higher mortality, but this was not found in purely trauma\u2010populations [ 27a3. PICO: Is ketamine safe in polytrauma with TBI? Although the level of evidence for the use of ketamine sedation in TBI is based on small observational studies or small\u2010randomized studies with methodological concerns, it appears that ketamine is safe and does not increase intracranial pressure in patients with TBI polytrauma [ 27a4. PICO: What additional alternative opioid\u2010sparing analgesia options exist for selected patients reduced ileus in trauma patients? Ketamine and dexmedetomidine combined with intravenous paracetamol (acetaminophen) are commonly used to reduce opioid analgesia requirements in multimodal analgesia or analgosedation protocols in ICU. Nonsteroidal agents may be safe after 72 h postresuscitation provided there is no renal dysfunction or other risks for gastric bleeding. There is no convincing evidence of reduced fracture healing in modern studies [ Another option that has recently come to prominence, especially in the context of ileus prevention or reduction is the use of intravenous lignocaine (lidocaine) infusions for pain relief. A recent systematic review of selected randomized controlled trials aimed to describe the pharmacokinetics, antinociceptive effects, antihyperalgesic effects, anti\u2010inflammatory effects, potential side effects, and to place the role of intravenous lidocaine in early postoperative pain management. Although the exact mechanism of action remains unclear, there are numerous theories. What seems clear is that the optimal dosing includes a loading dose of 1\u20132 mg/kg, followed by 1\u20132 mg/kg/h continuous infusion during early postoperative pain control and this clearly improves analgesia [ 27a5. PICO: How should opioids be weaned in TICU to prevent dependence? The opioid crisis in the high\u2010income countries has resulted in a search for alternative multimodal analgesia pathways; however, dependence is higher in those with \u201cbreakthrough\u201d pain. A weaning protocol is recommended with the suggestion of decreasing the infusion rate by 20%\u201340%, followed by 10% every 12\u201324 h in patients at low risk of opioid withdrawal or 5%\u201310% reduction in dose per day in patients who have received high\u2010dose opioids for greater than 5 days, with patients on high\u2010dose fentanyl infusions more prone to withdrawal\u2010syndromes in ICU [ 27a6. PICO: What is the optimal analgosedation weaning protocol for planned extubation in ICU to avoid prolonged ventilation of trauma patients? There is extremely limited evidence and none specific to trauma ICU to answer this question, but one study suggests that for an exclusively surgical patient population, the implementation of a combined protocol of spontaneous awakening and spontaneous breathing increased the rate of successful extubation [ 27a. Summary and recommendations: Multimodal analgesia\u2010focused analgosedation incorporating nonopioid and nonbenzodiazepine drugs are recommended, with sedation levels monitored using a validated tool. Ketamine is a safe and effective primary analgosedation option, either with propofol or dexmedetomidine, or combined with rocuronium and fentanyl for intubation. Ketamine is a safe option, even for TBI patients and does not increase intracranial pressure. Dexmedetomidine and lignocaine infusions are newer safe adjuncts for opioid and benzodiazepine sparing in ICU, with advantages during weaning, which should be protocolized. 27a. Level of evidence: low Grade of recommendation: weak 27b. Withdrawal from drugs and substances in ICU trauma patients PICO: In trauma patients in the ICU, which drugs and substances are associated with withdrawal syndromes and what is the best options to prevent and treat these withdrawal episodes? Drug and alcohol withdrawal syndromes have varied incidence in ICU populations; however, trauma patients appear to have a higher risk [ 27b. Summary and recommendation: Preventing substance withdrawal is challenging with many confounding aspects and there are numerous options for treatment with clinical response to be assessed. Protocols improve outcome. Level of evidence: moderate Grade of evidence: strong 28. Thromboprophylaxis and holding of doses PICO: When should thromboprophylaxis in trauma patients commence and what type of prophylaxis is best in those without and with TBI? What is the role and timing of thromboprophylaxis in patients undergoing nonoperative management of high\u2010grade solid organ injuries? In trauma patients in the ICU, is there a role of screening for VTE? Is the potential benefit of withholding thromboprophylaxis prior to surgery outweighed by the risk of VTE complications? The authors quote and endorse the recently published trauma chapter of the European guidelines on perioperative venous thromboembolism prophylaxis [ 28a1. There is strong evidence to support early initiation of thromboprophylaxis in patients with no brain injury: Thromboprophylaxis should be initiated early (< 24 h) after severe trauma without brain injury and in the absence of active hemorrhage Level of evidence: high Grade of evidence: strong 28a2. For nonoperative management (NOM) of blunt solid organ injuries, VTE rates decrease consistently with early thromboprophylaxis but, based on conflicting results concerning delayed bleeding risk, some high\u2010risk patients might benefit from a 48 h delay.

Relevant papers vary widely in design and quality. One prospective randomized single center study enrolled high\u2010risk trauma patients to US screening on days 1, 3, and 7 (n = 995) versus no screening (n = 994) and found fewer PEs and more DVTs in the US group [ There is very limited evidence on the effect of withholding TP doses prior to procedures. Louis et al. published a prospective observational study focusing on DVT and relation with missed doses of TP [ 28b. Summary and recommendation: 28c1. We conditionally recommend routine US DVT screening in high\u2010risk trauma patients in ICU as per local guidelines. Level of evidence: low Grade of recommendation: weak 28c2. There is also moderate evidence to question the rationale for withholding LMWH doses for interventions other than neurosurgery or spinal procedures. Existing limited evidence suggests that withholding thromboprophylaxis doses before surgery increases DVT rates. Level of evidence: low Grade of recommendation: strong 29. Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT) 29a. PICO: Does the timing (early vs. late) of RRT in trauma ICU patients impact on outcome? Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a frequent complication of trauma, affecting up to 30% of patients admitted to the ICU. AKI is associated with increased mortality, morbidity, and length of stay in the ICU. Renal replacement therapy (RRT) is a life\u2010saving intervention that can restore fluid and electrolyte balance, remove toxins, and support renal recovery in patients with AKI. However, the optimal indications and timing of RRT initiation for trauma patients with AKI remain controversial and depend on several factors, such as the severity of AKI, the presence of other organ failures, the risk of complications, and the availability of resources. Indications of RRT for trauma patients with AKI are similar to those for other critically ill patients with AKI. The most common indications are volume overload, refractory acidosis, hyperkalemia, uremic complications, and intoxications. However, specific considerations for trauma patients include: (1) the potential for ongoing hemorrhage and coagulopathy, which may increase the risk of bleeding complications from RRT; (2) the need for aggressive fluid resuscitation and blood transfusion, which may exacerbate volume overload and worsen AKI; (3) the presence of rhabdomyolysis, which may cause severe hyperkalemia, acidosis, and myoglobinuria, and require high\u2010volume RRT; and (4) the occurrence of abdominal compartment syndrome, which may impair renal perfusion and function, and necessitate early RRT to reduce intra\u2010abdominal pressure. The timing of RRT initiation for trauma patients with AKI is a matter of debate and depends on the balance between the potential benefits and harms of early versus late RRT. Several RCTs and meta\u2010analyses have been performed to examine the timing of RRT (early vs. late). Based on low\u2010to\u2010moderate evidence, early initiation of RRT had no beneficial effect on 30\u2010day mortality (12 studies, 4826 patients RR: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.87 to 1.09, I 2 = 29%, or death after 30 days (7 studies, 4534 participants: RR: 0.99, 95% CI: 0.92 to 1.07, and I 2 = 6%) [I 2 = 10%; ICU LOS \u22121.01 days, 95% CI: \u22121.60 to \u22120.42; I 2 = 0%). 29a. Summary and recommendations: Early initiation of RRT in critically ill trauma patients does not confer improved survival. However, patients who undergo early RRT will have a shorter length of ICU and hospital stay, with a risk of more adverse events. Traditional indications for RRT are best followed, but initiated sooner than later. Level of evidence: moderate Grade of recommendation: weak 29b. PICO: What is the optimal type (CRRT vs. SLEDD vs. IHD) of RRT and current best practice indications for RRT in trauma ICU patients with AKI? The severely injured patient after major trauma is at high risk to develop renal impairment [ The one specific area of trauma\u2010related AKI that has unique aspects is related to crush/reperfusion syndrome with two types of syndrome, namely the anaerobic ischemia\u2010reperfusion syndrome and the anaerobic primary myorenal syndrome. Diagnosis is assisted with the use of lactate and venous bicarbonate levels [ 29b. Summary and recommendations: There is no clear RRT therapy that is better than another, except for intermittent hemodialysis being poorly tolerated. An indication\u2010based approach is recommended, with liberal early initiation of RRT, earlier than traditional values. For crush/reperfusion syndrome, there may be a place for early fluid restriction if anuric and early RRT. Mannitol and bicarbonate therapy are unnecessary and do not prevent the need for RRT. Level of evidence: high Grade of recommendation: strong 30. Feeding/Bowel function in trauma ICU patients In general, the existing nutritional guidelines for ICU patients, which include trauma patients, as issued by the American and European societies of enteral and parenteral nutrition (ASPEN/ESPEN) groups are comprehensive and supported [ 30a. PICO: What is the optimal timing of feeding in the critically ill trauma patient with continuous gut? Nutritional support for critically injured patients is of paramount importance for short\u2010 and long\u2010term outcomes. In trauma patients, the preadmission nutritional state, type, and severity of the injury (\u2010ies) and surgical interventions undertaken, makes the decision of the route for feeding, dose, composition of supplementation, and the timing of initiation of nutrition support a complex decision. For the trauma patient with continuous gut, the guidelines for critical care nutrition from the various international nutrition societies are recommended as the best practice standard [ The advantages of starting enteral nutrition (EN) compared to parenteral nutrition (PN) early postsurgery and ICU admission have been well established. Parenteral nutrition is associated with increased inflammation and stress response, perturbations in glycemic control, and disruption in the microbiome when compared to EN. Nevertheless, early PN is recommended in cases where there is contraindication for EN or in patients who are malnourished before admission. The ESPEN critical care guidelines recommend PN initiation within 3\u20137 days for all patients where EN was contraindicated (e.g., GI dysfunction) and sooner (within 24\u201348 h) in those with documented malnutrition [ Gastric feeding carries low risk for the dreaded complications of aspiration and pneumonia, thus early trial of feeding should be undertaken with lower doses of infusion. Postpyloric tube placement can be considered in high risk patients with aspiration, altered mental status, dysphagia, high residual volume, nausea, vomiting, or failed gastric feeding [ 30a. Summary and recommendations: There is good quality evidence to support early enteral feeding using a gradual incremental protocol with nasoenteric feeding reserved for those who have gastroparesis or feed intolerance, with the routine use of prokinetics and adjunctive treatments recommended. Following established nutrition, society guidelines are supported for this goal. For planned surgery, clear carbohydrate liquids till 2 h preoperative are recommended to avoid prolonged preoperative starvation in those tolerating enteral feed. Level of evidence: high Grade of recommendation: strong 30b. PICO: In trauma patients with discontinuous gut, what are the optimal feeding strategies and timing of feeding? Discontinuous gut (\u201cclip and drop\u201d) of bowel ends is a well\u2010described part of damage control surgery. Although the gut remains discontinuous and where this involves duodenum, small bowel, and proximal large bowel, we recommend early consideration for parenteral nutrition starting around day 3 provided physiological improvement had occurred and the resuscitation phase is complete. Once gut continuity has been restored early enteral feeding within 6\u20138 h with a trickle\u2010feed approach is supported in the existing critical care nutrition literature [ 30b. Summary and recommendation: Commence enteral nutrition (oral or tube\u2010feed) within 6\u20138 h postsurgery (trickle\u2010feed) once gut is continuous. Use parenteral nutrition by day 3\u20135 in those unable to achieve continuity of gut. Level of evidence: moderate Grade of recommendation: weak 30c. PICO: To improve access to early enteral nutrition what therapies to prevent or treat postoperative nausea and vomiting or acute colonic ileus (\u201cOgilvie\u2010type\u201d) are best in trauma patients? Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) along with the onset of acute colonic dilatation are common reasons for delayed feeding in nonventilated trauma patients. Trauma patients fit the high\u2010risk group for PONV. For the management of PONV, the recommended therapies include multimodal and regional analgesia, parenteral paracetamol, dexmedetomidine, lidocaine infusion, dexamethasone early during surgery, and droperidol or ondansetron at the end of surgery. The recent guidelines are a consensus of multiple societies and we support this guideline [ 30c. Summary and recommendations There is moderate quality evidence to support the prophylactic administration of multimodal therapies to prevent PONV and ileus and to identify and treat ileus or pseudo\u2010obstruction in ICU. Level of evidence: moderate Grade of recommendation: weak 30d. PICO: In trauma patients who undergo planned operative intervention from the ICU or the general ward does carbohydrate loading improve outcome? ERAS protocols advocate reduced fasting times pre\u2010elective surgery with the use of carbohydrate drinks to attenuate the inflammatory response and improve insulin requirements [ 30d. Summary and recommendation: There is some evidence to support carbohydrate loading in the planned surgery patient with continuous gut and improving outcomes, with no adverse events. Level of evidence: low Grade of recommendation: weak 30e. PICO: In patients after trauma who are intubated, does the feed need to be stopped more than 2 h prior to planned extubation? This is a controversial aspect of critical care with many authors recommending between 4 and 6 h of fasting prior to planned extubation; however, several more recent studies have questioned this practice [ 30e. Summary and recommendation: Weak evidence exists for reduced feed\u2010stoppage prior to extubation exists, and we recommend this decision be individualized per patient and in light of the underlying pathology and aspiration risk. Level of evidence: low Grade of recommendation: weak 31. Temperature Management 31. PICO: In trauma patients what is the role of optimal temperature management in those with coagulopathy, hypothermia or post traumatic cardiac arrest? Regulated temperature management is established as an adjunct in postcardiac arrest care; however, optimal temperature control in the Trauma ICU patient is less well defined [ In polytrauma patients without TBI, the recommendation of maintaining normothermia between 36.5\u00b0C and 38.3\u00b0C is based on current general ICU strategies [ 31. Summary and recommendations: The overall aim of perioperative management is to achieve and maintain normothermia. If the patient has had a prolonged cardiac arrest/loss of cerebral perfusion, targeted temperature management (TTM) may be beneficial provided the patient's circulation is stable enough and bleeding is controlled. Hyperthermia (temp > 38\u00b0C) is known to be detrimental in brain injury. Level of evidence: moderate Recommendation grade: strong 32. Mobilization PICO: In trauma patients, what are the indications and, are there contraindications, to early mobilization after trauma (except severe TBI and orthopedic restrictions) in ICU? Early mobilization of patients in the ICU is a strategy that aims to reduce the complications of prolonged bed rest, such as muscle weakness, delirium, and ventilator\u2010associated pneumonia. However, the feasibility and safety of early mobilization for patients who require mechanical ventilation and have suffered trauma is unclear. When excluding severe TBI and specific restrictions for orthopedic injuries, early mobilization of patients is seen as beneficial and very seldom contraindicated, even during the critical care phase [ Though not specific to trauma patients, a Cochrane analysis included general ICU patients who underwent a mobilization program (4 RCTs and 690 patients). Based on low quality evidence, there was insufficient evidence to comment on the effect of early mobilization. This was due to mostly small sample size, lack of blinding, and variability in interventions and outcomes used to measure their effect size [ A systematic review of early mobilization among ICU trauma patients by Higgins et al. examined mortality, ventilator duration, ICU, and hospital LOS. Early mobilization was associated with decreased ventilator days (mean difference \u22121.18 days and 95% CI: \u22122.17 to \u22120.19). There was no difference in overall hospital mortality, ICU, or hospital LOS [p = 0.005)) [ 32. Summary and recommendation: Trauma patients in the ICU who undergo a protocolized early mobilization program will have fewer days of mechanical ventilation. However, there is low quality evidence that early mobilization decreases the risk of delirium but is associated with more adverse events in ICU. Level of evidence: moderate Grade of recommendation: strong", "type": "Document"}

In several recent studies, obesity was not associated with increased mortality; however, it was associated with a prolonged requirement for mechanical ventilation, tracheostomy and prolonged length of stay in a critical care unit Airway interventions in the obese are associated with an increased risk of hypoxia and complications and should only be undertaken by appropriately skilled personnel. Many would advocate an early tracheostomy if long\u2010term airway management is anticipated. Custom\u2010made tracheostomy tubes with an adjustable flange may be required to ensure an adequate length to reach the trachea. Tracheostomies are usually performed in the intensive care unit using a percutaneous approach, but surgical placement may be considered, depending on the experience of the available medical staff. For mechanical ventilation, ideal body weight is used to calculate the initial recommended tidal volume of 5\u20137 ml.kg\u22121, ensuring the peak inspiratory pressure remains < 35 cmH2O Enteral absorption of drugs is not altered in the morbidly obese. However, owing to the altered pharmacokinetics, monitoring of serum levels is considered more important in this group of patients to ensure that drug levels remain within the therapeutic range Prophylaxis against VTE is vitally important for the morbidly obese patient in critical care and should follow the guidelines given above. All critically ill patients are prone to develop protein malnutrition as a result of metabolic stress and despite having excess fat stores, the morbidly obese are no different.

There may be delays caused by difficulties in placement of defibrillator pads, establishment of vascular access or securing an effective airway. Physical and biological factors related to obesity may affect the quality of chest compressions delivered, the efficacy of administered vasoactive drugs or the efficacy of defibrillator shocks applied, because none of these measures are standardised to a patient's BMI. The American Heart Association has concluded that no alterations to resuscitation have been shown to affect outcome Inspiratory airway pressures will be higher than normal, and excessive leak with supraglottic airway devices may mean that chest compressions will have to be paused to enable ventilation (i.e. a standard 30:2 compression\u2010ventilation ratio). The high airway pressures that can occur during resuscitation of very obese patients may impair coronary perfusion pressure and ultimately reduce the chance of survival Chest compressions will be difficult to perform in many patients, simply because of suboptimal positioning of rescuers. A step or platform may be required, or compressions can be performed from the patients\u2019 head end. Recommended defibrillation energies remain unaltered in the morbidly obese, though there is evidence that the thoracic impedance is higher If intravenous access is difficult, the intraosseous route for drug delivery is recommended.
