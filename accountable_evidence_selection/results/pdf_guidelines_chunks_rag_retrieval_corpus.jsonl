In addition, better risk stratification methods in older individuals using improved risk equations derived from diverse cohorts, new imaging modalities or new biomarkers may further enhance ASCVD prediction allowing better targeting of those at greatest risk.

Potentially inappropriate medications may often be prescribed on the basis of symptoms rather than diagnoses, such as when a medication is used to treat the symptoms of insomnia, anxiety, rhinorrhea, or pain without having a confirmed diagnosis of the underlying disease process  [3, 4] . For this reason, a number of alternative therapies in this list are organized by symptom rather than by diagnosis. Yet, clinical practice guidelines and related documents are typically organized by diagnosis, which can create challenges in transposing their guidance in a manner that reflects the realities and diagnostic uncertainties of busy clinical practice.

The year-on-year reduction in general mortality has been reversed in the USA with opioid misuse being a major component of the increase in mortality  [1] . One study found that the percentage of all deaths attributable to opioids increased by 292% (from 0.4% to 1.5%) between 2001 and 2016  [2] . Opioids are used widely intraoperatively and, used safely and appropriately, still play an important role in postoperative analgesia. Nonetheless, the post-surgical use of opioids is thought to be an important source of problems.

To implement this recommendation, specialties and hospitals that do not currently provide an ERP covering all 3 stages of perioperative care for patients having major or complex elective surgery will need to restructure their surgical care. This might have an initial resource impact, although some features of an ERP, such as early mobilisation and early intake of food and fluids, are current practice in many hospitals.

Acute pain, a nearly universal experience, is a physiologic response to noxious stimuli that can become pathologic. Acute pain is usually sudden in onset and time limited (defined in this clinical practice guideline as having a duration of <1 month) and often is caused by injury, trauma, or medical treatments such as surgery  (2, 3) . Unresolved acute pain or subacute pain (defined in this clinical practice guideline as pain that has been present for 1-3 months) can evolve into chronic pain  (4) . Chronic pain typically lasts >3 months  (4)  and can be the result of an underlying medical disease or condition, injury, medical treatment, inflammation, or unknown cause  (2) . Approximately one in five U.S. adults had chronic pain in 2019 and approximately one in  14", "type": "Document"}

Pain, especially chronic pain, can affect almost every aspect of a person's life, leading to impaired physical functioning, poor mental health, and reduced quality of life, and contributes to substantial morbidity each year  (6) . In 2011, the economic costs of chronic pain were estimated to range from $560 to $635 billion in annual direct medical costs, lost productivity, and disability  (2) .

Before starting ongoing opioid therapy for patients with subacute or chronic pain, clinicians should work with patients to establish treatment goals for pain and function and consider how opioid therapy will be discontinued if benefits do not outweigh risks. When opioids are initiated, clinicians should prescribe the lowest effective dosage of immediate-release opioids for no longer than needed for the expected duration of pain severe enough to require opioids. During ongoing opioid therapy, clinicians should collaborate with patients to evaluate and carefully weigh benefits and risks of continuing opioid therapy and exercise care when increasing, continuing, or reducing opioid dosage.

Before reversing a taper, clinicians should carefully assess and discuss with patients benefits and risks of increasing opioid dosage. If the clinician and patient have determined that the goal is discontinuing opioids, after the smallest available dose is reached, the interval between doses can be extended and opioids can be stopped when taken less frequently than once a day. More rapid tapers might be needed for patient safety under certain circumstances (e.g., for patients who have experienced overdose on their current dosage)  (219) . However, unless there are indications of a life-threatening issue, such as warning signs of impending overdose, opioid therapy should not be discontinued abruptly, and clinicians should not rapidly reduce opioid dosages from higher dosages.

Over the past few decades, the utilization of telehealth services has grown, with exponential growth during the COVID-19 pandemic when sheltering at home was advised. The number of clinicians and patients participating in telehealth rose sharply in 2020. About 14% of older adults reported that their clinician offered telehealth visits in May 2019, while that number rose to 62% by June 2020  [1] . Around that same time in 2020, telehealth accounted for about 50% of all primary care visits among Medicare beneficiaries [2].

The exponential growth in telehealth during COVID-19 occurred when, in response to the public health emergency which included recommendations that the public shelter in place, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) relaxed regulations and enabled easier reimbursement  [5] . Specifically, CMS approved temporary waivers, enabling reimbursement for both video and audio visits as a mechanism for ensuring that people had access to their clinicians for both routine and emergency care needs. Subsequently, the advantages of telehealth have become apparent from this more widespread use.
