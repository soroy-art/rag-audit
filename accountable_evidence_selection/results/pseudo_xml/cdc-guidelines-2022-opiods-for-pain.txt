<docTitle>CDC Clinical Practice Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Pain -United States, 2022</docTitle>

<sectionHeader>Introduction Background</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>Pain is one of the most common reasons adults seek medical care in the United States</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>adults</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>Corresponding author: Division of Overdose Prevention, National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, CDC. Email: cdcinfo@cdc.gov. experienced "high-impact" chronic pain, defined as having pain on most days or every day during the past 3 months that limited life or work activities</paragraph>
<paragraph>Pain is a complex phenomenon influenced by multiple factors, including biologic, psychological, and social factors</paragraph>
<paragraph>Although substantial opportunity exists for improved pain management broadly across the United States, data underscore opportunities for addressing specific, long-standing health disparities</paragraph>
<paragraph>Because of the clinical, psychological, and social consequences associated with pain, including limitations in activities, lost work productivity, reduced quality of life, and pervasive stigma, it is essential that clinicians have the training, education, guidance, and resources to provide appropriate, holistic, and compassionate care for patients with pain</paragraph>
<paragraph>The range of therapeutic options has historically been inaccessible to many patients because of factors such as inadequate clinician education, training, and guidance; unconscious bias; a shortage of pain management specialists; insufficient access to treatment modalities such as behavioral therapy; siloed health systems; insurance coverage and reimbursement policies; and lack of clarity about the evidence supporting different pain treatments</paragraph>
<paragraph>Opioids can be essential medications for the management of pain; however, they carry considerable potential risk. A systematic review published in 2014 by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) found insufficient evidence to demonstrate long-term benefits of prescription opioid treatment for chronic pain, and long-term prescription opioid use was found to be associated with increased risk for overdose and opioid misuse, among other risks</paragraph>
<paragraph>In addition to the potential risks to patients, prescribed opioids have the potential for diversion and nonmedical use among persons to whom they were not prescribed</paragraph>
<paragraph>CDC recognized the need for a national guideline on pain management that could improve appropriate opioid prescribing while minimizing opioid-related risks and released the CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain -United States, 2016 (referred to as the 2016 CDC Opioid Prescribing Guideline hereafter). The 2016 CDC Opioid Prescribing Guideline included 12 recommendations for the prescribing of opioids for chronic pain by primary care clinicians in outpatient settings, excluding active cancer treatment, palliative care, and end-of-life care</paragraph>
<paragraph>The number of overall opioid prescriptions in the United States declined after 2012, and further declines have been observed after the release of the 2016 CDC Opioid Prescribing Guideline</paragraph>
<paragraph>Although some laws, regulations, and policies that appear to support recommendations in the 2016 CDC Opioid Prescribing Guideline might have had positive results for some patients, they are inconsistent with a central tenet of the guideline: that the recommendations are voluntary and intended to be flexible to support, not supplant, individualized, patient-centered care. Of particular concern, some policies purportedly drawn from the 2016 CDC Opioid Prescribing Guideline have been notably inconsistent with it and have gone well beyond its clinical recommendations</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Rationale</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>Since release of the 2016 CDC Opioid Prescribing Guideline, new evidence has emerged on the benefits and risks of prescription opioids for both acute and chronic pain, comparisons with nonopioid pain treatments, dosing strategies, opioid dose-dependent effects, risk mitigation strategies, and opioid tapering and discontinuation</paragraph>
<paragraph>Opioid medications remain a common treatment for pain despite declines in the number of opioid prescriptions after 2012</paragraph>
<paragraph>CDC developed a draft clinical practice guideline on the basis of five systematic reviews of the best-available evidence on the benefits and risks of prescription opioids, nonopioid pharmacologic treatments, and nonpharmacologic treatments. The draft clinical practice guideline was reviewed by an independent federal advisory committee (the Board of Scientific Counselors of the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control), peer reviewers, and the public and was revised after feedback from these reviews. Additional insights from patients, caregivers, and clinicians shared during virtual conversations held in 2020 were incorporated in the update. Importantly, to discourage the misapplication of opioid pain medication dosage thresholds as inflexible standards, revised recommendation statement language emphasizes principles such as avoiding increasing dosage above levels likely to yield diminishing returns in benefits relative to risks to patients. More-specific considerations related to dosage have been moved to implementation considerations that follow each recommendation statement, where more nuance is offered to inform clinical decision-making and individualized patient care.</paragraph>
<paragraph>This clinical practice guideline provides recommendations but does not replace clinical judgment and individualized, patient-centered decision-making. The recommendations are based on emerging evidence, including observational studies or randomized clinical trials with notable limitations; thus, they should be considered in the context of the clinician-patient relationship built on shared understanding and a whole-person approach that considers such factors as the patient's physical and psychological functioning, support needs, expected health outcomes and well-being, home environment, and home and work responsibilities. Flexibility for clinicians and patients is paramount when making patient-centered clinical treatment decisions. The recommendations aim to improve US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ) and provides evidence-based recommendations for primary care and other clinicians (including physicians, nurse practitioners and other advanced practice registered nurses, physician assistants, and oral health practitioners) providing pain care, including those prescribing opioids, for outpatients aged ≥18 years with acute (duration of <1 month) pain, subacute (duration of 1-3 months) pain, or chronic (duration of >3 months) pain. Recommendations on use of opioids for acute pain and on tapering opioids for patients already receiving opioid therapy have been substantially expanded in this update. These recommendations do not apply to patients experiencing pain associated with the following conditions or settings: pain management related to sickle cell disease, cancer-related pain treatment, palliative care, and end-of-life care. Applicable outpatient settings include clinician offices, clinics, and urgent care centers. The recommendations do not apply to providing care to patients who are hospitalized or in an emergency department or other observational setting from which they might be admitted to inpatient care. These recommendations do apply to prescribing for pain management when patients are discharged from hospitals, emergency departments, or other facilities.</paragraph>
<paragraph>This clinical practice guideline addresses the following areas:</paragraph>
<paragraph>1. Determining whether or not to initiate opioids for pain 2. Selecting opioids and determining opioid dosages 3. Deciding duration of initial opioid prescription and conducting follow-up 4. Assessing risk and addressing potential harms of opioid use CDC developed this clinical practice guideline using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework, and recommendations are made based on a systematic review of the available scientific evidence while considering benefits and harms; values and preferences of patients, caregivers, and clinicians; and resource allocation (e.g., costs to patients or health systems, including clinician time). CDC obtained input on this clinical practice guideline through individual conversations with patients, caregivers, and clinicians and public comment opportunities available via Federal Register notices. CDC also sought input from the Board of Scientific Counselors of the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (BSC/NCIPC) (a federally chartered advisory committee), federal partners, and peer reviewers with scientific and clinical expertise.</paragraph>
<paragraph>The clinical evidence reviews found that a number of nonpharmacologic treatments and a number of nonopioid medications are associated with improvements in pain, function, or both, that appear comparable to improvements associated with opioid use. Multiple noninvasive nonpharmacologic interventions (e.g., exercise and psychological therapies) are associated with improvements in pain, function, or both, that are sustained after treatment and are not associated with serious harms. Nonopioid drugs, including serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) antidepressants, pregabalin and gabapentin, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), are associated with small to moderate improvements in chronic pain and function for certain chronic pain conditions. Nonopioid drug class-specific adverse events include serious cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, or renal effects with NSAIDs and sedation with anticonvulsants. Opioid therapy is associated with similar or decreased effectiveness for pain and function versus NSAIDs across several acute pain conditions and with small improvements in short-term (1 to <6 months) pain and function compared with placebo; evidence was found of attenuated pain reduction over time with opioids (between 3 and 6 months versus between 1 and 3 months). Opioid therapy is associated with increased risk for serious harms (including opioid use disorder and overdose) that appears to increase with increase in opioid dosage, without a clear threshold below which there is no risk. No validated, reliable way exists to predict which patients will suffer serious harm from opioid therapy. Evidence was sparse for longterm improvement of pain or function for any treatment for chronic pain. Some evidence indicated that beneficial effects of some nonpharmacologic therapies persist for up to 12 months after the end of a course of a treatment. Among 154 trials of nonopioid medications rated as good or fair quality, eight were long term (≥1 year). A single trial evaluated outcomes at 1 year for opioid medications (compared with nonopioid medications).</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>BOX 1. (Continued) Executive summary of the CDC Clinical Practice Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Pain -United States, 2022</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>CDC invited input on the draft clinical practice guideline and received approximately 5,500 public comments. Many of these comments were related to experiences with pain or with the aftermath of a family member's, friend's, or significant person's overdose; barriers to and access to pain care and evidence-based treatment; concerns about the level of specificity of recommendations; and overall communication and implementation of the clinical practice guideline. Some respondents expressed concerns that insufficient specificity of recommendations might leave clinicians without sufficient practical advice or context, whereas others were concerned that inclusion of more-specific recommendations or information in the guideline could facilitate misapplication through adaption of the clinical practice guideline or components of the guideline into rigid policies and laws. CDC incorporated insights from public comments into the clinical practice guideline, including special considerations for each recommendation. To help prevent misapplication of recommendations as inflexible rules and enable clinicians to account for individualized, person-centered clinical considerations, specific prescription dosages and durations are generally not included in the summary recommendation statements, which highlight general principles. Greater specificity is provided in implementation considerations and supporting rationales, which can offer more flexibility to help clinicians weigh benefits and risks of different therapeutic courses for specific patients.</paragraph>
<paragraph>Recommendation statements emphasize that opioids should be used only when benefits for pain and function are expected to outweigh risks. Before initiating opioid therapy for patients with pain, clinicians should discuss with patients the realistic benefits and known risks of opioid therapy. Before starting ongoing opioid therapy for patients with subacute or chronic pain, clinicians should work with patients to establish treatment goals for pain and function and consider how opioid therapy will be discontinued if benefits do not outweigh risks. When opioids are initiated, clinicians should prescribe the lowest effective dosage of immediate-release opioids for no longer than needed for the expected duration of pain severe enough to require opioids. During ongoing opioid therapy, clinicians should collaborate with patients to evaluate and carefully weigh benefits and risks of continuing opioid therapy and exercise care when increasing, continuing, or reducing opioid dosage. Before starting and periodically during continuation of opioid therapy, clinicians should evaluate risk for opioid-related harms and should work with patients to incorporate relevant strategies to mitigate risk, including offering naloxone and reviewing potential interactions with any other prescribed medications or substances used. Clinicians should offer or arrange treatment with evidence-based medications to treat patients with opioid use disorder.</paragraph>
<paragraph>CDC recommends that persons with pain receive appropriate pain treatment with careful consideration of the benefits and risks of all treatment options in the context of the patient's circumstances. Clinicians should collaborate with patients when making treatment decisions and designing a treatment plan, including when initiating or changing pain management strategies and particularly when considering initiating, increasing, tapering, or discontinuing opioids. Clinicians should avoid abrupt discontinuation of opioids, especially for patients receiving high dosages of opioids, should avoid dismissing patients from care, and should ensure (provide or arrange) appropriate care for patients with pain and patients with complications from opioid use (e.g., opioid use disorder). Quality and equitable care across sociodemographic groups requires attention to mitigation of potential barriers to care, such as through linguistically tailored care and cost-assistance programs to ensure access to appropriate pharmacotherapy, psychological support, and physical therapy as needed.</paragraph>
<paragraph>This voluntary clinical practice guideline provides recommendations only and is intended to support, not supplant, clinical judgment and individualized, personcentered decision-making. This clinical practice guideline should not be applied as inflexible standards of care across patient populations by health care professionals; health systems; pharmacies; third-party payers; or state, local, or federal organizations or entities. This clinical practice guideline is intended to improve communication between clinicians and patients about the benefits and risks of pain treatment, including opioid therapy for pain; improve the safety and effectiveness of pain treatment; mitigate pain; improve function and quality of life for patients with pain; and reduce risks associated with opioid pain therapy, including opioid use disorder, overdose, and death.

<sectionHeader>BOX 2. Intended use of CDC's Clinical Practice Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Pain -United States, 2022</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>This clinical practice guideline is • a clinical tool to improve communication between clinicians and patients and empower them to make informed, person-centered decisions related to pain care together; • intended for primary care clinicians and other clinicians providing pain care for outpatients aged ≥18 years with ï acute pain (duration of <1 month), ï subacute pain (duration of 1-3 months), or ï chronic pain (duration of >3 months); and • intended to be flexible to enable person-centered decision-making, taking into account a patient's expected health outcomes and well-being. This clinical practice guideline is not • a replacement for clinical judgment or individualized, person-centered care; • intended to be applied as inflexible standards of care across patients or patient populations by health care professionals, health systems, pharmacies, third-party payers, or governmental jurisdictions or to lead to the rapid tapering or abrupt discontinuation of opioids for patients; • a law, regulation, or policy that dictates clinical practice or as a substitute for Food and Drug Administration-approved labeling; • applicable to ï management of pain related to sickle cell disease, ï management of cancer-related pain, or ï palliative care or end-of-life care; or • focused on opioids prescribed for opioid use disorder. communication between clinicians and patients about the benefits and risks of prescription opioids and other pain treatment strategies; improve the safety and effectiveness of pain treatment; improve pain, function, and quality of life for persons with pain; and reduce the risks associated with opioid pain treatment (including opioid use disorder, overdose, and death) and with other pain treatment.</paragraph>
<paragraph>This clinical practice guideline provides voluntary clinical practice recommendations for clinicians that should not be used as inflexible standards of care. The recommendations are not intended to be implemented as absolute limits for policy or practice across populations by organizations, health care systems, or government entities.</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Scope and Audience</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>This clinical practice guideline is intended for clinicians who are treating outpatients aged ≥18 years with acute (duration of <1 month), subacute (duration of 1-3 months), or chronic (duration of >3 months) pain, and excludes pain management related to sickle cell disease, cancer-related pain treatment, palliative care, and end-of-life care. The recommendations are most relevant to clinicians whose scope of practice includes prescribing opioids (e.g., physicians, nurse practitioners and other advanced-practice registered nurses, physician assistants, and oral health practitioners). Because clinicians might work within team-based care, this clinical practice guideline also refers to and promotes integrated pain management and collaborative working relationships among clinicians (e.g., behavioral health specialists such as social workers or psychologists, pharmacists, and registered nurses). This guideline update includes recommendations for primary care clinicians (e.g., internists and family physicians) and other clinicians managing pain in outpatient settings (e.g., surgeons, emergency medicine clinicians, occupational medicine clinicians, physical medicine and rehabilitation clinicians, and neurologists). Applicable settings include clinician offices, clinics, and urgent care centers. The recommendations do not apply to care provided to patients who are hospitalized or in an emergency department or other observational setting from which they might be admitted to inpatient care. These recommendations do apply to prescribing for pain management for patients when they are discharged from hospitals, emergency departments, or other facilities.</paragraph>
<paragraph>In addition to updating recommendations on the basis of new evidence regarding management of chronic pain, this clinical practice guideline is intended to assist clinicians in weighing benefits and risks of prescribing opioid pain medication for painful acute conditions (e.g., low back pain, neck pain, other musculoskeletal pain, neuropathic pain, dental pain, kidney stone pain, and acute episodic migraine) and pain related to procedures (e.g., postoperative pain and pain from oral surgery). In 2020, several of these indications were prioritized by an ad hoc committee of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine</paragraph>
<paragraph>The 2016 CDC Opioid Prescribing Guideline focused on recommendations for primary care physicians. This clinical practice guideline expands the scope to additional clinicians. Although primary care physicians prescribe approximately 37% of all opioid prescriptions, other clinicians, including pain medicine clinicians (8.9%) and dentists (8.6%), account for considerable proportions of prescriptions. Pain medicine and physical medicine and rehabilitation clinicians prescribe opioids at the highest rates, followed by orthopedic and family medicine clinicians</paragraph>
<paragraph>Many principles of pain management are similar whether or not the treating clinician is a pain management specialist, and many of the recommendations might be relevant for pain management specialists. Many pain management specialists already follow principles outlined in this clinical practice guideline; however, use by pain management specialists is not the focus of this clinical practice guideline. Pain management specialists often have extensive training and expertise in pain management modalities that other clinicians do not, and they might treat patients with clinical situations that are more complex, less prevalent, and not well addressed by the available evidence; therefore, the balance of benefits and risks to patients might differ when the treating clinician is a pain management specialist.</paragraph>
<paragraph>The recommendations address the use of opioid pain medication in certain special populations (e.g., older adults and pregnant persons) and in populations with conditions posing special risks (e.g., a history of a substance use disorder). The recommendations do not address the use of opioid pain medication in children or adolescents aged <18 years. The available evidence concerning the benefits and risks of longterm opioid therapy in children and adolescents remains limited, and few opioid medications provide information in their labeling regarding safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients. Guidelines and recommendations are available for pain management in children with sickle cell disease</paragraph>
<paragraph>Although some principles in this clinical practice guideline might be helpful in the management of pain related to sickle cell disease, cancer-related pain treatment, palliative care, and end-of-life care, some recommendations might not be relevant for pain management in these contexts. Other guidelines more specifically address pain management in these situations</paragraph>
<paragraph>This clinical practice guideline follows the Institute of Medicine's definition of palliative care as care that provides relief from pain and other symptoms, supports quality of life, and is focused on patients with serious advanced illness</paragraph>
<paragraph>Recommendations on pain management for patients with cancer and patients who have survived cancer are available in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology: Adult Cancer Pain</paragraph>
<paragraph>Although this update includes content on pain management for patients with opioid use disorder and one recommendation on management of opioid use disorder as a complication of opioid use, recommendations on opioids used specifically as medications for opioid use disorder are not the focus of this clinical practice guideline. More detailed recommendations on management of patients with opioid use disorder are available in the American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) National Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder: 2020 Focused Update</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Clinical Practice Guideline Development Methods</sectionHeader>

<sectionHeader>Systematic Reviews and Evidence Sources</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>The 2016 CDC Opioid Prescribing Guideline was based on a systematic clinical evidence review sponsored by AHRQ on the effectiveness and risks of long-term opioid therapy for chronic pain</paragraph>
<paragraph>For this update to the 2016 CDC Opioid Prescribing Guideline, CDC funded AHRQ in 2018 and 2019 to conduct five systematic reviews</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>AHRQ Method for Evaluating</sectionHeader>

<sectionHeader>Quality of Evidence</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>The reviews used the AHRQ approach to synthesize and grade the strength of evidence</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>ACIP Adapted GRADE Method for Evaluating Quality of Evidence</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>The GRADE method is predicated on a systematic review of scientific evidence and provides a transparent framework for grading the quality of evidence and strength of recommendations. GRADE has been adapted by ACIP</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Categorizing the Evidence</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>The AHRQ approach uses a different method and terminology (high, moderate, low, or insufficient) to grade the strength of evidence from the ACIP adapted GRADE method (evidence types 1, 2, 3, or 4)</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Recommendation Development</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>CDC developed this clinical practice guideline using the method developed by the GRADE working group (</paragraph>
<paragraph>In accordance with the ACIP adapted GRADE method, CDC drafted evidence-based recommendations focused on determining whether or not to initiate opioids for pain, selecting opioids and determining opioid dosages, deciding duration of initial opioid prescription and conducting</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Federal Advisory Committee Review and Recommendation</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>CDC sought recommendations on the draft clinical practice guideline from one of its federal advisory committees, the Board of Scientific Counselors of the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (BSC/NCIPC). BSC/NCIPC advises the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary, the CDC Director, and the NCIPC Director and makes recommendations regarding scientific, programmatic, and research policies, strategies, objectives, projects, and priorities. BSC/NCIPC also reviews progress toward injury and violence prevention. BSC/NCIPC members are special government employees appointed by the HHS Secretary or their designee as CDC advisory committee members. Members are required to complete the Office of Government Ethics Form 450 annually to disclose relevant interests and report on their disclosures during meetings. Disclosures for BSC/NCIPC are reported in this clinical practice guideline. Meeting minutes and documents for public BSC/NCIPC meetings are available US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on the BSC/NCIPC website (</paragraph>
<paragraph>On December 4-5, 2019, CDC held a public meeting of BSC/NCIPC (announced via Federal Register 84 FR 57021; 84 FR 65159) and provided a presentation on the background for updating the clinical practice guideline. CDC then requested the formation of an Opioid Workgroup (OWG), under the parent BSC, whose primary purpose would be to review a draft clinical practice guideline and to develop a report of their observations for BSC/NCIPC</paragraph>
<paragraph>To provide background to BSC/NCIPC for informing the creation of OWG with a balance of perspectives, CDC identified audiences that would be 1) directly affected by the clinical practice guideline, 2) directly involved with implementing or integrating recommendations into current practice, and 3) qualified to represent a specific discipline or expertise in alignment with the tasks of the workgroup for consideration by BSC/NCIPC. Identified groups with perspectives that would support the workgroup's capacity included, but were not limited to, patients with pain, family members and caregivers, clinicians, public health practitioners, and research scientists. CDC announced the call for nominations at the December 4-5, 2019, public meeting and heard recommendations from the public during the public comment opportunities, as well as from BSC/NCIPC members, regarding recommendations for nominations. Persons interested in being considered for the workgroup were encouraged to submit self-nominations from December 4, 2019, through February 4, 2020. CDC's BSC/NCIPC received 255 nominations for OWG.</paragraph>
<paragraph>After reviewing clinical expertise, professional credentials, and diversity in perspectives of all nominees (including diversity of gender, race and ethnicity, geographic region, institutional affiliations, and personal experiences relevant to pain management and providing care to patients with pain), OWG's Designated Federal Officer (DFO) created a list of prospective workgroup members and sent them invitations to participate, along with conflict of interest disclosure forms. OWG's DFO and BSC/NCIPC's DFO reviewed conflict of interest disclosure forms. CDC's Strategic Business Initiatives Unit (SBIU), which oversees the Federal Advisory Committee Act program, also reviewed the OWG Terms of Reference, prospective OWG roster, curricula vitae, and conflict of interest disclosure forms and determined all reported financial or other conflicts of interest were not present or nonsignificant before finalizing selection.* OWG members disclosed any potential topical conflicts of interest related to OWG meeting agenda items before each meeting. Disclosures of OWG are reported in the clinical practice guideline.</paragraph>
<paragraph>OWG had 23 members (108) including four ex officio members representing federal partner agencies (see Federal Partner Engagement). In accordance with CDC guidance</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Federal Partner Engagement</sectionHeader>

<sectionHeader>Public Comment and Community Engagement</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>CDC sought input through Federal Register notices to better understand community members' experiences and perspectives related to pain and pain management options before drafting the clinical practice guideline</paragraph>
<paragraph>In addition, the Lab at the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) (</paragraph>
<paragraph>CDC</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Peer Review</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>This clinical practice guideline provides influential scientific information that could have a clear and substantial effect on public-and private-sector decisions. Therefore, peer review of the draft clinical practice guideline was required per the final information quality bulletin for peer review (</paragraph>
<paragraph>CDC identified peer reviewers on the basis of multiple factors, including scientific and subject matter expertise, racial and ethnic diversity, gender diversity, diversity of experiences and perspectives, independence from the clinical practice guideline development process, and consideration of conflicts of interest. Specific effort was made to identify subject matter experts with knowledge and experience in topics such as chronic and acute pain management, clinical practice, health equity, mental health and well-being, opioids and opioid therapies, opioid tapering, opioid use disorder treatment, pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic pain management, and surgical pain management. CDC assessed potential conflicts of interest before finalizing selection of peer reviewers. The NCIPC Associate Director for Science reviewed conflict of interest disclosure forms and determined no conflicts of interest were present. After the peer reviews were completed, CDC posted the names of peer reviewers on the NCIPC and CDC/ATSDR Peer Review Agenda websites, which provide information about the peer review of influential government scientific documents</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Recommendations</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>This clinical practice guideline includes 12 recommendations for clinicians who are prescribing opioids for outpatients aged ≥18 years with acute (duration of <1 month), subacute (duration of 1-3 months), or chronic (duration of >3 months) pain, excluding pain management related to sickle cell disease, cancer-related pain treatment, palliative care, and end-oflife care (Box 3). The recommendations are not intended to be implemented as absolute limits of policy or practice across populations by organizations, health care systems, or government entities. In accordance with the ACIP adapted GRADE method, CDC based the recommendations on consideration of clinical evidence, contextual evidence (e.g., benefits and harms, values and preferences, and resource allocation), and expert opinion. Expert input is reflected within the recommendation rationales. For each recommendation statement, CDC notes the recommendation category (A or B) and the type of evidence (1, 2, 3, or 4) supporting the statement (Box 3).</paragraph>
<paragraph>Category A recommendations indicate that most patients should receive the recommended course of action; category B recommendations indicate that different choices will be appropriate for different patients, requiring clinicians to help patients arrive at a decision consistent with patient values and preferences and specific clinical situations. Consistent with the ACIP</paragraph>
<paragraph>In summary, the categorization of recommendations was based on the following assessment:</paragraph>
<paragraph>• A number of nonpharmacologic treatments and nonopioid medications are associated with improvements in pain, function, or both that are reportedly comparable to improvements associated with opioid use</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Determining Whether or Not to Initiate Opioids for Pain</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>All patients with pain should receive treatment that provides the greatest benefits relative to risks. (See Recommendation 1 for determining whether or not to initiate opioids for acute pain [i.e., pain lasting <1 month] and Recommendation 2 for determining whether or not to initiate opioids for subacute pain [i.e., pain lasting 1-3 months] or chronic pain [i.e., pain lasting >3 months].)</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Recommendation 1</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>Nonopioid therapies are at least as effective as opioids for many common types of acute pain. Clinicians should maximize use of nonpharmacologic and nonopioid pharmacologic therapies as appropriate for the specific condition and patient and only consider opioid therapy for acute pain if benefits are anticipated to outweigh risks to the patient. Before prescribing opioid therapy for acute pain, clinicians should discuss with patients the realistic benefits and known risks of opioid therapy (recommendation category: B; evidence type: 3).</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Implementation Considerations</sectionHeader>

<sectionHeader>Supporting Rationale</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>Evaluation of the patient is critical to appropriate management. Evaluation can identify reversible causes of pain and underlying etiologies with potentially serious sequelae that require urgent action. To guide patient-specific selection of therapy, clinicians should evaluate patients and establish or confirm the diagnosis. Diagnosis can help identify interventions to reverse, ameliorate, or prevent worsening of pain and improve function (e.g., surgical intervention to repair structure and function after certain traumatic injuries, bracing to prevent recurrence of acute ankle sprain, fracture immobilization, ice or elevation to reduce swelling, and early mobilization to maintain function)</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Noninvasive Nonpharmacologic Approaches to Acute Pain</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>Noninvasive nonpharmacologic approaches to acute pain have the potential to improve pain and function without risk for serious harms</paragraph>
<paragraph>The American College of Physicians (ACP) recommends nonpharmacologic treatment with superficial heat, massage, acupuncture, or spinal manipulation as a cornerstone of treatment for acute low back pain</paragraph>
<paragraph>Despite evidence supporting their use, noninvasive nonpharmacologic therapies are not always or fully covered by insurance</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Nonopioid Medications for Acute Pain</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>Many acute pain conditions often can be managed most effectively with nonopioid medications</paragraph>
<paragraph>ACP recommends NSAIDs or skeletal muscle relaxants if pharmacologic treatment is desired to treat low back pain</paragraph>
<paragraph>When not contraindicated, NSAIDs should be used for low back pain, painful musculoskeletal injuries (including minor pain related to fractures), dental pain, postoperative pain, and kidney stone pain; triptans, NSAIDs, or their combinations should be used along with antiemetics as needed for acute pain related to episodic migraine. NSAID use has been associated with serious gastrointestinal events and major coronary events</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Pain Management for Pregnant and Postpartum Persons</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>For pain management in the postpartum period, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends stepwise, multimodal, shared decisionmaking, incorporating pharmacologic treatments that might include opioids. After vaginal delivery, ACOG recommends acetaminophen or NSAIDs, and if needed, adding an opioid. After cesarean delivery, ACOG recommends standard oral and parenteral medications such as acetaminophen, NSAIDs, or lowdose, low-potency, short-acting opioids with duration of opioid use limited to the shortest reasonable course expected for treating acute pain</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Opioid Medication for Acute Pain</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>A systematic review found that for musculoskeletal injuries such as sprains, whiplash, and muscle strains, no opioid provided better benefit than NSAIDs, and opioid use caused the most harms</paragraph>
<paragraph>For acute low back pain, ACP found insufficient evidence for effectiveness of opioids and recommends nonopioid medications (see Nonopioid Medications for Acute Pain) if choosing pharmacologic treatment</paragraph>
<paragraph>Because of equivalent or lesser effectiveness for pain relief compared with NSAIDs and risks for long-term opioid use after using opioids for acute pain, opioids are not recommended as first-line therapy for many common acute pain conditions, including low back pain, neck pain, pain related to other musculoskeletal injuries (e.g., sprains, strains, tendonitis, and bursitis), pain related to minor surgeries typically associated with minimal tissue injury and only mild postoperative pain (e.g., simple dental extraction), dental pain, kidney stone pain, and headaches including episodic migraine. Opioid therapy has an important role for acute pain related to severe traumatic injuries (including crush injuries and burns), invasive surgeries typically associated with moderate to severe postoperative pain, and other severe acute pain when NSAIDs and other therapies are contraindicated or likely to be ineffective.</paragraph>
<paragraph>When diagnosis and severity of acute pain warrant the use of opioids, clinicians should prescribe immediate-release opioids (see Recommendation 3) at the lowest effective dose (see Recommendation 4) and for no longer than the expected duration of pain severe enough to require opioids (see Recommendation 6) to minimize unintentional initiation of long-term opioid use. Clinicians should maximize use of nonopioid pharmacologic (e.g., NSAIDs, acetaminophen, or both) and nonpharmacologic (e.g., ice, heat, elevation, rest, immobilization, or exercise) therapies as appropriate for the specific condition and continue these therapies as needed after opioids are discontinued. Clinicians should work with patients to prevent prolonged opioid use, prescribe and advise opioid use only as needed (e.g., hydrocodone 5 mg/acetaminophen 325 mg, one tablet not more frequently than every 4 hours as needed for moderate to severe pain) rather than on a scheduled basis (e.g., one tablet every 4 hours), and encourage and include an opioid taper if opioids will be taken around the clock for more than a few days (see</paragraph>
<paragraph>Although findings regarding risks for new long-term opioid use after use for acute pain</paragraph>
<paragraph>Patient education and discussion before starting outpatient opioid therapy are critical so that patient preferences and values can be understood and used to inform clinical decisions. Clinicians should ensure that patients are aware of expected benefits of, common risks of, serious risks of, and alternatives to opioids before starting or continuing opioid therapy and should involve patients in decisions about whether to start opioid therapy. Essential elements for communication and discussion with patients before prescribing outpatient opioid therapy for acute pain include the following:</paragraph>
<paragraph>• Advise patients that short-term opioid use can lead to unintended long-term opioid use and of the importance of working toward planned discontinuation of opioid use as soon as feasible, including a plan to appropriately taper opioids as pain resolves if opioids have been used around the clock for more than a few days (see</paragraph>
<paragraph>• Review communication mechanisms and protocols patients can use to tell clinicians of severe or uncontrolled pain and to arrange for timely reassessment and management. • Advise patients about serious adverse effects of opioids, including potentially fatal respiratory depression and development of a potentially serious opioid use disorder (see Recommendation 12) that can cause distress and inability to fulfill major role obligations at work, school, or home. • Advise patients about common effects of opioids, such as constipation, dry mouth, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, confusion, tolerance, physical dependence, and withdrawal symptoms when stopping opioids. To prevent constipation associated with opioid use, advise patients to increase hydration and fiber intake and to maintain or increase physical activity as they are able. Prophylactic pharmacologic therapy (e.g., a stimulant laxative such as senna, with or without a stool softener) might be needed to ensure regular bowel movements if opioids are used for more than a few days. Stool softeners or fiber laxatives without another laxative should be avoided. To minimize withdrawal symptoms, clinicians should provide and discuss an opioid tapering plan when opioids will be used around the clock for more than a few days (see</paragraph>
<paragraph>Limiting opioid use to the minimum needed to manage pain (e.g., taking the opioid only when needed if needed less frequently than every 4 hours and the prescription is written for every 4 hours as needed for pain) can help limit development of tolerance and therefore withdrawal after opioids are discontinued. • If formulations are prescribed that combine opioids with acetaminophen, advise patients of the risks of taking additional over-the-counter products containing acetaminophen. • To help patients assess when a dose of opioids is needed, explain that the goal is to reduce pain to make it manageable rather than to eliminate pain. • Discuss effects that opioids might have on a person's ability to safely operate a vehicle or other machinery, particularly when opioids are initiated or when other central nervous system depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines or alcohol) are used concurrently. • Discuss the potential for workplace toxicology testing programs to detect therapeutic opioid use. • Discuss increased risks for opioid use disorder, respiratory depression, and death at higher dosages, along with the importance of taking only the amount of opioids prescribed (i.e., not taking more opioids than prescribed or taking them more often).</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Recommendation 2</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>Nonopioid therapies are preferred for subacute and chronic pain. Clinicians should maximize use of nonpharmacologic and nonopioid pharmacologic therapies as appropriate for the specific condition and patient and only consider initiating opioid therapy if expected benefits for pain and function are anticipated to outweigh risks to the patient.</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Before starting opioid therapy for subacute or chronic pain, clinicians should discuss with patients the realistic benefits and known risks of opioid therapy, should work with patients to establish treatment goals for pain and function, and should consider how opioid therapy will be discontinued if benefits do not outweigh risks (recommendation category: A; evidence type: 2).</sectionHeader>

<sectionHeader>Implementation Considerations</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>• To guide patient-specific selection of therapy, clinicians should evaluate patients and establish or confirm the diagnosis. • Clinicians should recommend appropriate noninvasive nonpharmacologic approaches to help manage chronic pain, such as exercise (e.g., aerobic, aquatic, or resistance exercises) or exercise therapy (a prominent modality in physical therapy) for back pain, fibromyalgia, and hip or knee osteoarthritis; weight loss for knee osteoarthritis; manual therapies for hip osteoarthritis; psychological therapy, spinal manipulation, low-level laser therapy, massage, mindfulness-based stress reduction, yoga, acupuncture, and multidisciplinary rehabilitation for low back pain; mind-body practices (e.g., yoga, tai chi, or qigong), massage, and acupuncture for neck pain; cognitive behavioral therapy, myofascial release massage, mindfulness practices, tai chi, qigong, acupuncture, and multidisciplinary rehabilitation for fibromyalgia; and spinal manipulation for tension headache.</paragraph>
<paragraph>• Low-cost options to integrate exercise include walking in public spaces or use of public recreation facilities for group exercise. Physical therapy can be helpful, particularly for patients who have limited access to safe public spaces or public recreation facilities for exercise or whose pain has not improved with low-intensity physical exercise. • Health insurers and health systems can improve pain management and reduce medication use and associated risks by increasing reimbursement for and access to noninvasive nonpharmacologic therapies with evidence for effectiveness. • Clinicians should review FDA-approved labeling, including boxed warnings, and weigh benefits and risks before initiating treatment with any pharmacologic therapy. • When patients affected by osteoarthritis have an insufficient response to nonpharmacologic interventions such as exercise for arthritis pain, topical NSAIDs can be used in patients with pain in a single or few joints near the surface of the skin (e.g., knee). For patients with osteoarthritis pain in multiple joints or incompletely controlled with topical NSAIDs, duloxetine or systemic NSAIDs can be considered. • NSAIDs should be used at the lowest effective dose and shortest duration needed and should be used with caution, particularly in older adults and in patients with cardiovascular comorbidities, chronic renal failure, or previous gastrointestinal bleeding. • When patients with chronic low back pain have had an insufficient response to nonpharmacologic approaches such as exercise, clinicians can consider NSAIDs or duloxetine for patients without contraindications. • Tricyclic, tetracyclic, and SNRI antidepressants; selected anticonvulsants (e.g., pregabalin, gabapentin enacarbil, oxcarbazepine); and capsaicin and lidocaine patches can be considered for neuropathic pain. In older adults, decisions to use tricyclic antidepressants should be made judiciously on a case-by-case basis because of risks for confusion and falls. • Duloxetine and pregabalin are FDA-approved for the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy, and pregabalin and gabapentin are FDA-approved for treatment of postherpetic neuralgia. • In patients with fibromyalgia, tricyclic (e.g., amitriptyline) and SNRI antidepressants (e.g., duloxetine, milnacipran), NSAIDs (e.g., topical diclofenac), and specific anticonvulsants (i.e., pregabalin and gabapentin) are used to improve pain, function, and quality of life. Duloxetine, milnacipran, and pregabalin are FDA-approved for the treatment of fibromyalgia. In older adults, decisions to use tricyclic antidepressants should be made judiciously on a case-by-case basis because of risks for confusion and falls. • Patients with co-occurring pain and depression might be especially likely to benefit from antidepressant medication (see Recommendation 8). • Opioids should not be considered first-line or routine therapy for subacute or chronic pain. This does not mean that patients should be required to sequentially fail nonpharmacologic and nonopioid pharmacologic therapy or be required to use any specific treatment before proceeding to opioid therapy. Rather, expected benefits specific to the clinical context should be weighed against risks before initiating therapy. In some clinical contexts (e.g., serious illness in a patient with poor prognosis for return to previous level of function, contraindications to other therapies, and clinician and patient agreement that the overriding goal is patient comfort), opioids might be appropriate regardless of previous therapies used. In other situations (e.g., headache or fibromyalgia), expected benefits of initiating opioids are unlikely to outweigh risks regardless of previous nonpharmacologic and nonopioid pharmacologic therapies used. • Opioid therapy should not be initiated without consideration by the clinician and patient of an exit strategy to be used if opioid therapy is unsuccessful. • Before opioid therapy is initiated for subacute or chronic pain, clinicians should determine jointly with patients how functional benefit will be evaluated and establish specific, measurable treatment goals. • For patients with subacute pain who started opioid therapy for acute pain and have been treated with opioid therapy for ≥30 days, clinicians should ensure that potentially reversible causes of chronic pain are addressed and that opioid prescribing for acute pain does not unintentionally become long-term opioid therapy simply because medications are continued without reassessment. Continuation of opioid therapy at this point might represent initiation of long-term opioid therapy, which should occur only as an intentional decision that benefits are likely to outweigh risks after informed discussion between the clinician and patient and as part of a comprehensive pain management approach. • Clinicians should review available low-cost options for pain management for all patients and particularly for patients who have low incomes, do not have health insurance, or have inadequate insurance. • Clinicians should ensure that patients are aware of expected benefits of, common risks of, serious risks of, and alternatives to opioids before starting or continuing opioid therapy and should involve patients in decisions about whether to start opioid therapy.</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Supporting Rationale</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>To guide patient-specific selection of therapy, clinicians should evaluate patients and establish or confirm the diagnosis</paragraph>
<paragraph>Diagnosis can help identify disease-specific interventions to reverse, ameliorate, or prevent worsening of pain and improve function (e.g., improving glucose control to prevent progression of diabetic neuropathy; immune-modulating agents for rheumatoid arthritis; physical or occupational therapy to address posture, muscle weakness, or repetitive occupational motions that contribute to musculoskeletal pain; or surgical intervention to relieve severe mechanical or compressive pain)</paragraph>
<paragraph>Review of the patient's history and context beyond the presenting pain syndrome is helpful in selection of pain treatments. In particular, medications should be used only after assessment and determination that expected benefits outweigh risks, considering patient-specific factors. For example, clinicians should consider fall risk when selecting and dosing potentially sedating medications (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and opioids) and should weigh benefits and risks of use, dosage, and duration of NSAIDs when treating older adults and patients with hypertension, renal insufficiency, heart failure, or those with risk for peptic ulcer disease or cardiovascular disease. NSAIDs are potentially inappropriate for use in older adults with chronic pain because of higher risk for adverse effects with prolonged use</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Noninvasive Nonpharmacologic Approaches to Subacute and Chronic Pain</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>Many noninvasive nonpharmacologic approaches, including physical therapy, weight loss for knee osteoarthritis, and behavioral therapies (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness-based stress reduction), can improve pain and function without risk for serious harms</paragraph>
<paragraph>Despite their favorable benefit-to-risk profile, noninvasive nonpharmacologic therapies are not always covered or fully covered by insurance</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Nonopioid Medications for Subacute and Chronic Pain</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>Several nonopioid pharmacologic therapies (including acetaminophen, NSAIDs, and selected antidepressants and anticonvulsants) are used for painful symptoms in chronic pain conditions. Nonopioid pharmacologic therapies are associated with risks, particularly in older adults, pregnant patients, and patients with certain comorbidities such as cardiovascular, renal, gastrointestinal, and liver disease. For example, NSAID use has been associated with serious gastrointestinal events and major coronary events</paragraph>
<paragraph>For osteoarthritis, NSAIDs including topical NSAIDs and SNRI antidepressant duloxetine have small to moderate benefits for pain and function at short-term assessment (3-6 months), with intermediate-term (6-12 months) evidence for certain medications (celecoxib and duloxetine) and evidence that duloxetine is more effective in older (>65 years) than younger patients and in patients with knee osteoarthritis</paragraph>
<paragraph>Oral NSAIDs should be used with caution, particularly in older persons and in patients with cardiovascular comorbidities, chronic renal failure, or previous gastrointestinal bleeding. In patients with gastrointestinal comorbidities but without current or previous gastrointestinal bleeding, cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors or NSAIDs with proton pump inhibitors can be used to minimize risk compared with risk with use of NSAIDs alone</paragraph>
<paragraph>Moderate-quality evidence demonstrates small improvements in chronic low back pain with NSAIDs (119) and with duloxetine</paragraph>
<paragraph>For temporomandibular disorder pain that is not sufficiently improved with nonpharmacologic interventions, NSAIDs can be effective</paragraph>
<paragraph>In patients with fibromyalgia, multiple medications are associated with small to moderate improvements in pain, function, and quality of life, including SNRI antidepressants (duloxetine and milnacipran), NSAIDs (topical diclofenac), and specific anticonvulsants (pregabalin and gabapentin)</paragraph>
<paragraph>Tricyclic antidepressants are potentially inappropriate for older adults (aged ≥65 years) because of their anticholinergic effects</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Opioid Medication for Subacute and Chronic Pain</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>Clinical evidence reviews found insufficient evidence to determine long-term benefits of opioid therapy for chronic pain and found an increased risk for serious harms related to long-term opioid therapy that appears to be dose dependent</paragraph>
<paragraph>Clinical evidence reviews identified an observational study (54) finding long-term (>90 days' supply) opioid prescription to be associated with considerably increased risk for a new opioid use disorder diagnosis for all dosages of long-term (>90 days' supply) opioids prescribed compared with no opioids prescribed, with adjusted odds ratios of 15, 29, and 122 at low (1-36 MME/day), medium (36-120 MME/day), and high (≥120 MME/day) opioid dosages, respectively. Compared with no opioid use, opioid use was associated with increased risk for opioid use disorder, overdose, all-cause deaths, fractures, falls, and myocardial infarction</paragraph>
<paragraph>Multiple experts from OWG stated that they appreciated this recommendation because of the importance of highlighting both pain and function, sharing realistic expectations with patients before initiating treatment, and paying attention to tapering and exit strategies. Although some experts reasoned the recommendation statement could state nonopioid therapies "may be preferred" or "may be effective" for chronic pain, others agreed with language that nonopioid therapies "are preferred" for chronic pain because opioid therapies are associated with small short-term benefits compared with placebo, comparable or reduced short-term benefits compared with nonopioid therapies, uncertain long-term benefits, and potential for serious harms.</paragraph>
<paragraph>Opioids should not be considered first-line or routine therapy for subacute or chronic pain. Although evidence on long-term benefits of nonopioid therapies also is limited, these therapies also are associated with short-term benefits, no evidence exists for attenuated benefit over time or difficulty stopping therapy when benefits do not outweigh risks, and risks for serious harms are usually lower. This does not mean that patients should be required to sequentially fail nonpharmacologic and nonopioid pharmacologic therapy or be required to use any specific treatment before proceeding to opioid therapy. Rather, expected benefits specific to the clinical context should be weighed against risks before initiating therapy. In some clinical contexts (e.g., serious illness in a patient with poor prognosis for return to previous level of function, contraindications to other therapies, and clinician and patient agreement that the overriding goal is patient comfort), opioids might be appropriate regardless of previous therapies used. In other situations (e.g., headache or fibromyalgia), expected benefits of initiating opioids are unlikely to outweigh risks regardless of previous nonpharmacologic and nonopioid pharmacologic therapies used.</paragraph>
<paragraph>Clinical evidence reviews found no instrument with high accuracy for predicting opioid-related harms, such as overdose or opioid use disorder</paragraph>
<paragraph>Before opioid therapy is initiated for subacute or chronic pain, clinicians should determine with patients how functional benefit will be evaluated and establish treatment goals. Some patients have reported treatment goals are effective in increasing motivation and functioning</paragraph>
<paragraph>Patients with subacute pain might be at a particularly critical point, both for potential transition to chronic pain and potential transition to long-term opioid therapy. Clinicians should reevaluate patients with subacute pain and their treatment course, ensure that potentially reversible causes of ongoing pain are addressed, and optimize pain management as needed. For patients with subacute pain who started opioid therapy for acute pain and have been treated with opioid therapy for ≥30 days, clinicians should ensure that opioid prescribing for acute pain does not unintentionally become long-term opioid prescribing simply because medications are continued without reassessment. Continuation of opioid therapy at this point might represent initiation of long-term opioid therapy, which should occur only as an intentional decision that benefits are likely to outweigh risks after informed discussion between the clinician and patient and as part of a comprehensive pain management approach.</paragraph>
<paragraph>Clinicians seeing new patients already using opioid medication should establish treatment goals, including functional goals, for continued opioid therapy. Clinicians should avoid rapid tapering or abrupt discontinuation of opioids (see</paragraph>
<paragraph>Patient education and discussion before starting opioid therapy are critical so that patient preferences and values can be understood and used to inform clinical decisions. Clinicians US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention should ensure that patients are aware of expected benefits of, common risks of, serious risks of, and alternatives to opioids before starting or continuing opioid therapy and should involve patients in decisions about whether to start opioid therapy. Many patients rank pain relief, nausea, vomiting, and constipation as important effects</paragraph>
<paragraph>• Review available low-cost options for pain management for all patients, and particularly for patients who have low incomes, do not have health insurance, or have inadequate insurance. Review considerations related to access to care because of the clinical oversight needed to initiate and continue opioid therapy and other treatments for pain. • Be explicit and realistic about expected benefits of opioids, explaining that there is not robust evidence that opioids improve pain or function with long-term use and that complete elimination of pain is unlikely. • Emphasize improvement in function as a primary goal and that function can improve even when pain is not eliminated. Discuss the importance of reassessing medication use over time with both the patient and caregiver, as appropriate. Because of the possibility that benefits of opioid therapy might diminish or that risks might become more prominent over time, clinicians should elicit patients' experiences and preferences and review expected benefits and risks of continued opioid therapy with patients periodically (see</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Interventional Approaches to Subacute and Chronic Pain</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>Office-based interventional approaches, such as arthrocentesis and intra-articular glucocorticoid injection for pain associated with rheumatoid arthritis</paragraph>
<paragraph>Interventional pain management specialists offer additional interventions that can alleviate pain as part of a comprehensive pain management approach (6) for patients with indications including back pain, persistent pain after spinal surgery, neuropathic pain, and complex regional pain syndrome. Certain more common procedures include epidural steroid injections (for lumbar radiculopathy with herniated disc), nerve ablation procedures (e.g., radiofrequency denervation for low back pain), and neurostimulation procedures (e.g., peripheral nerve stimulation and spinal cord stimulation). Descriptions of common interventional procedures are available</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Multimodal Therapy for Subacute and Chronic Pain</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>Integrated pain management requires coordination of medical, psychological, and social aspects of health care and includes primary care, mental and behavioral health care, and specialist services when needed</paragraph>
<paragraph>Depending on patient comorbidities and benefit-to-risk ratios in individual patients, combinations of medications (e.g., two nonopioid medications with different mechanisms of action or a nonopioid with an opioid medication) also might be used. In some cases, medication combinations might provide complementary or synergistic benefits and facilitate lower dosing of individual medications, as has been demonstrated in trials of patients with neuropathic pain</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Selecting Opioids and Determining Opioid Dosages Recommendation 3</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>When starting opioid therapy for acute, subacute, or chronic pain, clinicians should prescribe immediate-release opioids instead of extended-release and long-acting (ER/LA) opioids (recommendation category: A; evidence type: 4).</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Implementation Considerations</sectionHeader>

<sectionHeader>Supporting Rationale</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>ER/LA opioids include methadone, transdermal fentanyl, and extended-release versions of opioids such as oxycodone, hydromorphone, hydrocodone, and morphine. Clinical evidence reviews found that effects of opioids on short-term pain and function were generally consistent across duration of action (short-or long-acting) and opioid type (opioid agonist, partial agonist, or mixed mechanism [with mixed opioid and nonopioid mechanisms of action] agent), although five trials directly comparing different types of opioids found a mixed mechanism agent associated with greater pain relief versus a pure opioid agonist, with fewer nonserious adverse events</paragraph>
<paragraph>A fair-quality study demonstrated a higher risk for overdose among patients treated with ER/LA opioids than among those treated with immediate-release opioids, especially within the first 2 weeks of therapy, with relative risk decreasing with longer duration of exposure</paragraph>
<paragraph>In 2014, FDA modified the labeling for ER/LA opioid pain medications, noting serious risks and recommending that ER/LA opioids be reserved for management of pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment when alternative treatment options (e.g., nonopioid analgesics or immediate-release opioids) are ineffective, not tolerated, or would be otherwise inadequate to provide sufficient management of pain and not used as as-needed pain relievers</paragraph>
<paragraph>In comparing different ER/LA formulations, clinical evidence reviews found inconsistent results for overdose risk with methadone versus other ER/LA opioids used for chronic pain, with two cohort studies of Medicaid beneficiaries finding methadone associated with increased risk for overdose or allcause deaths versus morphine and one cohort study of U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs patients finding methadone to be associated with decreased risk</paragraph>
<paragraph>Clinicians should not treat acute pain with ER/LA opioids or initiate opioid treatment for subacute or chronic pain with ER/LA opioids, and clinicians should not prescribe ER/LA opioids for intermittent use. Because of the longer half-life and longer duration of effects (e.g., respiratory depression) of ER/LA opioids (e.g., methadone, fentanyl patches, or extended-release versions of oxycodone, hydromorphone, hydrocodone, or morphine), clinicians should not prescribe ER/LA opioids for the treatment of acute pain. ER/LA opioids should be reserved for severe, continuous pain and should be considered only for patients who have received certain dosages of immediate-release opioids daily (e.g., 60 mg daily of oral morphine, 30 mg daily of oral oxycodone, or equianalgesic dosages of other opioids) for at least 1 week</paragraph>
<paragraph>When an ER/LA opioid is prescribed, using one with predictable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics is preferred to minimize unintentional overdose risk. In particular, unique characteristics of methadone and transdermal fentanyl make safe prescribing of these medications for pain especially challenging. Methadone should not be the first choice for an ER/LA opioid. Only clinicians who are familiar with methadone's unique risk profile and who are prepared to educate and closely monitor their patients, including risk assessment for QT prolongation and consideration of electrocardiographic monitoring, should consider prescribing methadone for pain. A clinical practice guideline regarding methadone prescribing for pain has been published previously</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Recommendation 4</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>When opioids are initiated for opioid-naïve patients with acute, subacute, or chronic pain, clinicians should prescribe the lowest effective dosage. If opioids are continued for subacute or chronic pain, clinicians should use caution when prescribing opioids at any dosage, should carefully evaluate individual benefits and risks when considering increasing dosage, and should avoid increasing dosage above levels likely to yield diminishing returns in benefits relative to risks to patients (recommendation category: A; evidence type: 3).</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Implementation Considerations</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>• The recommendations related to opioid dosages are not intended to be used as an inflexible, rigid standard of care; rather, they are intended to be guideposts to help inform clinician-patient decision-making. Risks of opioid use, including risk for overdose and overdose death, increase continuously with dosage, and there is no single dosage threshold below which risks are eliminated. Therefore, the recommendation language emphasizes that clinicians should avoid increasing dosage above levels likely to yield diminishing returns in benefits relative to risks to patients rather than emphasizing a single specific numeric threshold. Further, these recommendations apply specifically to starting opioids or to increasing opioid dosages, and a different set of benefits and risks applies to reducing opioid dosages (see Recommendation 5).  3) Do not use the calculated dose in MMEs to determine the doses to use when converting one opioid to another; when converting opioids, the new opioid is typically dosed at a substantially lower dose than the calculated MME dose to avoid overdose because of incomplete cross-tolerance and individual variability in opioid pharmacokinetics. 4) Use particular caution with methadone dose conversions because methadone has a long and variable half-life, and peak respiratory depressant effect occurs later and lasts longer than peak analgesic effect. 5) Use particular caution with transdermal fentanyl because it is dosed in mcg/hr instead of mg/day, and its absorption is affected by heat and other factors. 6) Buprenorphine products approved for the treatment of pain are not included in the table because of their partial µ-receptor agonist activity and resultant ceiling effects compared with full µ-receptor agonists. 7) These conversion factors should not be applied to dosage decisions related to the management of opioid use disorder. † Tapentadol is a µ-receptor agonist and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. MMEs are based on degree of µ-receptor agonist activity; however, it is unknown whether tapentadol is associated with overdose in the same dose-dependent manner as observed with medications that are solely µ-receptor agonists. § Tramadol is a µ-receptor agonist and norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake inhibitor. MMEs are based on degree of µ-receptor agonist activity; however, it is unknown whether tramadol is associated with overdose in the same dosedependent manner as observed with medications that are solely µ-receptor agonists.</paragraph>
<paragraph>other treatments and effectiveness, and patient values and preferences. The recommendations related to opioid dosages are not intended to be used as an inflexible, rigid standard of care; rather, they are intended to be guideposts to help inform clinician-patient decision-making.</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Supporting Rationale</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>Benefits of high-dose opioids for pain are not well established. Few trials evaluated opioid dosages of ≥90 MME/day</paragraph>
<paragraph>At the same time, risks for serious harms related to opioid therapy, including opioid misuse, overdose, and death, increase at higher opioid dosage, without a single point below which there is no risk</paragraph>
<paragraph>Four observational studies identified in the clinical evidence reviews consistently found an association between higher doses of long-term opioids and risk for overdose or overdose death</paragraph>
<paragraph>Multiple experts from OWG expressed concern that including specific dosage thresholds in a main recommendation statement would emphasize them as authoritative absolutes and would lead to noncollaborative tapers or other potentially harmful consequences. Experts also noted the lack of a single standard formula for calculating MMEs</paragraph>
<paragraph>When opioids are used for acute, subacute, or chronic pain, clinicians should start opioids at the lowest possible effective dosage. For patients not already taking opioids, the lowest effective dose can be determined using product labeling as a starting point with calibration as needed on the basis of the severity of pain and other clinical factors, such as renal or hepatic insufficiency (see</paragraph>
<paragraph>Clinicians should generally avoid unnecessary dosage increases, use caution when increasing opioid dosages, and increase dosage by the smallest practical amount because overdose risk increases with increases in opioid dosage. Although evidence to recommend specific intervals for dosage titration is limited, rapid dosage increases put patients at greater risk for sedation, respiratory depression, and overdose. For opioid-naïve outpatients with acute pain treated with an opioid for a few days or less, dosage increases are usually unnecessary and should not be attempted without close monitoring because of the risks for respiratory depression. In the context of longterm opioid use, when dosage is increased, clinicians should reevaluate patients after increasing dosage for changes in pain, function, and risk for harm (see</paragraph>
<paragraph>Before increasing total opioid dosage to ≥50 MME/day, clinicians should pause, considering that dosage increases to >50 MME/day are unlikely to provide substantially improved pain control for most patients while overdose risk increases with dosage, and carefully reassess evidence of benefits and risks. If a patient's opioid dosage for all sources of opioids combined reaches or exceeds 50 MME/day, clinicians should implement additional precautions, including increased frequency of follow-up (see</paragraph>
<paragraph>Additional dosage increases beyond 50 MME/day are progressively more likely to yield diminishing returns in benefits for pain and function relative to risks to patients. Clinicians should carefully evaluate a decision to increase dosage after an individualized assessment of benefits and risks and weighing factors such as diagnosis, incremental benefits for pain and function relative to risks with previous dosage increases, other treatments and effectiveness, and patient values and preferences.</paragraph>
<paragraph>Certain states require clinicians to implement clinical protocols at specific dosage levels. For example, before increasing long-term opioid therapy dosage to >120 MME/day, clinicians in Washington state must obtain consultation from a pain specialist who agrees that the increase is indicated and appropriate</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Implementation Considerations</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>• Clinicians should carefully weigh both the benefits and risks of continuing opioid medications and the benefits and risks of tapering opioids.</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Supporting Rationale</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>Patients receiving long-term, high-dosage opioid therapy for chronic pain are at increased risk for adverse events including overdose death</paragraph>
<paragraph>Discontinuation of opioids has been associated with greater risks when it occurs over shorter periods. FDA has advised that risks of rapid tapering or sudden discontinuation of opioids in physically dependent patients include acute withdrawal symptoms, exacerbation of pain, serious psychological distress, and thoughts of suicide</paragraph>
<paragraph>Experts from OWG said they appreciated the complexity of managing patients already receiving higher dosages of opioids long-term. Although some experts indicated there should be more consideration of obtaining informed consent before tapering opioids, others believed that informed discussion is more appropriate than informed consent when considering US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tapering opioids because of clinicians' overriding responsibility to avoid providing treatment that harms patients. Some experts were concerned that overemphasizing risks of tapering could increase harm from continued high-dosage opioid use.</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Determining Whether, When, and How to Taper Opioids</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>The benefits and risks of opioid therapy change over time and should be reevaluated periodically (see Recommendations 6 and 7). Opioid therapy should be limited to circumstances where benefits of therapy outweigh risks. Because tapering opioids can be harmful in some circumstances, benefits of continuing opioids in patients who have already received them long-term might include avoiding risks of tapering and discontinuing opioids. In situations where benefits and risks of continuing opioids are considered to be close or unclear, shared decision-making with patients is particularly important. At times, clinicians and patients might not be able to agree on whether tapering is necessary. When patients and clinicians are unable to arrive at a consensus on the assessment of benefits and risks, clinicians should acknowledge this discordance, express empathy, and seek to implement treatment changes in a patient-centered manner while avoiding patient abandonment. Unless there is a life-threatening issue such as warning signs of an imminent overdose, the benefits of rapidly tapering or abruptly discontinuing opioids are unlikely to outweigh the substantial risks of these practices</paragraph>
<paragraph>Consistent with the HHS Guide for Clinicians on the Appropriate Dosage Reduction or Discontinuation of Long-Term Opioid Analgesics</paragraph>
<paragraph>• the patient requests dosage reduction or discontinuation,</paragraph>
<paragraph>• pain improves and might indicate resolution of an underlying cause, • opioid therapy has not meaningfully reduced pain or improved function, • the patient has been treated with opioids for a prolonged period (e.g., years) and the benefit-risk balance is unclear (e.g., decreased positive effects because of tolerance and symptoms such as reduced focus or memory that might be due to opioids), • the patient is receiving higher opioid dosages without evidence of benefit from the higher dosage, • the patient experiences side effects that diminish quality of life or impair function, • evidence of opioid misuse exists, • the patient experiences an overdose or other serious event (e.g., an event leading to hospitalization or injury) or has warning signs for an impending event (e.g., confusion, sedation, or slurred speech), or • the patient is receiving medications (e.g., benzodiazepines) or has medical conditions (e.g., sleep apnea, liver disease, kidney disease, or fall risk) that increase risk for adverse outcomes. For patients already taking opioids long term (both established patients and patients transferring from other clinicians), the possibility of opioid dosage reduction might provoke substantial anxiety. In addition, tapering opioids after years of taking them can be especially challenging because of physical and psychological dependence. However, patients should be offered the opportunity to reevaluate their continued use of opioids. Clinicians should review benefits and risks of continued opioid therapy with empathy.</paragraph>
<paragraph>Whenever possible, clinicians should collaborate with patients and share decision-making about whether and how to taper opioids. Clinicians should review benefits and risks of opioid therapy with the patient and decide whether tapering is appropriate for the patient. If the existing opioid regimen does not put the patient at imminent risk for overdose or other injury, tapering does not need to occur immediately, and clinicians can take time to reach agreement with patients</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Providing Advice to Patients Before Tapering</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>Clinicians should advise patients that overall, after voluntary reduction of long-term opioid dosages, most patients report stable or improved function, anxiety, and mood without worsening pain or with decreased pain levels</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Pain Management During Tapering</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>Clinicians should commit to working with patients to improve function and decrease pain, whether or not opioids are tapered. Nonpharmacologic and nonopioid treatments should be integrated into patients' pain management plans after an individualized assessment of benefits and risks that considers the patient's diagnosis, circumstances, and unique needs (see Recommendation 2). Integrating behavioral and nonopioid pain therapies before and during a taper can help manage pain</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Behavioral Health Support During Tapering</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>Integrating behavioral and nonopioid pain therapies and treatment for comorbid mental health conditions before and during a taper can help manage pain</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Tapering Rate</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>Evidence to support specific tapering rates is limited. The rate of tapering should be individualized based on the patient's clinical situation. When opioids are reduced or discontinued, a taper slow enough to minimize symptoms and signs of opioid withdrawal (e.g., anxiety, insomnia, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, diaphoresis, mydriasis, tremor, tachycardia, or piloerection) should be used. Tapers can be completed over several months to years depending on the opioid dosage and should be individualized based on patient goals and concerns. Longer durations of previous opioid therapy might require longer tapers. Evidence on optimal taper rate is emerging. Tapers of approximately 10% per month or slower are likely to be better US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tolerated than more rapid tapers when patients have been taking opioids for longer durations (e.g., ≥1 year)</paragraph>
<paragraph>More rapid tapers might be needed for patient safety under certain circumstances (e.g., for patients who have experienced overdose on their current dosage)</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Management of Opioid Withdrawal During Tapering</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>The first approach to withdrawal symptoms and signs should generally be consideration of slowing or pausing the taper rate. If needed, short-term oral medications might also help manage withdrawal symptoms</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Challenges to Tapering</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>Some patients with unanticipated challenges to tapering, such as inability to make progress in tapering despite opioidrelated harm, might have undiagnosed opioid use disorder. Therefore, patients experiencing such challenges should be assessed for opioid use disorder using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) criteria and, if criteria for opioid use disorder are met, offered evidencebased medication treatment (see</paragraph>
<paragraph>Emerging evidence suggests that patients for whom risks of continued high-dose opioid use outweigh benefits but who are unable to taper and who do not meet criteria for opioid use disorder might benefit from transition to buprenorphine</paragraph>
<paragraph>To avoid precipitating withdrawal, transitioning any patient taking full agonist opioids to buprenorphine requires specific timing of the initial buprenorphine dose (219) (see Recommendation 12 for application to patients with opioid use disorder). Patients should be in mild to moderate withdrawal from full agonist opioids before the first buprenorphine dose</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Continuing High-Dosage Opioids</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>Clinicians should closely monitor patients who are unable to taper and who continue on high-dosage or otherwise high-risk opioid regimens (e.g., opioids prescribed concurrently with benzodiazepines) and should work with patients to mitigate overdose risk (e.g., by providing overdose education and naloxone) (see</paragraph>
<paragraph>Management of chronic pain with opioids can be challenging, as can management of opioid discontinuation</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Deciding Duration of Initial Opioid Prescription and Conducting Follow-Up Recommendation 6</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>When opioids are needed for acute pain, clinicians should prescribe no greater quantity than needed for the expected duration of pain severe enough to require opioids (recommendation category: A; evidence type: 4).</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Implementation Considerations</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>• Nontraumatic, nonsurgical acute pain can often be managed without opioids (see Recommendation 1).</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Supporting Rationale</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>Data suggest that pain improves within days for many patients with common types of acute pain in primary care or emergency department settings. Analysis of nationwide U.S. commercial insurance claims in 2014 found median durations of initial opioid analgesic prescriptions for acute pain indications in primary care settings were 4-7 days (244), suggesting that in most cases, clinicians considered an initial opioid prescription of 4-7 days' duration sufficient. Some patients (17.8%; range: 11.7%-30.0% depending on the acute pain condition) obtained at least one refill within 30 days after their initial opioid prescription, suggesting that although these durations might have been sufficient or more than necessary for most patients, variation across diagnoses and among patients in time to recovery is likely. In an older study of the course of acute low back pain (not associated with malignancies, infections, spondyloarthropathies, fractures, or neurologic signs) in a primary care setting, a large decrease in pain occurred until the fourth day after treatment with paracetamol, with smaller decreases thereafter</paragraph>
<paragraph>Since 2017, multiple studies have found that many patients do not use all prescribed opioids after surgery and that prescribing a lower quantity of opioids postoperatively is associated with less opioid use without increases in pain score or in requests for refills of pain medication and without reductions in satisfaction with pain management</paragraph>
<paragraph>Clinical evidence reviews found observational evidence that opioid use for acute pain is associated with long-term opioid use and that a greater amount of early opioid exposure is associated with greater likelihood of long-term use, noting recent evidence for a dose-and duration-dependent effects</paragraph>
<paragraph>Many common causes of nonsurgical, nontraumatic acute pain can often be managed without opioids (see Recommendation 1). When the diagnosis and severity of acute pain warrant the use of opioids, clinicians should prescribe no greater quantity than needed for the expected duration of pain severe enough to require opioids. A few days or less are often sufficient when opioids are needed for many common causes of nonsurgical acute pain, and limiting the duration of opioid therapy can minimize the need to taper to prevent withdrawal symptoms at the end of the course of opioids and limit unused opioids. Certain circumstances (e.g., severe traumatic injuries) might require use of opioids for durations of >7 days. Durations should be individualized based on the patient's clinical circumstances.</paragraph>
<paragraph>When patients are discharged from the hospital after surgery, the course and dosage of any opioid medications administered during hospitalization and before discharge can help predict ongoing pain management needs</paragraph>
<paragraph>Clinicians should generally not prescribe additional opioids to patients just in case pain continues longer than expected. However, if pain continues longer than expected, some patients might face challenges in successfully navigating the health care system (e.g., clinician and pharmacy contact, transportation, and need for assistance) to obtain additional medication as needed, leading to potential disparities in treatment. Clinicians, practices, and health systems should have mechanisms in place for the subset of patients who experience severe acute pain that continues longer than the expected duration. These mechanisms should allow for timely reevaluation to confirm or revise the initial diagnosis and adjust pain management accordingly. In particular, clinicians, practices, and health systems should ensure all patients can obtain and afford additional evaluation and treatment as needed to minimize disparities in access to and affordability of care and refills.</paragraph>
<paragraph>Patients should be evaluated at least every 2 weeks if they continue to receive opioids for acute pain. If opioids are continued for ≥1 month, clinicians should ensure that potentially reversible causes of chronic pain are addressed and that opioid prescribing for acute pain does not unintentionally become long-term opioid therapy simply because medications are continued without reassessment. Continuation of opioid therapy at this point might represent initiation of long-term opioid therapy, which should occur only as an intentional decision that benefits are likely to outweigh risks after discussion between the clinician and patient and as part of a comprehensive pain management approach. Clinicians should refer to recommendations on subacute and chronic pain for initiation (Recommendation 2), follow-up (Recommendation 7), and tapering (Recommendation 5) of ongoing opioid therapy. If patients already receiving longterm opioids require additional opioids for superimposed severe acute pain (e.g., major surgery), opioids should be continued only for the duration of pain severe enough to require additional opioids, returning to the patient's baseline opioid dosage as soon as possible, including a taper to baseline dosage if additional opioids were used around the clock for more than a few days.</paragraph>
<paragraph>If opioids are used continuously (around the clock) for more than a few days for acute pain, clinicians should prescribe a brief taper to minimize withdrawal symptoms on discontinuation of opioids. Taper durations might need to be adjusted depending on the duration of the initial opioid prescription. For example, if opioids are used continuously for >3 days but for <1 week, clinicians can consider reducing the daily dosage to 50% for 2 days to ameliorate withdrawal symptoms when discontinuing opioids. When patients have taken opioids continuously for ≥1 week but <1 month, clinicians might consider a slower taper (e.g., reducing the daily dosage by approximately 20% every 2 days, a range consistent with tapering rates successfully used in studies of postoperative opioid prescribing)</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Recommendation 7</sectionHeader>

<sectionHeader>Clinicians should evaluate benefits and risks with patients within 1-4 weeks of starting opioid therapy for subacute or chronic pain or of dosage escalation. Clinicians should regularly reevaluate benefits and risks of continued opioid therapy with patients (recommendation category: A; evidence type: 4).</sectionHeader>

<sectionHeader>Implementation Considerations</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>• In addition to evaluating benefits and risks of opioids before starting opioid therapy (see Recommendation 2), clinicians should evaluate patients to assess benefits and risks of opioids within 1-4 weeks of starting long-term opioid therapy or of dosage escalation.</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Supporting Rationale</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>Although clinical evidence reviews did not find studies evaluating the effectiveness of more frequent monitoring intervals</paragraph>
<paragraph>Experts from OWG noted that although little evidence exists for specific follow-up time frames, the recommendation was reasonable and reflects common practice and therefore supported the recommendation. Experts further noted that social determinants of health affecting ability to return frequently for care (e.g., role as unpaid caregiver or work at a job with minimal paid time off ) or payer issues (e.g., copays) could have consequences when recommending frequent visits and should be considered.</paragraph>
<paragraph>Clinicians should evaluate patients to assess benefits and risks of opioids within 1-4 weeks of starting long-term opioid therapy or of dosage escalation. Clinicians should consider follow-up intervals within the lower end of this range when ER/LA opioids are started or increased, because of the increased risk for overdose within the first 2 weeks of treatment</paragraph>
<paragraph>Patients who started opioid therapy for acute pain and are continuing to receive opioids for subacute pain might be at a particularly critical point for potential transition to chronic pain and potential transition to long-term opioid therapy. Clinicians should follow up with and evaluate patients with subacute pain who have been treated with opioid therapy for 30 days. Clinicians should ensure that opioid prescribing for acute pain does not unintentionally become long-term opioid therapy simply because medications are continued without reassessment, but only as an intentional decision that benefits are likely to outweigh risks after discussion between the clinician and patient. Clinicians should reassess the patient's pain, function, and treatment course; ensure that potentially reversible causes of chronic pain are addressed; and optimize pain management as needed (see</paragraph>
<paragraph>In analyses of placebo-controlled trials, the clinical evidence reviews found that effects of opioids on mean improvement in pain and in function were greater at 1-3 months than at 3-6 months</paragraph>
<paragraph>At follow-up, clinicians should review patient perspectives on progress and challenges in moving toward treatment goals; determine whether opioids continue to meet treatment goals, including sustained improvement in pain and function; determine whether the patient has experienced common or serious adverse events or early warning signs of serious adverse events or has signs of opioid misuse or opioid use disorder (e.g., difficulty controlling use, cravings, work, and social or family problems related to opioid use); determine whether benefits of opioids continue to outweigh risks; and determine whether there is a need for opioid dosage reduction or discontinuation. Clinicians should assess benefits in function, pain control, and quality of life by asking patients about progress toward personcentered functional goals that have meaning for them (see Recommendation 2) or by using tools such as the three-item PEG assessment scale</paragraph>
<paragraph>If risks outweigh benefits of continued opioid therapy (e.g., if patients do not experience meaningful, sustained improvements in pain and function compared with before initiation of opioid therapy; if patients are taking higher-risk regimens [e.g., dosages of ≥50 MME/day or opioids combined with benzodiazepines] without evidence of benefit; if patients believe benefits no longer outweigh risks; if patients request dosage reduction or discontinuation; or if patients experience overdose or other serious adverse events), clinicians should work with patients to taper and reduce opioid dosage or to taper and discontinue opioids when possible (see</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Assessing Risk and Addressing Potential Harms of Opioid Use</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>Recommendation 8</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Before starting and periodically during continuation of opioid therapy, clinicians should evaluate risk for opioidrelated harms and discuss risk with patients. Clinicians should work with patients to incorporate into the management plan strategies to mitigate risk, including offering naloxone (recommendation category: A; evidence type: 4).</sectionHeader>

<sectionHeader>Implementation Considerations</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>• Clinicians should ask patients about their drug and alcohol use and use validated tools or consult with behavioral specialists to screen for and assess mental health and substance use disorders.</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Supporting Rationale</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>The clinical evidence reviews found evidence too limited to determine effects of patient demographics and comorbidities on risk for opioid-related harms</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Patients with Sleep-Disordered Breathing, Including Sleep Apnea</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>A case-control analysis among veterans prescribed opioids found that sleep apnea was associated with increased risk for life-threatening respiratory/central nervous system depression or overdose</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Pregnant Persons</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>Pregnant, postpartum, and parenting persons should receive compassionate, evidence-based care for pain or opioid use disorder. ACOG has noted that a cautious approach to prescribing opioids should be balanced with the need to address pain, and pregnancy should not be a reason to avoid treating acute pain</paragraph>
<paragraph>Clinicians and patients together should carefully weigh benefits and risks when making decisions about whether to initiate opioid therapy for pain during pregnancy. In addition, before initiating opioid therapy for persons who can become pregnant, clinicians and patients should discuss family planning and potential effects of longterm opioid use on any future pregnancy. For all persons with reproductive potential, discussing future pregnancy intentions and engaging in shared decision-making regarding contraception, if appropriate, is a core component of care. A review of all prescription and nonprescription medications is recommended during prepregnancy and interpregnancy care</paragraph>
<paragraph>ACOG has noted that early universal screening, brief intervention (e.g., engaging in a short conversation and providing feedback and advice), and referral for treatment of pregnant persons with opioid use disorder improve both maternal and infant outcomes</paragraph>
<paragraph>The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has published recommendations for the care of infants with neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, including that pregnant persons with opioid use disorder should receive antenatal counseling to provide education on the clinical signs of withdrawal and on postnatal treatment for neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (e.g., nonpharmacologic treatment, including breastfeeding, and pharmacotherapy)</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Patients with Renal or Hepatic Insufficiency</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>A case-control study of risk for life-threatening respiratory/ central nervous system depression or overdose among veterans prescribed opioids found that renal disease and moderate or severe liver disease were associated with increased risk for these events</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Patients Aged ≥65 Years</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>Older adults are a heterogenous group comprising a wide span of ages and functional abilities, ranging from healthy, active older adults to frail older adults. Frail older adults in particular can be at risk for changes in function that might be exacerbated by pain and contribute to deterioration in overall health and independence. Functional assessment is especially important in patients aged ≥65 years to better assess effects of pain on function and independence. Persons aged ≥65 years can be at risk for inadequate pain treatment</paragraph>
<paragraph>Pain management for older patients can be challenging because of increased risks of both nonopioid pharmacologic therapies (see Recommendation 2) and opioid therapy in this population. Because of reduced renal function and medication clearance even in the absence of renal disease, patients aged ≥65 years might have increased susceptibility to accumulation of all medications, increased risk for drug-drug interactions, and a smaller therapeutic window between safe dosages and dosages associated with adverse effects. These adverse effects include renal, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal effects with oral NSAIDs (see Recommendation 2) and respiratory depression and overdose with opioids. A case-control analysis among veterans prescribed opioids found that age ≥55 years was associated with increased risk for life-threatening respiratory/ central nervous system depression or overdose</paragraph>
<paragraph>Clinicians should review all current medications, overthe-counter drugs, and natural remedies before prescribing any new drugs. Clinicians should use additional caution and increased monitoring (see</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Patients in Safety Critical Jobs</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>A safety critical job involves work or an occupational environment where limitations in physical or mental performance, or both, involve dangers to self, coworkers, or the public. According to the American College Occupational Environmental Medicine, for occupations with higher risks (especially public transportation), prescription of an opioid might be incompatible with continued employment in a safety critical job</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Patients with Mental Health Conditions</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>Psychological distress frequently interferes with improvement of pain and function in patients with chronic pain; therefore, using validated instruments such as the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)-7 and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9 or PHQ-4) to support assessment for anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and depression</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Patients with Substance Use Disorders</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>Patients with substance use disorders are likely to experience greater risks for opioid use disorder and overdose</paragraph>
<paragraph>Nonprescribed drugs (e.g., heroin, illicitly manufactured fentanyl, cocaine, and methamphetamine)</paragraph>
<paragraph>If clinicians consider prescribing opioid therapy for chronic pain to patients with substance use disorders, they should discuss increased risks for opioid use disorder and overdose with patients; carefully consider whether benefits of opioids outweigh increased risks; and incorporate strategies to mitigate risk into the management plan, such as offering naloxone (see Offering Naloxone to Patients) and increasing frequency of monitoring (see</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Patients with Previous Overdose</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>Previous opioid overdose is associated with substantially increased risk for future nonfatal or fatal opioid overdose</paragraph>
<paragraph>If patients experience nonfatal opioid overdose, clinicians should evaluate them for opioid use disorder and provide or arrange treatment if needed. Treatment with buprenorphine or methadone for opioid use disorder after overdose is associated with reduced all-cause and opioid-related deaths</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Offering Naloxone to Patients</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>Naloxone is an opioid antagonist that can reverse severe respiratory depression; its administration by laypersons, such as friends, family, and caregivers of persons who experience opioid overdose, can save lives</paragraph>
<paragraph>Clinicians should offer naloxone when prescribing opioids, particularly to patients at increased risk for overdose, including patients with a history of overdose, patients with a history of substance use disorder, patients taking benzodiazepines with opioids (see</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Recommendation 9</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>When prescribing initial opioid therapy for acute, subacute, or chronic pain, and periodically during opioid therapy for chronic pain, clinicians should review the patient's history of controlled substance prescriptions using state prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP) data to determine whether the patient is receiving opioid dosages or combinations that put the patient at high risk for overdose (recommendation category: B; evidence type: 4).</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Implementation Considerations</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>• Ideally, PDMP data should be reviewed before every opioid prescription for acute, subacute, or chronic pain. This practice is recommended in all jurisdictions where PDMP availability and access policies, as well as clinical practice settings, make it practicable (e.g., clinician and delegate access permitted).</paragraph>
<paragraph>• At a minimum, during long-term opioid therapy, PDMP data should be reviewed before an initial opioid prescription and then every 3 months or more frequently. ï Discuss information from the PDMP with the patient and confirm that the patient is aware of any additional prescriptions. Because clinicians often work as part of teams, prescriptions might appropriately be written by more than one clinician coordinating the patient's care. Occasionally, PDMP information can be incorrect (e.g., if the wrong name or birthdate has been entered, the patient uses a nickname or maiden name, or another person has used the patient's identity to obtain prescriptions). ï Discuss safety concerns, including increased risk for respiratory depression and overdose, with patients found to be receiving overlapping prescription opioids from multiple clinicians who are not coordinating the patient's care or patients who are receiving medications that increase risk when combined with opioids (e.g., US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention benzodiazepines) (see</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Supporting Rationale</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>PDMPs are databases overseen by states, territories, counties, and the District of Columbia that collect information on controlled prescription drugs dispensed by pharmacies and, in selected jurisdictions, by dispensing clinicians. PDMPs do not report nonprescribed opioid use. A clinical evidence review did not find studies evaluating the effectiveness of PDMPs for risk mitigation</paragraph>
<paragraph>Special attention should be paid to ensure that PDMP information is not used in a way that is harmful to patients. For example, PDMP information has been used to dismiss patients from clinician practices</paragraph>
<paragraph>Experts raised varying points regarding frequency of PDMP use, with many agreeing that PDMPs should be consulted before every opioid prescription, several agreeing that universal application would mitigate bias in application to different patients, and others believing it might not be warranted or feasible to check the PDMP in all cases, particularly before prescribing opioids for acute pain for a small number of days.</paragraph>
<paragraph>Ideally, PDMP data should be reviewed before every opioid prescription for acute, subacute, or chronic pain. This practice is recommended in all jurisdictions where PDMP availability and access policies make it practicable (e.g., clinician and delegate access permitted). At a minimum, PDMP data should be reviewed before initial opioid prescriptions for subacute or chronic pain and then every 3 months or more frequently during long-term opioid therapy. Recommendation category B acknowledges variation in PDMP availability and circumstances (e.g., a clinician might reasonably determine that a patient with severe acute pain in the emergency department during a PDMP system access failure would be adversely affected by waiting hours for a prescription). However, because PDMP information can be most helpful when results are unexpected and, to minimize bias in application, clinicians should apply this recommendation when feasible to all patients rather than differentially on the basis of assumptions about what they will learn about specific patients.</paragraph>
<paragraph>Clinicians should review PDMP data for prescription opioids and other controlled medications patients might have received from additional prescribers to determine the total amount of MME prescribed and to assess if the total dosage or combinations (e.g., opioids combined with benzodiazepines) put the patient at high risk for overdose. If patients are found to have total opioid dosages or combinations of medications that might put them at risk for overdose, or multiple controlled substance prescriptions written by different clinicians, clinicians should take actions to improve patient safety (see Recommendation 9, Implementation Considerations).</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Recommendation 10</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>When prescribing opioids for subacute or chronic pain, clinicians should consider the benefits and risks of toxicology testing to assess for prescribed medications as well as other prescribed and nonprescribed controlled substances (recommendation category: B; evidence type: 4).</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Implementation Considerations</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>• Toxicology testing should not be used in a punitive manner but should be used in the context of other clinical information to inform and improve patient care. Clinicians should not dismiss patients from care on the basis of a toxicology test result. Dismissal could have adverse consequences for patient safety, potentially including the patient obtaining opioids or other drugs from alternative sources and the clinician missing opportunities to facilitate treatment for substance use disorder. • Before starting opioids and periodically (at least annually) during opioid therapy, clinicians should consider the benefits and risks of toxicology testing to assess for prescribed opioids and other prescription and nonprescription controlled substances that increase risk for overdose when combined with opioids, including nonprescribed and illicit opioids and benzodiazepines. • Clinicians, practices, and health systems should aim to minimize bias in testing and should not apply this recommendation differentially on the basis of assumptions about patients. • Predicting risk is challenging, and available tools do not allow clinicians to reliably identify patients who are at low risk for substance use or substance use disorders. Clinicians should consider toxicology screening results as potentially useful data, in the context of other clinical information, for all patients and consider toxicology screening whenever its potential limitations can be addressed. • Clinicians should explain to patients that toxicology testing will not be used to dismiss patients from care and is intended to improve their safety. • Clinicians should explain expected results (e.g., presence of prescribed medication and absence of drugs, including nonprescribed controlled substances not reported by the patient) and ask patients in a nonjudgmental manner about use of prescribed and other drugs and whether there might be unexpected results. • Limited toxicology screening can be performed with a relatively inexpensive presumptive immunoassay panel that tests for opiates as a class, benzodiazepines as a class, and several nonprescribed substances. Toxicology screening for a class of drugs might not detect all drugs in that class. For example, fentanyl testing is not included in widely used toxicology assays that screen for opiates as a class. • Clinicians should be familiar with the drugs included in toxicology screening panels used in their practice and should understand how to interpret results for these drugs. For example, a positive opiates immunoassay detects morphine, which might reflect patient use of morphine, codeine, or heroin, but does not detect synthetic opioids and might not detect semisynthetic opioids. In some cases, positive results for specific opioids might reflect metabolites from opioids the patient is taking and might not mean the patient is taking the specific opioid that resulted in the positive test. • Confirmatory testing should be used when ï toxicology results will inform decisions with major clinical or nonclinical implications for the patient; ï a need exists to detect specific opioids or other drugs within a class, such as those that are being prescribed, or those that cannot be identified on standard immunoassays; or US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ï a need exists to confirm unexpected screening toxicology test results. • Restricting confirmatory testing to situations and substances for which results can reasonably be expected to affect patient management can reduce costs of toxicology testing. • Clinicians might want to discuss unexpected results with the local laboratory or toxicologist and should discuss unexpected results with the patient. • Clinicians should discuss unexpected results with patients in a nonjudgmental manner, avoiding use of potentially stigmatizing language (e.g., avoid describing a specimen as testing "clean" or "dirty"). • Discussion with patients before specific confirmatory testing can sometimes yield a candid explanation of why a particular substance is present or absent and remove the need for confirmatory testing during that visit. For example, a patient might explain that the test is negative for prescribed opioids because they felt opioids were no longer helping and discontinued them. If unexpected results from toxicology screening are not explained, a confirmatory test on the same sample using a method selective enough to differentiate specific opioids and metabolites (e.g., gas or liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry) might be warranted.</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Supporting Rationale</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>The clinical evidence reviews did not find studies evaluating the effectiveness of toxicology screening for risk mitigation during opioid prescribing for pain. However, concurrent use of opioid pain medications with other opioid pain medications, benzodiazepines, or heroin or other nonpharmaceutical opioids can increase patients' risk for overdose. Toxicology tests can provide information about drug use that is not reported by the patient. In addition, toxicology tests can assist clinicians in identifying when patients are not taking opioids prescribed for them, which might in certain cases indicate diversion or other clinically important issues such as difficulties with adverse effects. The most commonly drug-tested bodily specimen is urine. Oral fluid (saliva) testing also is available</paragraph>
<paragraph>On October 25, 2019, SAMHSA published guidelines for the inclusion of oral fluid specimens in toxicology testing programs of federal executive branch agencies</paragraph>
<paragraph>Experts from OWG had concerns that biases and disparities affecting which patients undergo toxicology testing could have disproportionately negative consequences among Black and Hispanic patients. In addition, testing costs would have the greatest consequences for patients with the least ability to pay. Because of these concerns, some experts said that grading the recommendation as category A could potentially reduce bias and disparities. However, others indicated that although universal application could mitigate bias in who is tested, it would not mitigate stigma associated with testing. In addition, experts had concerns about accuracy, clinician interpretation, testing costs, and potential for a delay in care while waiting for test results.</paragraph>
<paragraph>Because of these concerns, the recommendation is rated category B. However, clinicians, practices, and health systems should aim to minimize bias in its application and should not apply this recommendation differentially on the basis of assumptions about what they will learn about specific patients. Predicting risk is challenging, and available tools do not allow clinicians to reliably identify patients who are at low risk for substance use disorder</paragraph>
<paragraph>Before starting opioids and periodically (at least annually) during opioid therapy, clinicians should consider benefits and risks of toxicology testing to assess for prescribed opioids and other prescription and nonprescribed substances that increase risk for overdose when combined with opioids, including nonprescribed and illicit opioids and benzodiazepines. Before ordering toxicology testing, clinicians should have a plan for responding to unexpected results. Clinicians should explain to patients that toxicology testing will not be used punitively (e.g., will not be used to dismiss patients from care) and is intended to improve their safety. Clinicians should also explain expected results (e.g., presence of prescribed medication and absence of substances, including nonprescribed substances, not reported by the patient). Clinicians should ask patients about use of prescribed medications and other substances and ask whether there might be unexpected results. This will provide an opportunity for patients to provide information about changes in their use of prescribed opioids or other drugs.</paragraph>
<paragraph>In most situations, initial toxicology testing can be performed with a relatively inexpensive immunoassay panel that tests for opiates and benzodiazepines as classes and for multiple nonprescribed substances. Patients prescribed oxycodone or nonmorphine-based opioids (e.g., buprenorphine or methadone) require specific testing for those agents. The use of confirmatory testing can add costs and should be used when toxicology results will inform decisions with major clinical or nonclinical implications for the patient, a need exists to detect a specific opioid that is prescribed or that cannot be identified on standard immunoassays, or to confirm unexpected toxicology screening results for which there is no other explanation. Clinicians and health systems can work to minimize inequitable cost burdens for patients and limit specific testing to situations when it is necessary. Clinicians should be familiar with the compounds included in toxicology testing panels used in their practice and should understand how to interpret results. For example, a positive opiate immunoassay test result detects morphine, which might reflect patient use of morphine, codeine, or heroin, but this immunoassay does not detect synthetic opioids (e.g., fentanyl or methadone) and might not detect semisynthetic opioids (e.g., oxycodone or buprenorphine). Many laboratories use an oxycodone immunoassay that detects oxycodone and oxymorphone; however, these agents might need to be ordered or identified separately in a toxicology testing panel. In some cases, positive results for specific opioids might reflect metabolites from opioids the patient is taking and might not mean the patient is taking the specific opioid for which the test was positive. For example, hydromorphone is a metabolite of hydrocodone, and oxymorphone is a metabolite of oxycodone. Detailed considerations for interpretation of urine toxicology test results, including which tests to order and expected results, drug detection time in urine, and drug metabolism, have been published previously</paragraph>
<paragraph>Clinicians might want to discuss unexpected results with the local laboratory or toxicologist and should discuss unexpected results with the patient. Discussion with patients before specific confirmatory testing can sometimes yield a candid explanation of why a particular substance is present or absent and obviate the need for confirmatory testing on that visit. For example, a patient might explain that the test is negative for prescribed opioids because they felt opioids were no longer helping and discontinued them. If unexpected results are not explained, a confirmatory test using a method selective enough to differentiate specific opioids and metabolites (e.g., gas or liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry) might be warranted to clarify the situation.</paragraph>
<paragraph>Clinicians should use unexpected results to improve patient safety (e.g., change pain management strategy [see</paragraph>
<paragraph>Clinicians should not dismiss patients from care on the basis of a toxicology test result. Dismissal could have adverse consequences for patient safety, potentially including the patient obtaining opioids from alternative sources and the clinician missing opportunities to facilitate treatment for a substance use disorder.</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Recommendation 11</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>Clinicians should use particular caution when prescribing opioid pain medication and benzodiazepines concurrently and consider whether benefits outweigh risks of concurrent prescribing of opioids and other central nervous system depressants (recommendation category: B; evidence type: 3).</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Implementation Considerations</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>• Although in some circumstances it might be appropriate to prescribe opioids to a patient who is also prescribed benzodiazepines (e.g., severe acute pain in a patient taking long-term, stable low-dose benzodiazepine therapy), clinicians should use particular caution when prescribing opioid pain medication and benzodiazepines concurrently.</paragraph>
<paragraph>In addition, clinicians should consider whether benefits outweigh risks for concurrent use of opioids with other central nervous system depressants (e.g., muscle relaxants, nonbenzodiazepine sedative hypnotics, and potentially sedating anticonvulsant medications such as gabapentin and pregabalin). • Buprenorphine or methadone for opioid use disorder should not be withheld from patients taking benzodiazepines or other medications that depress the central nervous system. • Clinicians should check the PDMP for concurrent controlled medications prescribed by other clinicians (see Recommendation 9) and should consider involving pharmacists as part of the management team when opioids are coprescribed with other central nervous system depressants. • In patients receiving opioids and benzodiazepines long term, clinicians should carefully weigh the benefits and risks of continuing therapy with opioids and benzodiazepines and discuss with patients and other members of the patient's care team. • Risks of concurrent opioid and benzodiazepine use are likely to be greater with unpredictable use of either medication, with use of higher-dosage opioids and higherdosage benzodiazepines in combination, or with use with other substances including alcohol (compared with longterm, stable use of lower-dosage opioids and lower-dosage benzodiazepines without other substances). • In specific situations, benzodiazepines can be beneficial, and stopping benzodiazepines can be destabilizing.</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Supporting Rationale</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>Benzodiazepines and opioids both cause central nervous system depression, and benzodiazepines can potentiate opioidinduced decreases in respiratory drive. Epidemiologic studies find concurrent benzodiazepine use in large proportions of opioid-related overdose deaths</paragraph>
<paragraph>Experts from OWG noted that rather than necessarily being a direct cause of overdose, benzodiazepines might serve as a marker of risk for overdose because of underlying conditions, in specific situations benzodiazepines can be beneficial, and that stopping benzodiazepines can be destabilizing. In addition, experts noted that long-term, stable use might be safer than erratic, unpredictable use. Because of these considerations, multiple experts indicated that recommending extreme caution with concurrent prescription of opioid pain medications and benzodiazepines was more appropriate than a recommendation to avoid prescribing opioid pain medication and benzodiazepines concurrently and that category B would be more appropriate than category A for this recommendation.</paragraph>
<paragraph>Although in certain circumstances it might be appropriate to prescribe opioids to a patient receiving benzodiazepines (e.g., severe acute pain in a patient taking long-term, stable low-dosage benzodiazepine therapy), clinicians should use particular caution when prescribing opioid pain medication and benzodiazepines concurrently. In addition, because other central nervous system depressants (e.g., muscle relaxants, nonbenzodiazepine sedative hypnotics, and potentially sedating anticonvulsant medications such as gabapentin and pregabalin)</paragraph>
<paragraph>In patients receiving opioids and benzodiazepines longterm, clinicians should carefully weigh the benefits and risks of continuing therapy with opioids and benzodiazepines and discuss with patients and other members of the patient's care team, as appropriate. In specific situations, benzodiazepines can be beneficial, and stopping benzodiazepines can be destabilizing. As emphasized in an FDA advisory</paragraph>
<paragraph>If risks are determined to outweigh benefits of continuing opioids for pain and benzodiazepine therapy at current dosages, decisions about tapering medications (e.g., whether to taper opioids first, taper benzodiazepines first, or consider carefully transitioning from full agonist opioids to buprenorphine before tapering benzodiazepines) should be individualized and reevaluated over time. Considerations include patient priorities, the patient's clinical considerations, the patient's response to therapeutic changes, consultation with other clinicians managing the patient's care, and, consultation with other specialists (e.g., an addiction specialist) if needed. Clinicians should taper benzodiazepines gradually before discontinuation because abrupt withdrawal can be associated with rebound anxiety, hallucinations, seizures, delirium tremens, and, rarely, death</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Recommendation 12</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>Clinicians should offer or arrange treatment with evidencebased medications to treat patients with opioid use disorder. Detoxification on its own, without medications for opioid use disorder, is not recommended for opioid use disorder because of increased risks for resuming drug use, overdose, and overdose death (recommendation category: A; evidence type: 1).</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Implementation Considerations</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>• Although stigma can reduce the willingness of persons with opioid use disorder to seek treatment, opioid use disorder is a chronic, treatable disease from which persons can recover and continue to lead healthy lives. • If clinicians suspect opioid use disorder, they should discuss their concern with their patient in a nonjudgmental manner and provide an opportunity for the patient to disclose related concerns or problems. • Clinicians should assess for the presence of opioid use disorder using DSM-5 criteria. • Clinicians prescribing opioids should identify treatment resources for opioid use disorder in the community, establish a network of referral options that span the levels of care that patients might need to enable rapid collaboration and referral, when needed, and work together to ensure sufficient treatment capacity for opioid use disorder at the practice level. • Although identification of an opioid use disorder can alter the expected benefits and risks of opioid therapy for pain, patients with co-occurring pain and opioid use disorder require ongoing pain management that maximizes benefits relative to risks.</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Supporting Rationale</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>Opioid use disorder (previously known as opioid abuse or opioid dependence in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition [DSM-IV])</paragraph>
<paragraph>Opioid use disorder is manifested by at least two of 11 defined criteria occurring within a year (317):</paragraph>
<paragraph>1. Opioids are often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than was intended. 2. There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful attempts to cut down or control opioid use. 9. Continued opioid use despite knowledge of having a persistent or recurrent physical or psychological problem that is likely to have been caused or exacerbated by the substance. 10. Tolerance, as defined by either of the following: a. a need for markedly increased amounts of opioids to achieve intoxication or desired effect, or b. a markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of an opioid. 11. Withdrawal, as manifested by either of the following: a. the characteristic opioid withdrawal syndrome, or b. opioids (or a closely related substance) are taken to relieve or avoid withdrawal symptoms. Criteria 10 and 11 are not considered to be met for those persons taking opioids solely under appropriate medical supervision</paragraph>
<paragraph>FDA-approved medications indicated for the treatment of opioid use disorder include buprenorphine (a partial agonist opioid), methadone (a full agonist opioid), and naltrexone (an opioid antagonist). Experts from OWG stated that partial agonist opioid, full agonist opioid, and opioid antagonist treatment should not be framed as equal options for opioid use disorder, noting that partial and full agonist opioid treatments have stronger evidence for better outcomes, do not require abstinence, have less challenges with initiation, and are much more widely used than opioid antagonist treatment. Clinical evidence reviews found evidence on the effectiveness of interventions (e.g., medications and behavioral treatments) for opioid use disorder related to prescription opioids to be limited</paragraph>
<paragraph>Certain studies suggest that using behavioral therapies in combination with medications for opioid use disorder can reduce opioid misuse and increase retention during treatment</paragraph>
<paragraph>If clinicians suspect opioid use disorder on the basis of patient concerns or behaviors or on findings in PDMP data (see</paragraph>
<paragraph>For patients meeting criteria for opioid use disorder, particularly if moderate or severe, clinicians should offer or arrange for patients to receive evidence-based treatment with medications for opioid use disorder. Patients with opioid use disorder might benefit from counseling and referrals to mutual help groups such as Narcotics Anonymous</paragraph>
<paragraph>For pregnant persons with opioid use disorder, medications for opioid use disorder (buprenorphine or methadone) have been associated with improved maternal outcomes and should be offered as early as possible in pregnancy to prevent harms to both the patient and the fetus (see Recommendation 8)</paragraph>
<paragraph>In April 2021, to expand access to buprenorphine, the Practice Guidelines for the Administration of Buprenorphine for Treating Opioid Use Disorder</paragraph>
<paragraph>Additional recommendations have been published on initiation, use, and monitoring of buprenorphine treatment for opioid use disorder</paragraph>
<paragraph>Importantly, opioid dosage thresholds for caution in the treatment of pain are not applicable to opioid agonist treatment of opioid use disorder</paragraph>
<paragraph>Compared with buprenorphine, which can be prescribed by clinicians with a waiver in any setting or dispensed from a SAMHSA-certified opioid treatment program, ongoing methadone treatment for opioid use disorder can only be provided through an opioid treatment program. As short-term exceptions, any clinician may administer (but not prescribe) methadone or buprenorphine to treat acute opioid withdrawal for up to 3 days, while working to refer the patient to opioid use disorder treatment</paragraph>
<paragraph>Naltrexone does not require a waiver and can be prescribed in any setting. Additional recommendations have been published previously on naltrexone treatment for opioid use disorder</paragraph>
<paragraph>Clinicians are strongly encouraged to provide medication treatment for their patients with opioid use disorder. Those unable to provide treatment themselves should arrange for patients with opioid use disorder to receive care from a colleague who is able to provide treatment, from a substance use disorder treatment specialist (e.g., an office-based buprenorphine or naltrexone treatment clinician), or from an opioid treatment program certified by SAMHSA to provide methadone or buprenorphine for patients with opioid use disorder. Resources to help clinicians arrange for treatment include SAMHSA's buprenorphine physician locator (</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Management of Opioid Misuse That Does Not Meet Criteria for Opioid Use Disorder</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>Clinicians can have challenges distinguishing between opioid misuse behaviors without opioid use disorder and mild or moderate opioid use disorder</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Pain Management for Patients with Opioid Use Disorder</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>Although identification of an opioid use disorder can alter the expected benefits and risks of opioid therapy for pain, patients with co-occurring pain and substance use disorder require ongoing pain management that maximizes benefits relative to risks. Clinicians should use nonpharmacologic and nonopioid pharmacologic pain treatments as appropriate</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Conclusion and Future Directions</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>CDC indicated the intent to evaluate and reassess the 2016 CDC Opioid Prescribing Guideline as new evidence became available and determine when sufficient new evidence would prompt an update</paragraph>
<paragraph>The new evidence reviews conducted by AHRQ's Evidencebased Practice Centers affirmed the appropriateness of the recommendations in the 2016 CDC Opioid Prescribing Guideline for using opioids to treat chronic pain. The reviews also prompted CDC to modify the recommendations to include acute and subacute pain more explicitly. This updated clinical practice guideline also includes a new topline recommendation for patients who are already receiving ongoing opioid therapy for pain. Specifically, the clinical practice guideline outlines how clinicians and patients should work together in assessing the benefits and risks of continued opioid use and if or when to taper opioids to a lower dosage or discontinue opioids altogether in accordance with the HHS Tapering Guide</paragraph>
<paragraph>Four key areas are covered in this clinical practice guideline for prescribing of opioid pain medication for patients aged ≥18 years for pain, excluding pain management related to sickle cell disease, cancer-related pain treatment, palliative care, and end-of-life care. These areas are 1) determining whether or not to initiate opioids for pain; 2) selecting opioids and determining opioid dosages; 3) deciding duration of initial opioid prescription and conducting follow-up; and 4) assessing risk and addressing potential harms of opioid use. In addition, five guiding principles were identified to inform implementation across recommendations. These guiding principles focus on 1) the appropriate treatment of pain; 2) flexibility to meet the care needs and clinical circumstances of each patient; 3) a multimodal and multidisciplinary approach to pain management; 4) avoiding misapplication of the clinical practice guideline beyond its intended use; and 5) vigilance in attending to health inequities and ensuring access to appropriate, affordable, diversified, coordinated, and effective nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic pain treatment for all persons.</paragraph>
<paragraph>A central tenet of this clinical practice guideline is that acute, subacute, and chronic pain needs to be appropriately and effectively treated regardless of whether opioids are part of a treatment regimen. Clinicians should select nonpharmacologic or pharmacologic treatment modalities, or both, that maximize patient safety and optimize outcomes in pain, function, and quality of life. A multimodal and multidisciplinary approach to pain management that considers the biologic, psychological, and social characteristics of each person is critical</paragraph>
<paragraph>An integral part of providing access to and delivery of highquality health care, including pain treatment, is understanding how the social determinants of health influence the health care provided and the differential outcomes observed</paragraph>
<paragraph>Outcomes such as function and quality of life also are influenced by the health care context</paragraph>
<paragraph>To avoid unintended consequences for patients, this clinical practice guideline should not be misapplied, or policies derived from it, beyond its intended use</paragraph>
<paragraph>This clinical practice guideline provides overarching voluntary recommendations on the use of opioids to manage pain. To assist in the uptake and understanding of this new clinical practice guideline, CDC will provide tools and resources for clinicians, health systems, patients, and others on the use of opioid and nonopioid pain treatments. The uptake and widespread use of the 2016 CDC Opioid Prescribing Guideline hinged on its successful dissemination, and CDC supported its translation and integration in clinical practice. CDC produced a checklist and mobile app so clinicians could more readily apply guideline recommendations; developed fact sheets, posters, and public service announcements to make the guideline more accessible and understandable to clinicians and patients; and developed a 14-module interactive, webbased training with self-paced learning, case-based content, knowledge checks, and integrated resources for clinicians</paragraph>
<paragraph>CDC will work with public and private payers by sharing evidence that can be used to inform decisions about coverage for nonpharmacologic treatments, access to nonopioid pain medication, support for patient counseling and coordination of care, access to evidence-based treatments of opioid use disorder, and availability of multidisciplinary and multimodal care. Robust coverage and access (e.g., limited utilization management and cost sharing for evidence-based treatments) and decision support (e.g., adjustment of EHR prescribing defaults) can be used to facilitate and encourage evidence-based treatments as default treatments for pain</paragraph>
<paragraph>This clinical practice guideline updates and expands the recommendations in the 2016 CDC Opioid Prescribing Guideline using the best available evidence as interpreted and informed by expert opinion and attending to the values and preferences expressed by patients, caregivers, and clinicians. Although the strength of the evidence is sometimes low quality and research gaps remain (Box 5), clinical scientific evidence continues to advance and supports the recommendations in this clinical practice guideline</paragraph>
<paragraph>The principal aim of this clinical practice guideline is to ensure persons have equitable access to safe and effective pain management that improves their function and quality of life while illuminating and reducing risks associated with prescription opioids. CDC will evaluate this clinical practice guideline to identify the effects of the recommendations on clinician and patient outcomes and on health disparities, including intended and unintended consequences. Communication between clinicians and patients about the benefits and risks of opioids should be central to treatment decisions for patients in pain. This clinical practice guideline can help inform those decisions and assist clinicians in meeting the unique needs of each person. CDC will revisit this clinical practice guideline when remaining evidence gaps have sufficiently been addressed and another update is warranted. US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention BOX 5. Areas for additional research to build the evidence base for optimal pain management • Efficacy of screening tools to assess risk for opioid misuse and developing an opioid use disorder. Across reviews, the main outcomes were pain, function, and quality of life. Harms varied depending on the therapy evaluated but included serious adverse events when reported; for opioids, key harms included overdose and harms related to opioid use disorder. The reviews of therapies for chronic pain assessed outcomes at short-(1 to <6 months), intermediate-(6 to <12 months), and long-term follow-up (≥12 months). The reviews of therapies for acute pain assessed outcomes at <1 day, 1 day to <1 week, 1 week to <2 weeks, and 2-4 weeks; the review of treatments for acute nonmigraine pain also evaluated outcomes at ≥4 weeks. All reviews included key questions (KQs) or subquestions on how benefits and harms varied according to demographic (age, sex, race), clinical (severity and duration of pain, medical and psychiatric comorbidities, concomitant medications), and intervention (dose, duration, intensity) characteristics.</paragraph>
<paragraph>The systematic clinical evidence reviews addressed questions regarding the effectiveness and comparative effectiveness of noninvasive nonpharmacologic treatments; nonopioid pharmacologic treatments; and opioid treatments for chronic pain, acute pain, and episodic migraine pain (details including questions are available in the full AHRQ reports) (1-5).</paragraph>

<paragraph>Clinical Questions</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Opioids for Chronic Pain</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>The AHRQ systematic clinical evidence review on opioids for chronic pain (1) updated the 2014 AHRQ report</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Effectiveness (Benefits and Harms)</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>For short-term (1 to <6 month) outcomes, based on over 70 placebo-controlled trials (evidence type 1), opioids were associated with beneficial effects versus placebo but mean differences were small: for pain, <1 point on a 0-10 scale and for function, a SMD of 0.22 or <1 point on the 0-to 10-point Brief Pain Inventory</paragraph>
<paragraph>Opioids were associated with increased risk versus placebo for discontinuation because of adverse events (number of patients treated to cause one adverse event [number needed to harm, NNH 10], and increased risk for gastrointestinal events [NNH 7.1 for nausea, 14.3 for vomiting, and 7.1 for constipation], somnolence [NNH 11.1], dizziness [NNH 12.5], and pruritus [NNH 14.3]) (evidence type 1). Few serious adverse events and no difference between opioids versus placebo in risk were reported in the short-term trials (evidence type 2); however, serious adverse events were not well defined by the trials, the trials excluded patients at higher risk (e.g., those with a history of substance use disorder), and the trials were not designed to assess serious but less common harms such as overdose, opioid use disorder death, cardiovascular events, and fractures. EERW studies tended to report lower risk with opioids of discontinuation because of adverse events and gastrointestinal adverse events than non-EERW studies. Uncontrolled studies (studies without a nonopioid control group) were not included in the AHRQ review, although a recent systematic review with such studies found that rates of misuse ranged from 21% to 29% (95% CI: 13%-38%) and rates of addiction ranged from 8% to 12% (95% CI: 3%-17%), based on higher-quality observational evidence</paragraph>
<paragraph>As in the 2014 AHRQ report and 2016 CDC update, the clinical evidence review identified no long-term (>1 year) randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of opioid therapy versus placebo. One new cohort study found long-term opioid therapy was not associated with improved pain, function, or other outcomes versus no opioids</paragraph>
<paragraph>No differences were found across 16 trials between opioids versus nonopioids (most commonly NSAIDs, gabapentinoids, and nortriptyline) in short-term pain, function, health status or quality of life, sleep quality, or mental health outcomes (evidence type 1 for function; evidence type 2 for other outcomes), although opioids were associated with increased risk for shortterm adverse effects (evidence type 1 or 2). Most trials were <6 months; one trial of patients with chronic low back pain or pain associated with osteoarthritis (mean pain intensity: 5.4 on a 0-10 scale at baseline) evaluated outcomes at 1 year (29). The trial found no differences between stepped therapy with opioids versus stepped therapy starting with nonopioids in function, sleep, or mental health outcomes; opioids were associated with slightly worse effects (by approximately 0.5 point on a 0-10 scale) on pain (evidence type 2). Although tramadol was an option in step 3 of the nonopioid stepped therapy arm, only 11% received tramadol; mean opioid doses for stepped opioid therapy and stepped therapy starting with nonopioids were 26 versus 1 MME/day, respectively, at 12 months. Also, there were no differences between combination therapy versus a nonopioid alone in short-term effectiveness but increased risk for short-term adverse effects for combination therapy, on the basis of six trials (evidence type 3). Combination therapy was associated with a small (5-13 MME/day) opioidsparing effect versus opioid therapy alone, with little effect on pain. All trials of combination therapy evaluated patients with neuropathic pain and primarily evaluated gabapentinoids or nortriptyline. Evidence on long-term effects of combination therapy versus an opioid or nonopioid alone was lacking.</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Opioid Dosing Strategies</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>Evidence on the effectiveness of different opioid dosing strategies remains limited. One trial included in the 2014 AHRQ report found no differences between a more liberal dosage escalation strategy versus maintenance of current dosages in pain, function, or discontinuation because of opioid misuse; however, the difference in opioid dosages between arms was small (52 versus 40 mg MMD/day) (30) (evidence type 3). No clear differences were found between short-versus longacting opioids (evidence type 3) or between different longacting opioids (evidence type 2) in pain or function; however, in most trials, dosages were titrated to achieve adequate pain control. Evidence on comparative risks of methadone versus other opioids and risk for overdose remains limited and inconsistent. Evidence on the benefits and harms of different methods for initiating and titrating opioids, scheduled and continuous versus as-needed dosing of opioids, use of opioid rotation, and methods for titrating or discontinuing opioids remains insufficient. The 2014 AHRQ report found buccal or intranasal fentanyl more effective than placebo or oral opioids for treatment of exacerbations of chronic pain, based on immediate effects (up to 2 hours after administration). None of the trials of buccal or intranasal fentanyl was designed to assess longer-term benefits or harms, and no new trials were identified for the 2020 systematic review. In 2007, the Food and Drug Administration released a public health advisory due to case reports of deaths and other life-threatening adverse effects in patients prescribed buccal fentanyl</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Risk Mitigation Strategies</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>New evidence on the accuracy of risk prediction instruments was consistent with the 2014 AHRQ report, which found highly inconsistent estimates of diagnostic accuracy, methodological limitations, and few studies of risk assessment instruments other than the Opioid Risk Tool</paragraph>
<paragraph>No trial compared different rates of opioid tapering, although one observational study found an association between longer time to opioid discontinuation in patients on long-term, high-dosage opioid therapy and decreased risk of opioidrelated emergency department visit or hospitalization (37) (evidence type 3). The review did not identify any study that evaluated the effectiveness of risk mitigation strategies, such as use of risk assessment instruments, opioid management plans, patient education, urine drug screening, PDMP data review, monitoring instruments in patients prescribed opioids, more frequent monitoring intervals, pill counts, abuse-deterrent formulations, or avoidance of coprescribing of benzodiazepines on risk for overdose, addiction, abuse or misuse.</paragraph>
<paragraph>Evidence on the effectiveness of interventions for opioid use disorder in patients with prescription opioid dependence or opioid use disorder was limited by such factors as small sample sizes, high attrition or crossover, and exclusion of patients with chronic pain.</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Noninvasive Nonpharmacologic Treatment for Chronic Pain</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>The AHRQ systematic clinical evidence review (2) focused on commonly encountered pain conditions and frequently used interventions. Selection of conditions for review was informed by stakeholder input.</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Benefits</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>Chronic Low Back Pain. The review found psychological therapies associated with small improvements versus usual care or an attention control for function and pain at short-, intermediate-, and long-term follow-up (evidence type 2). US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</paragraph>
<paragraph>Exercise, low-level laser therapy, spinal manipulation, massage, yoga, acupuncture, and multidisciplinary rehabilitation were associated with improvements in function at short-and intermediate-term follow-up versus usual care, placebo, waiting list, or inactive therapies; effects on pain were small for all therapies except yoga, for which benefits were moderate (evidence type 2 at short term for exercise, massage, and yoga; evidence type 3 for others). Massage, mindfulness-based stress reduction, acupuncture, and multidisciplinary rehabilitation were associated with small short-term improvement in pain versus control (evidence type 2); exercise, low-level laser therapy, and yoga also were associated with small to moderate short-term improvement in pain, although evidence was not as strong (evidence type 3). At intermediate term, spinal manipulation, yoga, multidisciplinary rehabilitation (evidence type 2) and exercise and mindfulness-based stress reduction (evidence type 3) were associated with improved pain versus sham, usual care, or attention control; effects were small for all therapies except for yoga, for which effects were moderate. Compared with exercise, multidisciplinary rehabilitation was associated with small improvements in function and pain at short and intermediate terms (evidence type 2).</paragraph>
<paragraph>Chronic Neck Pain. The AHRQ systematic clinical evidence review found low-level laser therapy (evidence type 2) and massage (evidence type 3) associated with improved short-term function and pain for chronic neck pain. The magnitude of effect was moderate for low-level laser therapy and small for massage. Exercise was associated with small improvement in long-term function versus attention control (evidence type 3) and combination exercise was associated with improved shortand long-term function and short-term pain versus waiting list or attention control (evidence type 3). Acupuncture was associated with small improvements in short-and intermediateterm function versus sham, placebo, or usual care; however, there were no differences in pain versus sham acupuncture, an intervention meant to mimic acupuncture but without acupuncture effects (e.g., needles in nonacupuncture point, or nonpenetrating needles or pressure on acupuncture points) (evidence type 3). Pilates was associated with improved shortterm function (small effect) and pain (large effect) versus acetaminophen (evidence type 3).</paragraph>
<paragraph>Osteoarthritis Pain. The AHRQ systematic clinical evidence review found that for knee osteoarthritis, exercise was associated with small improvements in short-and long-term function and pain versus usual care, no treatment, or sham (evidence type 2 for short-term and type 3 for long-term) and moderate improvement in intermediate-term pain and function (evidence type 3). For hip osteoarthritis, exercise was associated with small improvement in short-term function and pain versus usual care (evidence type 3). Functional improvement persisted at intermediate-term follow-up but pain improvement did not (evidence type 3).</paragraph>
<paragraph>Fibromyalgia. The AHRQ systematic clinical evidence review found exercise, mind-body practices, multidisciplinary rehabilitation, and acupuncture associated with small improvement in short-term function versus usual care or inactive treatments for fibromyalgia (evidence type 2 for acupuncture; evidence type 3 for others). At intermediate term, exercise, acupuncture, cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness-based stress reduction, myofascial release, and multidisciplinary rehabilitation were associated with improvements in function versus inactive treatments, usual care, or waiting list (evidence type 2 for exercise and acupuncture; evidence type 3 for others). Effects on intermediate-term function were moderate for cognitive behavioral therapy and small for the other therapies. At long term, multidisciplinary rehabilitation was associated with persistent small improvement in function versus usual care but not for pain (evidence type 3). Tai chi was associated with small improvement in function versus exercise at short-to intermediate-term follow-up (evidence type 3). Therapies associated with improved pain versus usual care, waiting list, no treatment, or inactive treatments were exercise (small effect, short and intermediate term; evidence type 2), cognitive behavioral therapy (small, short term; evidence type 3), mindfulness practices (small, intermediate term; evidence type 3), and multidisciplinary rehabilitation (small, intermediate term; evidence type 3).</paragraph>
<paragraph>Chronic Tension Headache. The AHRQ systematic clinical evidence review found spinal manipulation was associated with moderate improvement in short-term pain and small improvement in function versus usual care for chronic tension headache (evidence type 3). For other interventions, evidence was sparse, and the majority of trials had serious methodological limitations.</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Harms</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>Across conditions, data on harms of nonpharmacologic therapies were limited but no evidence suggested serious harms. Although reporting on harms was suboptimal, among studies that reported data, nonserious treatment-related adverse events (e.g., discomfort, soreness, bruising, increased pain, and worsening of symptoms) were infrequently reported, few withdrawals from nonpharmacologic therapies due to adverse events were reported, and no differences were found between comparison groups (either usual care or no nonpharmacologic therapy or another therapy) in the frequency of interventionrelated adverse events or withdrawals (evidence type 2 or 3).</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Nonopioid Pharmacologic Treatments for Chronic Pain Benefits</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>For neuropathic pain, the AHRQ systematic clinical evidence review (3) found anticonvulsants (gabapentin, pregabalin, and oxcarbazepine) were associated with small short-term improvement in pain versus placebo (evidence type 2), with no difference between pregabalin versus gabapentin enacarbil (evidence type 3). The antidepressant duloxetine was associated with small improvements in short-term pain, function, and quality of life versus placebo in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (evidence type 2 for pain and quality of life; evidence type 3 for function). Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) oral spray had inconsistent effects on pain in patients with multiple sclerosis or with allodynia (evidence type 3). Topical capsaicin was not associated with statistically significant effects on pain versus placebo, or effects were below the threshold for a small effect (evidence type 2).</paragraph>
<paragraph>For fibromyalgia, serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) antidepressants milnacipran and duloxetine were associated with small, short-and intermediate-term improvements in pain and quality of life versus placebo; a small beneficial effect on function was only observed at short-term (evidence type 2). Anticonvulsants pregabalin and gabapentin were associated with small short-term improvements in pain and function versus placebo; there were no effects on quality of life (evidence type 2). Memantine was associated with moderate intermediate-term improvements in pain, function, and quality of life versus placebo (evidence type 3).</paragraph>
<paragraph>For osteoarthritis, NSAIDs were associated with small shortterm improvement in pain (evidence type 2) and function (evidence type 1). Topical diclofenac was associated with small improvement in short-term pain (evidence type 2) and function (evidence type 3) versus placebo. Duloxetine was associated with small improvement in pain severity, function, and quality of life and moderate improvement in likelihood of a pain response (evidence type 1). Acetaminophen was not associated with improvement in pain or function versus placebo (evidence type 3).</paragraph>
<paragraph>For inflammatory arthritis, NSAIDs were associated with small improvements in short-term pain and function versus placebo (evidence type 2); effects on pain and function were small at intermediate-term follow-up (evidence type 3). At long-term follow-up, effects on pain were large, with no effects on function (evidence type 3).</paragraph>
<paragraph>For low back pain, duloxetine was associated with a small short-term improvement in pain intensity and likelihood of a pain response versus placebo; however, improvements in function and quality of life did not meet the threshold for small improvement (evidence type 2).</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Harms</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>Across all classes of nonopioid therapies, the AHRQ systematic clinical evidence review found that the incidence of serious adverse events was low; however, the trials were not designed to assess serious adverse events, and there were few serious adverse events (evidence type 3).</paragraph>
<paragraph>Antidepressants were associated with increased risk for withdrawal due to adverse events (WAE) versus placebo. SNRI antidepressants were associated with moderate to large increases in risk for nausea and excessive sweating (evidence type 2 or 3). Duloxetine was associated with a large, dose-dependent increase in sedation versus placebo (evidence type 2 or 3).</paragraph>
<paragraph>With regard to anticonvulsants, oxcarbazepine was associated with a large increase in risk for WAEs versus placebo (evidence type 2). Pregabalin and gabapentin were associated with moderate increased risk for WAEs (evidence type 2), with an association between higher dosages of pregabalin and increased risk. Pregabalin and gabapentin were associated with large increases in blurred vision, dizziness, weight gain, and cognitive effects (e.g., confusion) (evidence type 2). In addition, pregabalin was associated with large increases in risk for peripheral edema and sedation (evidence type 2).</paragraph>
<paragraph>NSAIDs were associated with increased risk for WAEs versus placebo; the magnitude was small for ibuprofen and diclofenac and moderate for naproxen (evidence type 2). There was no statistically significant increase in risk for any cardiovascular event for NSAIDs as a group; however, diclofenac was associated with a small increase in risk, particularly in the first 6 months, and with higher dosages (evidence type 2). Versus placebo, the risk for major coronary events was elevated with diclofenac and celecoxib (moderate effect) and with ibuprofen (large effect). For every 3,000 patients treated with diclofenac or celecoxib, there were an estimated three additional major coronary events. No difference was found in cardiovascular events between celecoxib versus nonselective NSAIDs in the intermediate or long term (evidence type 2). The risk for serious upper gastrointestinal events was increased with diclofenac (moderate effect) and ibuprofen or naproxen (large increase), particularly in the first 6 months of treatment (evidence type 1-2). In the intermediate term, diclofenac and naproxen were associated with large increase in risk for hepatic harms (evidence type 1-2).</paragraph>
<paragraph>Acetaminophen was not associated with increased risk for short-or intermediate-term WAEs versus placebo (evidence type 3). Capsaicin was associated with a large increase in risk for application site pain (evidence type 2) and a small increased risk for erythema (evidence type 3). Cannabis as US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention oral dronabinol solution was associated with a large increase in risk for dizziness, and as THC or CBD was associated with a large increase in risk for WAEs, dizziness, and nausea (evidence type 3).</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Treatments for Acute Pain</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>The AHRQ systematic clinical evidence review (4) found that most trials of treatments for acute pain focused on effects on pain at short-term (up to 1 week) follow-up. Evidence was somewhat stronger for pharmacologic than nonpharmacologic therapies.</paragraph>
<paragraph>For acute surgical dental pain (evidence type 3) and kidney stone pain (evidence type 2), the AHRQ systematic clinical evidence review found that opioids were associated with small to moderate increases in pain or need for rescue medication use versus NSAIDs. Findings for postoperative pain were somewhat inconsistent. Although opioids were associated with increased likelihood of repeat or rescue medication use at 1 day to 1 week (evidence type 3), evidence on pain intensity was insufficient due to inconsistency. Results for postoperative pain were based on a small number of trials and pain related to a limited set of surgical procedures (most commonly cesarean section, anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, knee arthroplasty, and cholecystectomy), limiting generalizability to other surgical procedures. Opioids were associated with increased risk for adverse events such as nausea, dizziness, and sedation versus nonopioid pharmacologic therapies (evidence type 2 or 3). The trials were not designed to assess serious adverse events, and few such events were reported. Evidence on opioids versus acetaminophen was somewhat mixed: for dental pain, the systematic clinical evidence review found opioids were associated with small improvement in pain outcomes on certain measures (evidence type 2) but for kidney stone pain, opioids were associated with a small increase in pain (evidence type 2). Evidence on NSAIDs versus acetaminophen was also somewhat mixed: for dental pain, evidence indicated that NSAIDs were associated with moderate to large decrease in pain (evidence type 2) but for kidney stone pain, evidence was insufficient. Evidence on nonopioid pharmacologic therapies other than NSAIDs or acetaminophen was very limited.</paragraph>
<paragraph>Evidence on nonpharmacologic therapies for acute pain was limited. For low back pain, the AHRQ systematic clinical evidence review found that heat therapy was associated with a moderate decrease in pain versus usual care or placebo at 1 day to <1 week and at 2 to <4 weeks (evidence type 2-3). For nonradicular low back pain, there might be no difference between spinal manipulation versus inactive controls (evidence type 2-3), although one trial of patients with radiculopathy found manipulation was associated with increased likelihood of improvement in pain at 2 to <4 weeks and at ≥4 weeks (evidence type 3)</paragraph>
<paragraph>Trials of opioid therapy for acute pain were not designed to evaluate effects on long-term use of opioids or outcomes such as misuse or development of opioid use disorder. Limited evidence from observational studies found that being prescribed an opioid for acute low back pain or after minor or elective surgical procedures was associated with increased likelihood of opioid use at longer term (e.g., 6 months or 1 year) follow-up (evidence type 3). Evidence on factors associated with opioid prescribing in patients with acute pain conditions was very limited and suggested that legislation mandating use of PDMP data before prescribing was not associated with decreases in opioid prescribing for low back pain or postoperative pain. No studies were identified that evaluated the accuracy or effectiveness of risk assessment instruments to inform use of opioids for acute pain.</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Treatments for Acute Episodic Migraine</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>The AHRQ review on treatments for acute episodic migraine (5) found limited evidence on the benefits and harms of opioids. The review found that opioids might be associated with decreased pain versus placebo but worse pain outcomes versus nonopioid pharmacologic therapy (evidence type 3). Most outcomes were assessed at short-term (2 hours or 1 day) follow-up. Opioids were associated with increased risk for adverse events, although evidence on serious adverse events was lacking. No studies were found on instruments for predicting opioid misuse, opioid use disorder, overdose, or risk mitigation strategies in patients prescribed opioids for migraine.</paragraph>
<paragraph>The AHRQ review found stronger (type 1 or 2) evidence supporting the effectiveness of multiple established nonopioid pharmacologic therapies for improving pain resolution in acute episodic migraine, including triptans, NSAIDs, dihydroergotamine, and ergotamine plus caffeine. Evidence also favored antiemetics versus placebo or no antiemetic but was more limited (evidence type 3). Newer treatments (calcitonin gene-related peptide [CGRP] antagonists [gepants], and lasmiditan [a 5-HT1F receptor agonist]) were associated with reduced pain and improved function versus placebo (evidence type 2 or 3). However, lasmiditan was associated with increased risk for serious adverse events (most commonly, dizziness; evidence type 3); evidence on serious adverse events of CGRP antagonists was insufficient.</paragraph>
<paragraph>Evidence on nonpharmacologic therapy for acute episodic migraine was sparse. Moderate evidence (evidence type 2) supported remote electrical neuromodulation. More limited evidence (evidence type 3) supported acupuncture, chamomile oil, external trigeminal nerve stimulation, and eye movement desensitization reprocessing. Evidence was insufficient to determine risk for serious adverse events with nonpharmacologic therapies for acute episodic migraine.</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Contextual Evidence Review</sectionHeader>

<sectionHeader>Patient and Clinician Values and Preferences</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>Opioids for Chronic Pain. The contextual evidence review conducted for the 2016 CDC Opioid Prescribing Guideline (8) found data indicating that physicians frequently lacked confidence in their ability to safely prescribe opioids, predict or identify prescription medication misuse or opioid use disorder, or discuss these issues with their patients. Clinicians reported favorable beliefs and attitudes about effects of opioids on pain and quality of life; however, they also had concerns about risk for opioid use disorder and overdose yet did not consistently use risk mitigation strategies (e.g., use of PDMP data, urine toxicology testing, or opioid treatment agreements). Evidence on patient values and preferences was limited but indicated unfamiliarity with certain terms ("opioids"), more familiarity with the term "narcotics" but an association between "narcotics" and "addiction" or "abuse," and concerns about addiction and abuse. Side effects such as nausea, constipation, and somnolence (rather than pain relief ) accounted for most of the variation in patient preferences regarding use of opioids. Patients prescribed high-dose opioids reported reliance on opioids and ambivalence or uncertainty about benefits and side effects.</paragraph>
<paragraph>The AHRQ review identified new information on preferences and values. A survey of 961 clinicians found that 82% were reluctant to prescribe opioids and less than half (47%) expressed confidence in caring for patients with chronic noncancer pain</paragraph>
<paragraph>Regarding patient preferences and values, a new systematic review found that among various opioid-related outcomes (effects), patients ranked pain relief, nausea, and vomiting as most important, followed by constipation</paragraph>
<paragraph>Noninvasive Nonpharmacologic Treatments for Chronic Pain. The contextual evidence review found that evidence on patient values and preferences related to noninvasive nonpharmacologic treatments for chronic pain was limited. A Gallup poll found that 78% of Americans preferred nonpharmacologic therapies (e.g., physical therapy and chiropractic care) to address pain over prescribed pain medication</paragraph>
<paragraph>Nonopioid Pharmacologic Treatments for Chronic Pain. The contextual evidence review found limited evidence on clinician and patient values and preferences related to nonopioid pharmacologic treatments. Evidence described variability in patient preferences regarding nonopioid pharmacologic treatments, interest in medical cannabis, cost as an important consideration, high priority on pain reduction as well as side effects and harms (including risk for opioid use disorder), and high value for having alternatives to opioids</paragraph>
<paragraph>Treatments for Acute Pain. The contextual evidence review found limited evidence suggesting variability in patient values and preferences regarding treatments for acute pain</paragraph>
<paragraph>Treatments for Acute Episodic Migraine. The contextual evidence review found very limited evidence on clinician and patient values and preferences related to treatments for acute episodic migraine. One survey found that patients with headaches (primarily episodic or chronic migraine) prioritized efficacy of treatment over the safety or route of administration and preferred oral over parenteral medications</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>Costs and Cost-Effectiveness</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>Opioid Therapy for Chronic Pain. The contextual evidence review conducted for the 2016 CDC Opioid Prescribing Guideline estimated (on the basis of studies published after 2010) yearly direct and indirect costs related to prescription opioids at $53.4 billion for nonmedical use of prescription opioids; $55.7 billion for abuse, dependence (i.e., opioid use disorder), and misuse of prescription opioids; and $20.4 billion for opioid-related overdoses</paragraph>
<paragraph>The AHRQ report included data that estimated the total economic burden of fatal overdose, abuse, and dependence of prescription opioids in 2013 at $78.5 billion, with $28.9 billion related to increased health care and substance use disorder treatment costs</paragraph>
<paragraph>No study was identified that formally evaluated the costeffectiveness of opioid therapy versus no opioid therapy or nonopioid pharmacologic therapy for noncancer pain. A modeling study that estimated 80% of opioid overdose deaths to be attributable to illicit opioids projected that interventions targeting prescription opioid misuse (e.g., prescription monitoring programs) would decrease the number of opioid overdose deaths by 3.0%-5.3%</paragraph>
<paragraph>Noninvasive Nonpharmacologic Treatments for Chronic Pain. The contextual evidence review found that for nonpharmacologic treatments covered by commercial insurers, out-of-pocket costs ranged from $25 to $60 per visit ($150-$720 for a 6-to 12-visit course of therapy)</paragraph>
<paragraph>Nonopioid Pharmacologic Treatments for Chronic Pain. The contextual evidence review found certain evidence indicating that nonopioid pharmacologic therapies are cost-effective for chronic pain. For osteoarthritis and low back pain, there was evidence that nonopioid pharmacologic therapies (NSAIDs and duloxetine) are cost-effective versus opioids</paragraph>
<paragraph>Treatments for Acute Pain. The contextual evidence review found limited evidence that exercise was cost-effective for acute low back pain and interdisciplinary rehabilitation cost-effective for low back pain that was identified as high risk for becoming chronic</paragraph>
<paragraph>Treatments for Acute Episodic Migraine. The contextual evidence review found that studies on costs and cost-effectiveness of treatments for acute episodic migraine focused almost exclusively on triptans. Triptans were consistently found to be associated with low costs per pain-free episode and other outcomes (e.g., migraine-disability days averted)</paragraph>

<sectionHeader>A Note on Historically Used Terms</sectionHeader>
<paragraph>Historically, terms such as "abuse," "drug abuse," and "opioid abuse" have been used in research and diagnostic terminology. For example, opioid use disorder, defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) as a problematic pattern of opioid use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress</paragraph>
